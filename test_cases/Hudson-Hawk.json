THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY \nBeneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS and roaring puppets is unfolding. \nRUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment. \nEncircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap. \nEveryone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up. \nUNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER Leonardo, che pazzo. \nThe juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle... \nINT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE \nwhere the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun- glasses with his trademark beard. \nHe turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio- syncrasies. \nTWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance laser show. \nDA VINCI (silencing authority) Basta vapore. \nThe apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for- ward with tongs. \nA LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS \ncomes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat. \nThe tongs enter the frame. \nDa Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master peers at the smoking yellow bar. \nAPPRENTICE TWO Maestro, che meraviglia! \nAPPRENTICE THREE Lei e' proprio fantastico! \nDa Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit. \nDA VINCI Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo! \nThe apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes. \nDA VINCI L'ho fatto. \nSpinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop. \nINT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP \nWith an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop, sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the other. \nHis workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies. \nANTONY Welcome back, buddy ol' pal. We've got a proposition... \nHAWK Answer's no, not even if you bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario, how's the \"Family?\"  Kill any monkeys lately? \nCESAR How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, \"endearing.\" \nHAWK Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to... \nSmouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding on the hood. \nCESAR You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie... \nHAWK Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand. \nANTONY (defensively) Yeah, directions even I could understand. \nThe car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling hands. \nCESAR Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas... \nHAWK If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt. \nHawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into Cesar's hands. \nCESAR What's your favorite sport, Hawk? \nHAWK Baseball, why? \nAntony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says \"Baseball.\"  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs up as Antony moves threateningly toward him. \nHAWK I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd rather go back in than whore for you... (stopping) Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars. \nA PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness. Hawk feebly calls up to him. \nHAWK Help?  Police? \nAntony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf. Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat of the car. \nCESAR (unfazed) You need some time to think. That's cool, but next time, I'm not going to say \"Please.\" \nCesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off. Hawk seethes... \nHAWK I don't believe this.  I've been out forty seconds... \nA BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking it is a gunshot. \nHAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V. \nA gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too- fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best friend. \nALEX That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything? \nHAWK (getting up) Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day. \nALEX Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated. \nHawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex. \nALEX Where's the kiss?  No tongue this time, I promise. \nA laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before getting in the car.... \nHAWK Looks like you've been expanding your... \nALEX Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure. \nHAWK My next word was gonna be \"consciousness.\"  Swear to God... tubby. \nEXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY \nThe Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. \"Come Fly With Me\" is playing on the radio.  Hawk casually com- pletes an intimidating hand puzzle. \nHAWK That's your definition of \"Hard?\" \nTwo Security Guards sit before a console of seven security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke. Wires coming out of the security console run across the floor and through the wall into... \nINT. THE POWER ROOM \nThe wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button flashing V.C.R.s.  Hawk and Alex stand before them, sharing a cig. \nALEX They record everything their video surveillance takes in... \nHAWK Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan... \nAlex presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s. \nALEX Am I boring you, smartass?  Watch. A little rewind and re-wire action and the Guards are going to be watching a rerun and miss out on our exciting episode. \nAlex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked MONDAY. \nINT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT \nMoving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a turbo Floor Washer. \nNext to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back and snooze. \nINT. GUARDS' STATION \nThe Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze. \nSECURITY GUARD ONE Check out Big Stan... (walkie-talkie) Big Stan! \nTHE AUCTION AUDITORIUM \nStartled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the little chair, crunching it to the ground. \nTHE FIRST FLOOR \nThe laughing security guards see the crunch. \nINT. THE POWER ROOM \nAlex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a V.C.R. \nALEX You got about five minutes and change. \nHAWK 5:32.  \"Swinging on a Star.\" \nALEX You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch. \nA freight elevator pings.  Hawk opens it up as the music of \"Swinging on the Star\" kicks in on the soundtrack. \nHAWK \"A mule is an animal with long funny ears.\" \nALEX \"He kicks up at anything he hears. \nHawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his Glad bag.  Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when Hawk isn't. \nINT. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR \nHawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator. \nHAWK \"Or would you rather swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar.\" \nPOWER ROOM \nAlex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large Switches.  The soundtrack singers continue to warble. \nTHE GUARDS' STATION \nThe lights of the floor wobble and die.  The console screens blink off.  The Security Guards stop laughing. \nSECURITY GUARD TWO Hell-o.  Check the Power room, bud... \nSecurity Guard One harrumphs into a standing position... \nPOWER ROOM \nHAWK \"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo.\" \nALEX (V.O.) \"Every day you meet quite a few.\" \nAlex gives Hawk a congratulatory pat. \nHAWK AND ALEX \"So you see it's all up to you. You can be better than you are. You could be swinging on a star.\" \nTHE AUCTION ROOM \nBIG STAN reconnects the wires of the seventh V.C.R. \nTHE GUARDS' STATION \nSuddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on. \nSECURITY GUARD ONE Shit, let's roll! \nTHE AUCTION AUDITORIUM \nHawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the playful children. \nALEX The song's over!  Come on! \"You could be swinging on a star.\" \nHAWK What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy. \nALEX (more frantically) \"You could be swinging on a star.\" \nHAWK Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is... \nHawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and Two crash into the auction auditorium. \nALEX (DEADPAN) \"You could be swinging on a star.\" You couldn't have waited to see a psychiatrist.  No, you had... \nAlex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and trip the Guards into a bellyflop. \nHawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them into Alex's thumbcuffs.  He then limbos under their connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer cord.  The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip themselves. \nHAWK Let's go down the freight elevator. \nBig Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator. \nALEX Keep those ideas coming. \nHawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right wall.  They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over before simultaneously bashing through the office door. \nINT. DARKENED AUCTION AUDITORIUM OFFICE \nHawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and rub their funny bones.  Alex stops laughing. \nALEX I'm not as unpleasantly plump as that Guard am I. \nBig Stan fires off a warning shot.  Hawk and Alex quickly tear up a window. \nMoving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the huge auction house awning and trade gulps. \nBig Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door. \nHAWK AND ALEX I got a bad feeling.... \nHAWK I can't even swim. \nALEX Hell, the fall'll probably kill ya... \nBig Stan raises his gun. \nHawk and Alex jump and AAAGH down the face of the building.... \nCloser and closer to the awning.... \nThe viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls...... \nCUT TO: \nALFRED Ta ta, Hudson Hawk. \nHAWK (breathless) Too-do-loo, babe. \nINT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--DAWN \nHawk bursts into the bar.  Alex sits on a stool, reading the paper. \nALEX Did I miss anything? \nHAWK Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way. \nALEX Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to? \nHawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle with the cappuccino machine. \nHAWK The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.. \nALEX (professorial) Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's \"Sforza,\" an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things. \nThe cappuccino machine sparks.  A perplexed Hawk takes a couple extra seconds to back off. \nHAWK Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS. \nALEX (holding up newspaper) Morning edition.  Seems two thieves \"attempted\" to steal it last night, but thanks to three \"courageous\" guards, it will be ready for tonight. \nHAWK \"Attempted.\"  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I.... \nHawk takes the newspaper.  There is a picture of the Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the \"Sforza.\"  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs. \nHAWK Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand... \nALEX Why try? \nHAWK (hurdling the bar) Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up. \nALEX (pulling back newspaper) You re not thinking of going to... \nHAWK Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux? \nINT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT \nDressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs all set out).  Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator. \nECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER ...fan-taas-tic example of Florentine marble... Who will start at 160,000...160,000......180,000. \nSomeone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage. Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one seated next to him, AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. \nHAWK All these years of attending auctions, I still get goosebumps.  The paintings, the sculptures....the things that aren't really paintings or sculptures... \nTHE WOMAN .... the pretentious vultures who don't even look up from their calculators to see what they're buying.  Now that gives me goosebumps.  Auctions are disgusting. \nHAWK I couldn't agree more.  Savages. \nThe Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself. \nECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce attributed to the Cellini school.. \nAUCTION ENTRANCE \nBig Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area wearing a blue ribbon. \nAUCTION AREA \nBig Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE, A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER, and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara. \nTHREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of phones set up down before the stage.  One raises his arm. \nECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER Sold!  To the caller from Newfoundland. \nA STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica of the \"Sforza\" from the safe behind the podium and brings it to the Auctioneer.  The crowd a-a-hs... Hawk laughs and shakes his head. \nECCENTRIC BALD AUTIONEER And finally, Lot number 17, thought to be lost in the war, and again last night, the Da Vinci \"Sforza,\" the jewel of the sale.  Fan-taas-tic... \nANNA My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that... \nHAWK Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse... \nANNA No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of \"watch out, Anna\" would have done nicely... \nHAWK Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners. \nAnna touches Hawk's lips and laughs. \nANNA (\"Hey, I was kidding\") Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you? \nHAWK (Serious answer? Na-a-h?) Because Danger, Doc, is my middle... \nBefore Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere hammers him into the ground and the viewer into darkness. \nFADE IN: \nINT. VAN-TYPE AMBULANCE--NIGHT \nHawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated gurney. \nHAWK Saint Pete, hey I know, the whole cat burglar thing, it sounds bad, but I'll take the worst cloud you got... \nHawk's eyes focus.  The Mario Brothers hover over him. \nCESAR News flash.  You're not in heaven.  Yet.  30 seconds and counting, if you know what I'm saying.  Couldn't just play along, could you... \nEXT. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE--NIGHT \nThe ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge. \nINT. INSIDE THE AMBULANCE \nAntony raises up a mammoth gun. \nHAWK Pretty class way of covering your tracks.  I think that auctioneer landed at La Guardia. \nANTONY Subtlety was never one of our strong points. \nHAWK Neither's flossing. \nA confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand. Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul- ishly quiver.  Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the partition. \nFRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE \nThe Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white, freaks at the starred windshield. \nTHE BROOKLYN BRIDGE \nThe ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars. \nINSIDE THE AMBULANCE \nHawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches it backward. \nOUTSIDE BACK OF AMBULANCE \nThe elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it. \nThe gurney wheels hit the road, sparking. \nA sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks TAUGHT --Hawk is \"water skiing\" on his stomach atop the elevated gurney! \nScreeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the road. \nTHE GURNEY \nBattered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface. \nThe sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing off to the side on its own crazed volition. \nHawk skis toward a TOLL BOOTH WITH A LARGE GATE-ARM. \nHAWK But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge. \nKAPLAN I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief... \nHAWK To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle. \nAs Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk. \nKAPLAN I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, \"We've only just begun.\" \nHAWK Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another... \nKAPLAN Hush.  My employer wants a meeting. \nHAWK Employer?  The president? \nKAPLAN No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there? \nHAWK I'm supposed to fall for that? \nKAPLAN Shucks.  Guess not. \nKaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face, knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase. Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL sticker. \nINT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY \nHawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping, take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as \"O Solo Mio\" blares on the soundtrack. \nHAWK No.  Way. \nHawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase. \nALFRED Welcome to Rome, sir. \nHAWK Yes way. \nEXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY \nAlfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower- logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in... \nINT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE \nfacing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the cellular. \nWhile he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand, then holding up one finger in a \"be with you in a sec\" facial move. \nDARWIN For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide! (slamming phone) Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle? \nHAWK You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole? \nDARWIN Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead. \nA FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles. \nDARWIN What can I tell you, I'm the villain.  Initially it was a priority to keep a lot of buffers between you and me, but since most of them are dead now, I thought what the heck.  Hawk, you come highly recommended.  I would have done some things differently at the auction house, but hey, I want to be in business with you. \nDarwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then shoves it into a violent paper shredder. \nOUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER \nShredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door. \nINSIDE THE LIMOUSINE \nA simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings. \nHAWK My life is not some deal.  I... \nALFRED (O.S.) It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower. \nDARWIN I'm sorry, I have to take this. Those are valid points though... \nDarwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving Hawk \"Can you believe this guy\"-type gestures. \nANNA I'll bring my entire repertoire... \nThe Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking around.  Anna and Hawk crouch down. \nHAWK And I'll bring my entourage... \nANNA Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30. \nHAWK Said. \nHawk and Anna peck each other with a smile.  He crawls out an exit door.  As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears. She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding bang on the head.  She then darts to a large crucifix and looks up. \nANNA Father, it's obvious.  He's up to something. \nSuddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles. \nJESUS (Italian) Report downstairs at once. \nANNA Yes, sir. \nINT. CATACOMBLIKE AREA \nA CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area.  Anna clacks up to him. \nCARDINAL Did he mention the Mayflowers? \nANNA No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week. \nCARDINAL Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically? \nANNA That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said \"Polite conversation is rarely either.\" \nCARDINAL (chuckling) Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man. \nANNA (unconvinced) Yeah.  The big E. \nEXT. NAVONA PIAZZA--DAY \nThe evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate painters and swings into... \nINT. A BIG QUIRKY PHONE BOOTH \nHawk grabs up the phone and dials.... \nHAWK Hello, operator.  I'd like to make a collect call to New York number... \nThe Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza, behind an oblivious Hawk. \nHAWK Thank you, operator, thank you. \nHawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  Seeing the limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner. \nHAWK Come on, Alex, pick up, you Reindeer goat cheese-eating motherfucker. \nINT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT \nIt is late night in New York.  A phone rings atop the bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight. \nINT. PIAZZA--DAY \nHawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding Bunny) emerge from the limousine.  As he turns his con- centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the limo. \nHAWK A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex. \nHawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine pull off. \nHawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as a mailman. \nCrumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot, into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the booth. \nHawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns; Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.  Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip. Hawk gives him a double take. \nKAPLAN Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician. \nINT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT \nA BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling on. \nTHE CODEX ROOM \nRubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a pocket fisherman.... \nThe viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down the hall. \nOUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM \nBurly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room. He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now empty mirror-frame then REALIZES. \nMuttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor deflecting mirrors. \nHe passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to be standing. \nBurly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk. \nThe Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window on the other side of the room. \nThe familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard pulls it on and gives a \"That's Life\" shrug of shoulders to the fainting Guard three. \nHawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the shattered window. \nThe Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving chase. \nEXT. THE ROOF \nHawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS. His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof, landing against the antennae. \nINT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM \nA T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it. \nEXT. THE ROOF \nHawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag. \nThe Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a warning shot. \nHawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the Guard continues to bound forward. \nHAWK Please God, Please God.......let the guard shoot me. \nHawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican Guard hovering over him on the roof. \nVATICAN GUARD The worm's on the other foot, yankee noodle candy. \nHawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof. \nEXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL \nHawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his breathtaking ride. \nThe brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down. \nHAWK \nis alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream... and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost. His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails down upon... \nEXT. A BUS \nand the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes flying off... \nEXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT \nPanting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag. \nANNA Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by.... \nHAWK I never break a date.  Scout's honor. \nMINERVA Like a \"cat\", one could say. \nHAWK Shucks, I'll just take it back. \nHawk reaches for the Codex.  Kaplan pulls it over to Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit it open. \nMINERVA (bouncing up) No, let me! \nDARWIN (pout) I don't care. \nHawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange machine parts behind them. \nMinerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri- cally perverted crystal. \nHAWK Another piece of the puzzle for the Da Vinci Alchemy project. \nKaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each other, all start to speak, then all stop. \nThis quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin Flunkies. \nDARWIN Oh, you.  There's nothing more I hate than failure.  All you had to do was follow the Hawk, it's not like I said \"Teach our nation's children how to read.\" \nHawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets. \nDARWIN I guess we're just going to have to kill 'em... \nShockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground. \nDARWIN God Minerva, I was kidding. \nA SHOCKED HAWK \nquickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead. \nTHE MAYFLOWERS \nreverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained, Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets. \nMINERVA Get away from there, convict! \nHAWK Just browsing.  Don't touch me.... \nSnickers touches him.  Hawk smashes him in the jaw. Snickers rears back to reciprocate.... \nDARWIN Don't hurt him!  We need him for the final job! \nSnickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  Hawk is suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy. \nHAWK Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  Even if I do this.... \nHawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them. \nHAWK And this.... \nHawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach. \nHAWK Surely this must offend.... \nHawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the ground.  Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns. \nKAPLAN That's it! \nPlayfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and manually swivels her hips to the beat of his. \nHAWK Things are getting a little loose at the Da Vinci workshop tonight. \"Put your left leg in, take your right foot out.\"  May I call you Minnie.... \nHawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's crotch.  Hawk stops dancing. \nDARWIN Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job... \nHAWK Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on.... \nAlfred moves the blade a little upward.  Hawk a-a-ghs. \nDARWIN (casually goosing Alfred) Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold! \nMINERVA Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop. \nDARWIN Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin. \nHAWK Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex... \nMINERVA Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball! \nMinerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a tennis ball into its mouth. \nDARWIN I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom! \nHAWK You want an address on that last one? \nBunny barks up at Hawk in anger. \nHAWK Bunny, not you too? \nMINERVA You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it. \nAlfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs and the blindfold.  The viewer's viewpoint stays on a writhing Hawk. \nHAWK I'll kill all you.  Even the old lady. \nHawk kicks back on the table, \"jump ropes\" the cuffs, then picks the lock with his teeth.  Hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous Italian leather coat. \nALEX I hated cigarettes until I saw my first No Smoking sign.  Keep off the Grass?  Let's play Soccer. Only law I cared about was friendship.  Broke that one too, didn't I?  This Gates-Mario Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal. Visit foreign lands, take their treasures.  I don't know, I thought you'd get into it.  It's better than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at the bar.  I didn't know it was going to be like this.  Them using me to use you... I'm sorry, there's only one way out of this and it's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you. \nAlex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in. \nEXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY \nThe piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling. Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps.  The other agents stroll in the periphery.... \nKAPLAN I just don't think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone. \nMINERVA Don't worry George, this is the reason we put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with.  To keep Hawk in line. They'll talk about \"being buddies\" and \"chugging brewskis.\" \nDARWIN (raising glass) You gotta love male bonding. \nAs Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building. \nKAPLAN You were saying... \nMoving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling.  The wigging out passers- by give them space. \nHAWK You bastard!  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job! \nAlex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.  He shakily raises his gun. \nALEX Hawk... I'm so sorry... \nHawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin, Minerva, and the CIA who react with \"This can't be happening\" catatonia. \nTwo SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes. \nHAWK No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't go out like this. \nHawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him. Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up. Snickers stops. \nFour policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van. The other two drag in Alex. \nThe villains look to each other for non-existent guidance as the van pulls away. \nMINERVA Plan B, anyone... \nUsing initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off after them.  The van can be seen swerving off..... \nAROUND A CORNER \nwhere it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn way. \nWind blows through the shattered conference room window. Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the table with the Mayflowers and the other agents. \nKAPLAN We're all family now.  My team has done a lot of rougher things than steal the model of a helicopter. \nSNICKERS We're going to whack this place so fast we'll have time to shop for American imports. \nDarwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to each other with knowing looks.  The computer screen shows the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later see. \nALMOND JOY Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards.... \nKAPLAN As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor... \nINT. A VAN-BUS--NIGHT \nA head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing of what was so neatly delineated on the CIA computer. Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum. \nALEX We're going in from the ground floor. \nHAWK Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm. \nHawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  Anna is revealed to be driving in her habit.  Hawk gives her a kiss. \nHAWK Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously. \nANNA Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports. \nHAWK Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum. \nHawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag Hawk holds. \nALEX The security's actually not that severe. \nANNA It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails. \nHawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of Budapest. \nHAWK Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was \"Who Shot J.R.?\" \nALEX You sound disappointed. \nHAWK Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard... \nTHE VAN \npasses a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance. \nHAWK (V.O.) It's supposed to be parachuting in the moonlight.... \nEXT. THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN--NIGHT \nKaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their parachutes. \nSnickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at the top of the building and a flashing green one inside. \nSNICKERS We are the blue light.  The green light is where the Art Treasures room is. \nKAPLAN Let's go make a purple light. Where's Kit Kat? \nEXT. THE KREMLIN GROUNDS \nDressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk, Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.  They scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance. \nALEX Delivery Entrance.  Low Security. \nANNA Gum. \nAll three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag. \nHAWK Count of three? \nALEX Why not just go now? \nHAWK Okay. \nWith a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster through the rooftop door into another hallway, where SOVIET GUARDS TWO AND THREE are taking it easy. \nKAPLAN Create a diversion. \nSnickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini-Uzis. \nSOVIET GUARD FOUR rushes out a door before the agents, zipping up his fly.  Almond Joy twists his neck with an agonizing SNAP. \nTHE LONG HALLWAY \nHawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural through the windowed double doors. \nBehind the doors, they poke up to see a BESPECTACLED GUARD emerge from the darkness to check out the door. \nALEX Now that's a lock. \nHAWK Don't worry, we'll get it... \nANNA Can I sing this time, too? Please? \nHawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's eye flutter does it. \nHAWK Uh, I guess so. \nThe Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness. \nTHE BALLROOM \nThe Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them. \nDARWIN I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children. \nMINERVA (smiling) We're here to say, your government was right. \nDARWIN So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals. \nAT THE LOCK \nAlex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver. They are improvising... \nHAWK \"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt\" \nALEX \"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt\" \nAnna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and Alex can barely concentrate. \nANNA \"But we'll travel the road, Sharing the load.  Side by Side!\" \nTHE HALLWAY ABOVE \nThe CIA team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex are working on. \nSnickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light. \nSNICKERS This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created... \nALMOND JOY Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb... \nButterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle.  He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  He fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking. \nBEHIND THE WINDOWED DOUBLE DOORS \ncome Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting. \nHAWK That was close.... \nALEX Anna, I think you better stay.... \nHAWK You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun. \nAlex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little Sister not allowed to play.  Hawk and Alex go back through the doors. \nTHE HALLWAY ABOVE \nKaplan is bugging out. \nKAPLAN Damnit, this isn't the plan! Blue light, green light, shit! Snickers, Kit Kat, A.J., scramble, see if you can find out anything. \nThey thunder out.  Hawk, still in Butterfinger's oblivious clutches, shouts.. \nHAWK Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you... \nKAPLAN They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach. \nHAWK I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie. \nKaplan raises his gun. \nTHE BALLROOM BANQUET \nDarwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises a glass of vodka in the other. \nDARWIN You're helping us achieve a goal and in return, I'm giving you a key to the world's executive washroom.  Don't piss it away.... Skoal, amigos... \nANNA (O.S.) Stop or I'll shoot. \nMinerva and some various Soviet VIPS spew their vodka to look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the second level.  She is shivering, shaking the gun. \nANNA You people are immoral and narcissitic and I won't let you... \nIn unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table begin machine gunning up at her.  She dives behind the railing. \nTHE ART TREASURES ROOM \nKaplan lowers his gun. \nKAPLAN I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick. (raising back up his gun) I never thought I'd say \"I'm just in this job for the money.\"  Sad. Any last immature quips? \nHAWK No. (a beat) But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt? \nFalling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger looks down to his shirt. \nBUTTERFINGER What blood stains.... \nHawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger. Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the ground, pinning his head to the floor.  The Gold Hammer next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's skull. \nHAWK You want immature, how 'bout an egg fight... \nHawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals to the ground, geysering blood. \nHawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex. \nHAWK Alex, are you.... \nALEX I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome \nHAWK You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there... \nTHE BALLROOM \nBullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload. \nSnickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall- way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight of Anna.... \nALMOND JOY Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I have to cut out your heart for real now.  It's not personal. \nAnna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and pulls out a knife. \nALMOND JOY You won't shoot.  I read your dossier... Sister. \nThe Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure. \nAlmond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone ballet. \nALMOND JOY I gotta get a new job... \nSnickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men, Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross- bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers with some graphic success. \nHAWK Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit. \nSNICKERS Too bad. \nSnickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head. \nHawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of the stairs, holding the strange rifle. \nDarwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance.  They start to trot off... \nMINERVA I knew it!  I told you it was a fake. \nDARWIN That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million? \nMINERVA Million five, lover... \nHAWK \nboots Snickers down the stairs.  Snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb. \nSnickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch. \nSNICKERS Help me you Democratic Reform lovers!  Get a screwdriver, you Stupid Eskimoes!  Screw-dri-ver! Oh God, I always wanted to know how to play the harp, there just was so little time!  Rosebud! \nThe soldiers high-tail it out.  Snickers plugs his ears. Nothing happens. \nSNICKERS Maybe it was just a.... \nSnickers blows up gloriously before the M. \nTHE STAIRCASE \nHawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps. \nALEX Get 'em.  They went down the hallway. \nHAWK Let's just forget it, I mean... \nALEX Get em.... \nHawk rushes up the. stairs, gives a \"What can I do?\" glance to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past a pillar.  Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward. \nTHE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY \nHawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall- way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness. \nTHE BALLROOM \nMinera sits down next to the pained Alex. \nMINERVA Alex.  How's it going? \nALEX Go, go to Hell, to Hell. \nMinerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open. \nMINERVA Where's your insulin....No?  Well, Bon Appetite. \nMinerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth. \nTHE HALLWAY \nHawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk kicks him off... \nHAWK Oh, come on.... \nTHE BALLROOM \nAlex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering. \nMINERVA Very good, Alex, but you re still alive.... \nShe pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last burst of strength, punches her across the face. \nTHE BALLROOM \nHawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead. \nHAWK Oh, honey.... \nHawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way he left him.  Hawk rushes to him. \nHAWK We did it man, we... \nHawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD. \nEngaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back to the ground. \nHawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred, bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch, but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face. \nThe Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene. \nINT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY \nA damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters.  \"O Solo Mio\" returns on the sound- track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci. \nHawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss. \nANNA Oh Hudson... \nHAWK I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at... \nANNA Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent. \nHAWK (cut-off laugh) This is too bad to be false. \nAlfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still polite. \nALFRED Welcome back to Vinci. \nHAWK Last rites, sister? \nANNA Please, no nun jokes...They're a bad habit to get into....get it? \nHawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause. \nHAWK She killed Alex. \nAlfred gives them a push. \nINT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP \nAlfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball machine. \nINT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY \nAlfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals. \nMINERVA (O.S.) GOLD-FI-ING-ER! \nHawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral-wear. \nMINERVA Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're probably wondering why you're still alive.  Anna..... \nAs Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it. \nMINERVA I want you to monitor the Da Vinci's directions from the apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I didn't want you to go to hell without knowing that Darwin and I's dream came true. (suddenly sheepish) Beside that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together. Alfie and I were up all night with the thing. \nTECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground. \nHAWK You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold? \nMINERVA It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble. \nHAWK Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist? \nMINERVA You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say \"How could this happen to me?\"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME! \nOblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a religious purr. \nTHE MACHINE \ntriggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room. \nOUTSIDE THE MACHINE \nHawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles, A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward. \nTHE MACHINE \nBeams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar! \nMINERVA \nsees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set. \nMINERVA Eureka, motherfuckers! \nThe machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace. \nHawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set. \nHAWK'S VOICE (head-set) Minnie, hate to interrupt your orgasm, but.... \nHAWK AND ANNA \nstand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on head-set. \nHAWK Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna say you got the Midas touch, baby... \nMACHINE \nMinerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion. \nThe center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer. \nMirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls. \nMinerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti. \nHAWK AND ANNA \nturn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted on his chest, ALFRED! \nALFRED How. \nHAWK You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over. \nALFRED (strange voiced) My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses! \nHAWK Ooh-kay... \nAlfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats. \nAnna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires... \nright into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him back with a strong punch. \nANNA Sorry! \nShe fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle. \nHAWK Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not kill! \nHawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft. Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's throat. \nGasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the hinge. \nAlfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the \"V\" hits it-- \nHAWK Don't lose your head over this. \n", "test1_input": "GATES' TABLE \nGates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with terrifying precision.  Hawk tosses the badge onto the food.  Gates eats around it. \nGATES Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job. \nHAWK What job? \nGates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the table. \nGATES The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie. \nHAWK The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute. \nGates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS. \nGATES You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges... \nHAWK How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying \"Soitinly.\" \nGates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile. \nGATES Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself? \nHAWK Yes. \nGATES Remember that shoe you lost... \nHAWK Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase. \nGates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table. \nGATES One phone call and your shoe will become a piece of evidence and that suicide'll become a murder. \nHawk bobs under the table and up. \nHAWK What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame. \nGATES That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con. \nAlex suddenly approaches the table. \nALEX How is everything tonight, sir? \nGATES Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur. \nHAWK Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here... \nALEX Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon. \nGATES (mouthful) You're full of shit. \nAs Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens. \nALEX No, man, actually you are.  Just add water and it makes its own gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy and your coat shiny. \nGates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table between them. \nINT. BACK ROOM--DAWN \nHawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him, Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's \"Witchcraft\" blares on the radio.... \nALEX Hmmmm..... \nHAWK Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this. \nHawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old, \"true\" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of granny classes and pulls out blueprints. \nHAWK It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain..... \nALEX Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th. \nHawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed. Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job syncopation and speak rapid-fire. \n", "test1_true": "ALEX Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it. \nHAWK But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas. \nALEX Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene. \nAlex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs. \nHAWK This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I... \nALEX There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen. \nHAWK You're not...LISTENING! \nOut of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little wounded. \nHAWK I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds? \nALEX Rutherford Auction... that name... \nAlex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain. \nHAWK Alex! \nALEX Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  \"Witchcraft.\" What's the running time? \nAlex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of drawings of different kinds of vaults.  He sets himself up for an insulin injection. \nHAWK 3:48.  I can't get you involved, man.  This is my sewage and... (re drawings) God, you love all this, don't you, you bastard.  Haven't you ever heard of stamp collecting, or curling? \nHawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to Alex. \nALEX I'm in.  Have you seen the public service announcements for Diabetes. We can ride horses, play LaCrosse, and knock off auction houses.  I got a plan.  You won't have to hail Cesar or Gates. \nHawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate. \nHAWK I'm a bum. \nEXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT \nTWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags. They are drunkenly warbling \"Witchcraft.\"  IMPECCABLY DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth. \nOur derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.  A DOORMAN shoos them away... \nA NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House. The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back. \nThe Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen. \nThe Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge that connects the Auction House with another Building. \nLaunching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them- selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes beneath. \nAT THE WINDOW \nThe viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge, each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a plunger. \nHAWK Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that. \nALEX Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle. \nINT. INSIDE THE WALKWAY WINDOW--NIGHT \nHawk and Alex come through their window holes.  Hawk immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper- ing... \nHAWK Cameras? \nALEX No need.  Guards' station's right there. \nAlex points to an open doorway just down the hall where laughter and shadows emerge.  Hawk tries to flee, but a grinning Alex pulls him toward it. \nHawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards' Station.  The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and Alex lock-picking into the Power room to... \nINT. THE GUARDS' STATION \n", "test1_id": 1272, "test2_input": "HAWK You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof. \nDARWIN Ah, the magic word... \nAlfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing the auction house, on a bare wall. \nThe Board members gush.  The Elderly Woman gives a thumbs-up. \nDARWIN It's veja du, Hawkhead.  Something you wish never happened.  We shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind the hidden cameras. Hired the guy who did the last Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Excellent work... whoops, damn Fotomat assholes... \nA slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked out in leather.  He clicks ahead... \nHawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads-- THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT. \nMinerva leans over in front of him. \nMINERVA Tomorrow, you're going to hit a church. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY \nThe Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in on the Mayflower limousine circling around it. \nINT. THE LIMOUSINE \nHawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine in stylish Italian sunglasses. \nHAWK I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end up doing this... \nTwo identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle finger. \nINT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM \nMentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural. \nINT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM \nHawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope performing a Coronation. \nHAWK (half-hearted) Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed into robbing the Vatican by a psychotic American corporation along with a CIA... \nVATICAN GUARD \"You're being\".....uh, I don't, uh... \nA jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back. \nHAWK Forget it, man.  Go tackle a jaywalker. \nINT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY \nHawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking for Flunkies, he rips one up. \nHAWK Operator, I want to make a collect call to Alex Messina, New York.... \nThe Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes off. \nINT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM \nHawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles. \nINSIDE THE CODEX ROOM \nHawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details, of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair- cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and the object of their gaze... \nTHE DA VINCI CODEX \n--an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE. \nThe case is located between two informational tablets enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme. \nANNA (V.O.) But it is his gift as an inventor who drew together science and art that is most incredible. \nHawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick verbal breath and a hand squeeze. \n", "test2_true": "HAWK (vegetable) Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too... \nShe laughs, going into her public voice. \nANNA As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more. \nHAWK (under his breath) That's what you theenk. \nANNA Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank. \nA LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk, bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY. \nLITTLE BRAT This is so bor-ing!  Do you hate Italy as much as I do, Pokey? (bad ventriloquism) Si, senor!  Italy sucks the big one!  why can't we go to the Epcot Center! \nThe Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle from her side.  Hawk eyes the elephant strangely. \nANNA These more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that .... \nThe stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's head. \nThe ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage. \nStrange green gas comes billowing out of the vents. Needless to say, everyone goes crazy. \nCoughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the alarm off. \nTwo GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on. \nThe Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and spanked. \nLITTLE BRAT Pokey, come back! \nAnna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in around him.  The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap- lessly making their way up the opposite staircase. \nANNA Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond. \nHAWK Never, why do you ask? \nReaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door, Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS REALLY A DOOR.  The wall closes as the Flunkies come flying out, baffled. \nINT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE \nHawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark circular staircase. \nHAWK Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment... \nANNA Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo? \nHAWK Could you believe that crazy elephant? \nAnna shakes her head as she opens a door into... \nINT. A LITTLE UNDERGROUND SUBWAY--DAY \nA four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a mini-underground station.  Workers latch onto mail bags. Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door. \nHAWK Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square? \nANNA Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand.... \nHAWK The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained. \nANNA Nice.  But right out of our brochure. \nHAWK Oh, you read that. \nANNA Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people. \nHAWK You're not an unmysterious thang yourself. \nANNA I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls. (smoothing his jacket) And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring... \nHAWK God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians.... \n", "test2_id": 1273, "test3_input": "Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN. \nHAWK Catholic girls are scary... \nANNA Somebody robbed the Vatican. \nHAWK Oh.  No. \nAnna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat. She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out. They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  The Codex falls to the floor unharmed. \nHAWK It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is.... \nANNA You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex. \nHAWK Wha-- \nANNA What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower? \nEXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT \nCrammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of Hawk and Anna up in the window.  Snickers snaps a cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a goo-ey pastry. \nSNICKERS What's going on in there? \nBUTTERFINGER Do you want me to rape them? (throwing pastry down) Dunkin does it better. \nSNICKERS Just read, Butterfinger. \nButterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy. \nBUTTERFINGER \"Da Vinci had fears about his more dangerous designs, so he created a shorthand code in reverse script...\" \nALMOND JOY To yourself!.....What are they doing?  In twenty seconds, we go in. \nINT. ANNA'S PLACE \nFoam shoots out over the coffee.  Hawk smiles down at it as Anna works a cappuccino machine. \nANNA For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the \"gas leak\" that supposedly destroyed it. \nHAWK Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved! \nANNA The C.I. what?  God, no... \nHAWK (raising his cup) Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid... \nTHE CAR OUTSIDE \nThe agents burst from the car, guns raised. \nALMOND JOY Now. \nANNA'S HOUSE \nHawk sips the cappuccino.  His face immediately contracts. \nHAWK This doesn't taste like cappuccino. \nANNA Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it. \nAnna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her hand.  Hawk collapses.  His coffee cup lands perfectly in Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly on the pillow. \nThe candy bars bash the door open, guns raised. \nANNA Why didn't you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the Vatican tonight.  My people will not be happy.  I want to see Kaplan. \nALMOND JOY That's not overly possible.  He... \nBUTTERFINGER But guys, remember, he's in the castle at Vinci.... \nSnickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles. \nEXT. THE CASTLE--NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "INT. HELICOPTER \nAnna pets the head of Hawk on her lap.  She is pondering. \nINT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT \nA sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing Kaplan. \nSnickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair. \nKit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna.  She reacts as she comes into the light.  Kaplan takes the Codex from her. \nKAPLAN Way to go, Anna. \nANNA When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal... \nKAPLAN (gung-ho lying) And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it? \nHawk stirs.  The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V. \nANNA Actually George, it's not it. What are we doing in this castle? I happen to know the Mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do... \nThe lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the opening. \nKAPLAN (trying to be solemn) It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead. \nANNA (taking it in) Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some \"neat\" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool. \nKAPLAN Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat... \nKit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna. \nANNA Cat got his tongue? \nKAPLAN Actually he never told us what it was. \nKit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue. \nANNA How sweet.  I trust you will see Hudson Hawk is given to the proper authorities.  I recommend leniency... \nSNICKERS (holding in a laugh) Oh, I think we all do. \nHawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking Kit Kat. \nSNICKERS Do you think she has any idea that Operation Deflower Mayflower is as bogus as Kit Kat's tits? \nKAPLAN I don't think so, although bringing her to the castle gave her a big, juicy hint. \nALMOND JOY With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart? \nKAPLAN Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office.... \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT \nMoving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit Kat who fakes one back. \nINT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT \nKaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene.  In the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine. \nInside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos. \nAlso in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand. \nDARWIN Seven! \nMinerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster. Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead of an \"amused\" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat pants. \nALFRED Jolly.  Good.  Shot.  Sir. \nMINERVA Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease to amaze me, convict.  You are a terrible cat burglar! \nDARWIN Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out. \n", "test3_id": 1274}

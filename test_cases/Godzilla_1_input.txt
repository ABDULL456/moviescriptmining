MAJOR HICKS You gave them the tape? 
NICK No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it. 
Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick. 
GENERAL ANDERSON Pack your stuff. You're officially off this project as of now. 
120  INT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                120 
Caiman is still on television, wrapping up. 
AUDREY He stole my report! That's my report! 
ANIMAL We know, Audrey. 
CAIMAN (filtered) ...and in this reporter's opinion, "all the kings horses and all the kings men"... 
Audrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t.v. 
AUDREY Caiman you suck! 
121  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MORNING                 121 
The television is snapped OFF and Raymond walks over to the window looking out, thinking. Finally... 
RAYMOND We're leaving. 
CUT TO: 
A LARGE TRUNK 
Slams shut. More suitcases and trunks. Widen to reveal... 
122  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - DAY                             122 
Nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his things away. Elsie enters. 
ELSIE I'm sorry about all this. 
NICK Me too. 
Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave. 
NICK Make sure they find that nest before it's too late. 
ELSIE I'll try. 
Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey laying on the floor. 
ELSIE Bye worm guy. 
CUT TO: 
123  INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER - RAIN - DAY              123 
Audrey in a street phone booth. 
AUDREY What do you mean Murray's not there? A second ago you told me he was on the other line... 
Something catches Audrey's eye. 
AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK 
Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a waiting cab. 
124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124 
Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's trunk. 
CABBY Where to? 
NICK Newark airport. 
Audrey moves up behind Nick. 
AUDREY You're leaving? Why? 
Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab. 
AUDREY Is this cause of me? Because of the story? 
NICK Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? 
AUDREY You never said it was off the record. 
NICK I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. 
AUDREY I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. (confessing) Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. 
NICK So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? 
The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He stops and turns back to her. 
NICK Good luck in your new career. I think you really have what it takes. 
He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving a very alone Audrey standing in the rain. 
AUDREY (sad; to herself) I'm sorry.

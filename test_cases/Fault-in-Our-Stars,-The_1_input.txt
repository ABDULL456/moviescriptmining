PATRICK And how are you feeling Augustus? 
GUS Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend. Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away. 
PATRICK Perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, Augustus. 
GUS My fears? Gus thinks about this. 
GUS Oblivion. 
PATRICK Oblivion? ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued. 
GUS Yeah, see... I intend to live an extraordinary life. To be remembered. If I'm scared of anything it's... not doing that. Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that. 
PATRICK Would, uh, anyone like to speak to that? And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that. 
PATRICK Hazel! That's unexpected. Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus watches her, waits for it. 
HAZEL I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead. Gus is now even more fixed on her than before. 
HAZEL It might be tomorrow. Might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us, right? The look on Gus's face is unreadable. 
HAZEL Oblivion's inevitable. And if that scares you, well, I suggest you ignore it. God knows it's what everyone else does. A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO: 
EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear. Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between kisses, we can hear: 
ISAAC MONICA Always. Always. 
And Hazel hears: 
GUS Literally. Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her. 
GUS I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of Jesus. Hazel smiles. 
HAZEL Someone should probably tell him, don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart. Gus laughs. 
GUS What's your name? 
HAZEL Hazel. 
GUS No your full name? 
HAZEL 
(CONFUSED) Hazel Grace Lancaster. Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her. 
HAZEL What? 
GUS I didn't say anything. 
HAZEL Why are you looking at me like that? 
GUS Because you're beautiful. Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before. 
GUS I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon. 
HAZEL 
(BEAT) I'm not beaut -- A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them. 
YOUNG GIRL Hey Gus. 
GUS Hey Alisa. Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at each other. She hears: 
ISAAC MONICA Always. Always. 
HAZEL What's with the "always?" 
GUS "Always" is their thing. They'll "always" love each other and whatnot. Must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year. They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

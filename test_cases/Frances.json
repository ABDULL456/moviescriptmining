Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world. \nREPORTER #2 Better than any American company? \nREPORTER #1 What do you think of Stalin? \nFRANCES Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski. \nREPORTER #2 Who? \nLILLIAN (suddenly frantic, loud) Help me save my daughter! Save the children of America. \nA TALL SPECTRAL MAN dressed in black adds: \nTALL SPECTRAL MAN Repent, Frances, Repent! \nCROWD Repent! Repent! \nTheir cries seem weird, almost deranged, and Lillian is taken aback. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAY \nPassengers climb onto the bus. As Frances is hugged by her Drama Teacher, the Tall Spectral Man approaches her. In his arms he carries a potted plant, a Bible, and a flashlight. \nTALL SPECTRAL MAN Bless you, sister, bless you. (dignified, as though conducting some bizarre ceremony) Here is a Bible for solace... and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us... and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest Russia. \nFrances accepts the gifts, bewildered. The Tall Spectral Man stares at her through hollow eyes. She staggers on toward the bus, looking like a bedraggled Statue of Liberty. The Tall Spectral Man sings an ethereal hymn. \nLillian blocks Frances' path. Frances looks at her tearfully. \nFRANCES I love you, Mama. (turns to her father) I love you, Dad. \nERNEST (hugging her) Be careful, Francie. \nAs Frances climbs on board. \nLILLIAN Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna throw myself beneath the wheels. I'll do it, Frances. Frances! \nInside the bus, Frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly. \nThe bus starts. Everyone looks at Lillian. She is motionless... Furious. Frances sighs, and the bus moves off unimpeded. \nThere is a homicidal rage in Lillian's eyes as she stares after the vehicle. Then the Reporters rush toward her. \nFIRST REPORTER What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer? \nShe looks down, her lip quivering. Humiliated, crumbling... \nAs the reporters shout unanswered questions, Ernest puts his arm around his wife and leads her away. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nINT. FARMER STUDY - DAY \nLillian is happily thumbing through her scrapbook. Her hand runs down the page, and we SEE a series of headlines, with photos: \nMOTHER UNABLE TO HALT GIRL'S TRIP TO RUSSIA \n(Photo Lillian & Frances) \nThen: \nMOTHER WARNS AGAINST REDS IN SCHOOLS \n(Photo Lillian) \nNext is a SNAPSHOT of Frances on board on ocean liner. \nThen TWO SNAPSHOTS of her in what is clearly Moscow. She wears a Russian hat. The Kremlin stands behind her. \nThen SNAPSHOTS of her in New York, with a small clipping from the \"New York Times\": \nVisits Moscow Art Theatre... \nYOUNG ACTRESS RETURNS FROM RUSSIA, ASPIRES TO THE BROADWAY STAGE \nBelow this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad. Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her. \nLillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite -- blank -- page of her scrapbook. A handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her. She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. The clipping says: \"STARS OF TOMORROW\" and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars. \nLillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nWe SEE the Hollywood sign in the distance... then CHANGE FOCUS to see the front of the studio... \nINT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nFrances' hair is tightly curled. She is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool. Behind her TWO ASSISTANTS fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid. A seasoned PUBLICIST kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, CLAIRE, surveys the scene. \n", "test1_true": "Frances stares dramatically off into space. \nPUBLICIST Hobbies? \nThe camera clicks. \nFRANCES Oh, I swim some... play the piano badly... and I read like a fiend: I like history. \nPUBLICIST No, no, people don't want that. Now listen: you spend lots of time at the beach. You're crazy about dancing. And you're the kind of girl who's just a little in love with love. Get it? Now try again? Hobbies? \nFRANCES Look, I... \nPUBLICIST (writing in notepad) Beach... dancing... in love with love. \nFRANCES (ironically) That's me. \nThe camera clicks again. MR. BEBE -- a tall, brooding, well- dressed man -- ENTERS. \nCLAIRE Good morning, Mr. Bebe! \nBEBE Who's this? \nCLAIRE Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option. \nBEBE (an assessment) Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more? \nCLAIRE I guess so, sir. \nBEBE (nods, stares again at Frances) Very fine bone structure. \nHe leaves. Claire stares after him with profound contempt. \nPUBLICIST (coming up to Claire) Not much to work with. How's this: (reading) 'The most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to Hollywood was 12,000 miles long. After winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to Europe...' She made some deal with the Commies and went to Moscow, but I'm not going to say that, am I? \nCLAIRE Heavens no. Go on. \nPUBLICIST Um... 'Miss Farmer returned to New York City and had a brief fling with the Broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom.' \nCLAIRE 'Brief fling?' \nPUBLICIST Well, actually she couldn't get hired, but lucky for her, some guy in our New York office saw her. She says soon as she gets a stake, she's going back. \nClaire rolls her eyes. She's heard this before. \nThe Camera clicks again. Frances is frozen in time. \nINT. STUDIO ACTING CLASS - DAY \nTWO STUDENTS are doing a scene from \"Design For Living.\" Others sit around watching, whispering, flirting, sleeping... but Frances is paying very close attention, making notes. The MAN next to her rubs her arm and whispers something. She grimaces and pays no attention. Then she notices, two rows in front, a young handsome student, DICK, who's also making notes. She stares at him for a second, then back at the stage. \nEXT. LAUREL CANYON COTTAGE - DAY \nA tiny rustic cottage, dogs everywhere. Two identical old Fords are parked out front. \nINT. COTTAGE - DAY \nFrances sits on the couch talking on the phone. \nFRANCES Did you get the check?... Oh my God, it opened?!, what'd you think? \nWater lands on her face. She grimaces playfully. \nFRANCES Well, I hope I get bigger parts, they don't come much smaller. \nThe last line is garbled as water streams in her mouth. She fumbles for something on the floor. \nFRANCES No, I'm fine. I just have water in my mouth. \nShe finds a water pistol on the floor, picks up the phone, and starts searching for her assailant. \nFRANCES No, Mama, I'm not changing my name. They can't actually make you, you know? Most people don't realize that. (playfully, covering receiver) Oh Dick... \nShe flings open the bathroom door and finds him: Dick from drama class. A furious water battle ensues. \nFRANCES No, no, nothing's going on. (fast) I love you too, Mama. Give my love to Dad. Bye! \nShe hangs up, lowers her gun as Dick squirts her. She's getting wet. Her shirt clinging to her breasts. She likes it. \nFRANCES Okay, handsome. You win. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD SCREENING ROOM \nOn the small screen we SEE Frances in the arms of a MAN IN FIRE CHIEF'S HAT. \nFRANCES Kurt! \nFIRE CHIEF Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain... \nFRANCES But, Kurt, I... \nFIRE CHIEF No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do! \nFRANCES Oh, Kurt! \nFIRE CHIEF Oh Angela, my own... Angela! \n", "test1_id": 2340, "test2_input": "ON SCREEN the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent. The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers. The brim of his hat hits her forehead. Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing. The Fire Chief looks stunned. She tries to control herself. \nFRANCES I'm sorry... (looking into camera) I'm sorry, let's go back. \nLaughter inside the screening room. A small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly SEE TWO MEN. \nMAN #1 (irate) What the hell is that? What's she doing? \nLAUGHING MAN That's talent, Andy. \nMAN #1 (after a beat) Oh. \nEXT. CATWALK - DAY \nFrances smiles and eases shut the screening room door. We HEAR the Laughing Man inside shout: \"Let's see that again!\" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match. \nA man's hand appears, holding a lighter. She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat. \nFRANCES Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person! \nFrances throws her arms around him. They hug warmly. \nHARRY How ya doin', Farmer? \nFRANCES Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? \nHARRY Came to get a tan. \nThey compare forearms. \nFRANCES Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? \nHARRY (staring out) Kaminski. \nFRANCES Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. \nHARRY Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. \nFRANCES What? \nHARRY They killed him. They threw him out that window. \nFRANCES Oh no... \nHARRY Eight stories. \nShe stares down two stories to the ground, imagining: \nFRANCES Jesus. \nHARRY (also staring down) Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die. \nFRANCES (walking on) But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it? \nHARRY (shrugs) He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. (brightening) Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. (confidentially) I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. (turns around, displaying his shirt) How d'ya like the camouflage? \nFRANCES You jackass! (pushing him down the stairs) C'mon, let's get out of here. \nEXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY \nHarry and Frances walking arm in arm. \nFRANCES Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now. \nHARRY I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability. \nFRANCES (smiling) I know what ability you're interested in. \nHARRY Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. (off her sober expression) For old time's sake. \nFRANCES (serious) Harry... I met someone. \nHARRY (stiffens slightly) Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? \nFrances shakes her head. \nHARRY Actor? \nShe nods. \nHARRY Good. Then it's temporary. (whispers) All actors are phonies. \nHe's joking, but she doesn't respond. \nHARRY Serious, huh? \nFRANCES Yeah. \nHARRY Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. \nShe smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment. She squeezes his arm and they continue walking. \nINT. SOUND STAGE - SET (RHYTHM ON THE RANGE) - DAY \nLights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking. In the midst of this we SEE Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the WARDROBE MISTRESS, who is listening without enthusiasm. \n", "test2_true": "WARDROBE MISTRESS (cool) This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer. \nFRANCES (friendly) Oh, I know that. But it could look more realistic, don't you think? \nWARDROBE MISTRESS (looking her over) It'll do. No one will notice. \nFRANCES I'll notice. \nWe HEAR a man conspicuously clearing his throat. Both women turn as Mr. Bebe steps forward. \nWARDROBE MISTRESS Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning. \nHe nods imperceptibly. \nBEBE Come along with me, Fanny. \nShe hesitates, then goes. \nFRANCES That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook. \nBEBE (leading her off) You see: We've got to change that name. \nEXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY \nFrances and Bebe come through the sound stage door into the light. He gestures to indicate what direction they're going, but remains silent, watching her. She's uncomfortable, blinking like a bird. \nBEBE I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich -- \nFRANCES Thank you -- \nBEBE I intend to make a great deal of money off you. \nFrances is taken aback. This is all rather blunt. \nBEBE Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called \"Come and Get It.\" \nFRANCES Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific -- \nBEBE Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude. \nThey hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look: PICKETERS are fighting with POLICE. It is raucous, brutal. Bebe turns back to her with a stern look: \nBEBE Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I? \nFRANCES But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe. \nBEBE (fierce but very muted) No, I'm concerned with everything. \nFRANCES But I'm the one up there on the screen. \nBEBE That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act. \nShe's about to reply, but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips. Kisses it very formally, like a suitor. Then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building. \nShe watches him go. \nFADE OUT: \nOMITTED \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THEATRE MARQUEE - NIGHT \nBrightly colored bulbs flashing, causing the wisps of fog around them to glow. The bulbs spell: \n\"COME AND GET IT\" WITH SEATTLE'S OWN FRANCES FARMER \nA noisy CROWD is gathered outside the theatre, straining against velvet cordons. Big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear, to the applause of the crowd. All slightly small-town, off-key. \nHarry, now sporting a mustache, hat pulled down over his face, stands across the street. \nHARRY (puffing his cigarette) Not bad, Farmer. \nEXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nTwo limousines streaking through the night. \nINT. SECOND LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nFrances sits next to a faceless STUDIO EXECUTIVE. She's all dolled up. She looks uncomfortable. Silence. She glances up at the limo ahead of them. \nINT. FIRST LIMOUSINE - NIGHT \nDick sits between Lillian and Ernest A REPORTER and PHOTOGRAPHER crouch in front of them. \nLILLIAN I guess it's no secret that I'm proud. Only twenty-one years old, and look at all she's done. (confidentially) As for her looks, I flatter myself that she gets them from me. \nDICK Obviously. \nHe winks at the reporters. \nLILLIAN And not only has Frances come home a star; she's also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law! \nREPORTER Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction when Frances told you she had married... \n", "test2_id": 2341, "test3_input": "FRANCES Don't touch me! \nShe leaps out of the car. The Cop turns off the car lights. As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights. \nCOP Hey! \nHe runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way. When he catches her, he grabs her arm. She struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt. She switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. He lunges for it, knocks her down. They struggle. He rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff her. She writhes, knees him in the balls. She crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones. The Cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. The Cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. He pulls out his radio mike. \nCOP (panting) Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six. I got a live one here. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nOMITTED \nEXT. BEACH HOUSE BALCONY - DAY \nCLOSE ON front page of the Los Angeles Times, October 1942. The headlines read: \"24 Jap Ships Sunk\", \"Errol Flynn Sex Trial Delayed\", \"Frances Farmer Arrested on Drunk Driving Charge -- Actress Gets $250 Fine and Six Months Probation.\" \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of Frances' beach house. As the papers ruffle in the wind, a little kitten swipes at them. \nFrances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one we saw at the opening of the film. A man's shoes COME INTO VIEW. \nHARRY (O.S.) Got any ginger beer? \nShe turns, surprised and pleased to see him. \nFRANCES Take a look. \nHe walks off into the kitchen. She puts her diary away. \nFRANCES (calling) How the hell do you find me anyway? \nHARRY (O.S.) Animal magnetism! (she laughs) No ginger beer. What's this red stuff? \nFRANCES What's left of my blood. \nHARRY (O.S.) Think I'll have a glass. \nFRANCES Help yourself. Everyone else has. \nHarry returns, sipping the drink. \nHARRY Very tasty. \nShe smiles. \nHARRY (looking around) Nice joint. Can you afford it? \nFRANCES Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry. \nHARRY What for? \nFRANCES For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter. \nHARRY Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it. \nShe laughs. \nHARRY Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops. \nFRANCES I took the early rounds. \nHARRY (laughs) I'll bet. \nFRANCES I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt. \nHARRY So you drink, and you fight with a cop...? \nFRANCES Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really? \nHARRY Beats me. \nBeat. \nFRANCES I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out of this town. \nWe see a thought come to him. \nHARRY Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days? \nFRANCES No, Harry, I can't -- (right now) \nHARRY You're coming. \nOMITTED \nINT. SAN DIEGO BAR - NIGHT \nWaterfront bar, full of SAILORS, WHORES, and HEAVY DRINKERS. Hanging over the bar is San Diego paraphernalia. \nFrances and Harry sit at a table. Heavy boozing has led to philosophizing: \nFRANCES You know... when I started acting, you know what I wanted? \n", "test3_true": "FRANCES I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good. \nHARRY And? \nFRANCES Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze. \nIn the background, we SEE a DRUNKEN SAILOR lurching toward their table. \nHARRY Well, like the man said: \"You can make a fresh start with your last breath.\" \nThe Sailor trips and falls across their table, spilling beer on Frances and knocking things over. \nFRANCES (irritated) Hey, watch it. \nSAILOR (eyeing her suggestively) Watch what? \nFRANCES Get away from me, you foul slime. \nSAILOR That's no way for a lady to talk. \nHARRY Take a walk, pal. \nFRANCES Who said I was a lady? \nSAILOR Sorry I insulted you... bitch. \nHARRY Hey! \nFRANCES Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat. \nThe Sailor goes berserk, takes a swing at Frances. Harry leaps in to protect her, starts to fight with the Sailor. Frances joins in; she's not going to let anyone fight her battles. The Sailor's BUDDY enters the fracas. Everyone's getting hit. As the melee continues we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FRANCES' BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nA cab pulls up. Frances gets out. She looks weary and has a bruise on her cheek. A car is parked in the driveway. She frowns at it, shrugs, and carries her suitcase toward the house. \nINT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nShe enters with her bags, then drops them, stunned. The house is stripped bare. A MAN holding a measuring tape comes out of the bedroom. \nFRANCES What happened? Who're you? \nMAN Who're you? \nFRANCES I live here. \nMAN You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think. \nFRANCES What? \nMAN I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow. \nFrances stares at him, dumbfounded. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY \nFrances on the phone. Boxes spread out, their contents strewn over the floor, tables, etc. Frances is going through various piles, again and again, looking for something... \nFRANCES (muttering) God damn it, god damn it... (into phone) Yes, I'll wait, I'm waiting... (to herself) I don't believe this. They can't do this to me! \nShe takes a long drink, sifts through a pile, then throws it on the bed in disgust. We HEAR a voice on the phone. \nFRANCES (into phone) Barnes? It's my diary! They stole my fucking diary! Find it, will you? Find it! God damn it, that's my life! \nShe slams down the phone. \nINT. STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY \nThe crew is idle and the Director paces, muttering: \nDIRECTOR Never. Never again. I swear, I swear I will never work with this broad -- \nFrances, looking pretty hung-over, enters blithely. \nDIRECTOR You're four hours late! It's insane! It's unprofessional! \nFRANCES I'd say I'm behaving as professionally as anyone else in this town. \nDIRECTOR Where were you?! \nFRANCES Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept. What's the name of this fine entertainment we're all so involved in? \nThe Director clenches his fists as though about to punch her. \nFRANCES (looking blearly at the slate) Oh yes. \"No Escape.\" That's it. There's no escape. \nShe walks to her dressing room as the Director explodes anew. \nINT. FRANCES' DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nSmall, cramped; not like the earlier one we saw. The Hairdresser -- whom we recognize as Tora, the woman who cut Bebe's hair -- stands waiting, holding her brushes and looking vexed. Frances enters. \n", "test3_id": 2342}

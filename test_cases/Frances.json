{"train": "FRANCES \nWritten by \nEric Bergren, Christopher De Vore & Nicholas Kazan \nPROLOGUE \nBLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer. \nFRANCES (V.O.) No one ever came up to me and said, 'You're a fool. There isn't such a thing as God. Somebody's been stuffing you.' \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PUGET SOUND - DAY \nOn an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. After a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. A girl's face breaks through. \nFRANCES (V.O.) It wasn't a murder. I think God just died of old age. And when I realized He wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right. \nThe girl, FRANCES, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of God's existence. She swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on West Point Beach. \nFRANCES (V.O.) And yet I began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. He watches over all his children.' That jumbled it all up for me. \nEXT. PUGET SOUND - LATER \nThe banks of Puget Sound, dotted with elm trees. Frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. Towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun. \nFRANCES (V.O.) But still sometimes I found that God was useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important. 'Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.' \nINT. FARMER HOME - FAMILY ROOM - EVENING \nFrances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. An older woman, LILLIAN FARMER, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. A small suitcase stands by the front door. \nFRANCES It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it. \nERNEST FARMER appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read. \nFRANCES But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always? \nErnest goes to Frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. She looks at him briefly, smiling slightly. \nERNEST Bye, baby. \nFRANCES See you next weekend, Dad. \nHe goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at Lillian. She doesn't look up. He leaves. \nFRANCES I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nFrances stands at a podium. Other STUDENTS and TEACHERS sit to either side of her on folding chairs. Above the proscenium is engraved: West Seattle High School. Below that a banner hangs: \"NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY COMPETITION, 1931.\" \nFRANCES I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was... nothingness. \nThe AUDIENCE consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. We SEE several shocked faces. Lillian is there also, smiling. Seated next to her is a distinguished-looking woman, ALMA STYLES. Ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried. \nFRANCES I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me. \nFrances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. There is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. Lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. In the back a WOMAN also stands. \nWOMAN You're going straight to hell, Frances Farmer! \nA stately man sitting next to her, her husband JUDGE BENJAMIN HILLIER, puts a restraining hand on her arm. The woman continues to glare at Frances. \nFrances stares back, dumbfounded. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. SEATTLE STREETS - DAY \nThe screen erupts into violence. A large unruly MOB skirmishes with POLICE in a cobblestoned square. On a truckbed addressing the crowd -- which carries placards reading: \"Organize Now!\", \"Workers of the World Unite!\", and \"Elect Kaminski!\" stands MARTONI KAMINSKI. By his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, HARRY YORK. \nKAMINSKI And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family? \nYORK & CROWD No! \nKAMINSKI Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? \nYORK & CROWD No! \nKAMINSKI Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? \nYORK & CROWD No! No! \nKAMINSKI Good! Because, Brothers, that's you! \nThe crowd cheers. Harry York gives Kaminski the thumbs-up sign as a banner unfurls: \"Today Seattle -- Tomorrow the World.\" \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nFRANCES And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress... (wipes away tears) Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying... (through her tears) In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait... We shall rest... (embraces him) We shall rest! \nCurtains close. AUDIENCE bursts into applause. \nAs the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we SEE in the audience: Lillian and Ernest, Lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging Ernest to clap harder. \nAnd in the back stands Harry York. \nHARRY (to himself) Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad. \nINT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - NIGHT \nA celebration in progress. Masks of Comedy and Tragedy hang on the walls. DRAMA STUDENTS lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily. Bing Crosby is on the record player, singing \"I've Got The World on a String.\" The Drama Teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students. \nDRAMA TEACHER Art is a constant struggle. Some of you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two... \nThe front door opens. Frances and Chet enter. \nDRAMA TEACHER On cue. \nThe young men rush over to congratulate her. Frances takes a mock bow. She laughs as people cheer. TWO GIRLS observe from the back. \nGIRL #1 I could really learn to hate her. \nGIRL #2 Stand in line. \nINT. UNIVERSITY READING ROOM - SEVERAL HOURS LATER \nThings have quieted down. The Drama Teacher has cornered Frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of \"Voice of Action.\" Frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor. \nDRAMA TEACHER This is the answer: a subscription drive to \"Voice of Action!\" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski! \nFRANCES But I'll never win that. \nDRAMA TEACHER Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York. \nFRANCES (intrigued) Really? \nDRAMA TEACHER New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage! \nFRANCES (flattered/embarrassed) Thank you. \nA door opens quietly and Harry slips in. He smiles at Frances, who disentangles herself from her teacher and rushes over. \nFRANCES Hi, Harry. Did you see the play? \nHARRY You think I'd miss it? \nFRANCES Well? What'd you think? \nHARRY (shrugs) I just wanted to see how you looked. \nFRANCES How'd I look? \nHARRY (teasing) Enh. \nFRANCES (smiling) Don't be a rat, Harry. \nHARRY You looked okay. (glances around) Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home? \nShe hesitates, looks around and sees Chet passed out, snoring in a chair. She takes Harry's arm. \nEXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT \nThe beach is very dark, but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old Chevrolet parked near the shore. \nFRANCES (V.O.) You really think so? \nINT. CHEVROLET - NIGHT \nFrances and Harry are sitting in the back seat. \nHARRY Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid. \nFRANCES I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive. \nHARRY Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it. \nFRANCES Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it... \nHARRY What? \nFRANCES Quietly. \nHARRY You're not the quiet type, Frances. \nThey are silent for a while. \nHARRY You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there. \nFRANCES What happened to him? \nHARRY He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines. \nHe grins ironically and Frances laughs. \nFRANCES I'm not a Communist. \nREPORTER #2 But Frances, you said -- \nFRANCES I said all countries are of cultural interest. Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world. \nREPORTER #2 Better than any American company? \nREPORTER #1 What do you think of Stalin? \nFRANCES Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski. \nREPORTER #2 Who? \nLILLIAN (suddenly frantic, loud) Help me save my daughter! Save the children of America. \nA TALL SPECTRAL MAN dressed in black adds: \nTALL SPECTRAL MAN Repent, Frances, Repent! \nCROWD Repent! Repent! \nTheir cries seem weird, almost deranged, and Lillian is taken aback. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAY \nPassengers climb onto the bus. As Frances is hugged by her Drama Teacher, the Tall Spectral Man approaches her. In his arms he carries a potted plant, a Bible, and a flashlight. \nTALL SPECTRAL MAN Bless you, sister, bless you. (dignified, as though conducting some bizarre ceremony) Here is a Bible for solace... and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us... and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest Russia. \nFrances accepts the gifts, bewildered. The Tall Spectral Man stares at her through hollow eyes. She staggers on toward the bus, looking like a bedraggled Statue of Liberty. The Tall Spectral Man sings an ethereal hymn. \nLillian blocks Frances' path. Frances looks at her tearfully. \nFRANCES I love you, Mama. (turns to her father) I love you, Dad. \nERNEST (hugging her) Be careful, Francie. \nAs Frances climbs on board. \nLILLIAN Frances, I'm warning you. I'm gonna throw myself beneath the wheels. I'll do it, Frances. Frances! \nInside the bus, Frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly. \nThe bus starts. Everyone looks at Lillian. She is motionless... Furious. Frances sighs, and the bus moves off unimpeded. \nThere is a homicidal rage in Lillian's eyes as she stares after the vehicle. Then the Reporters rush toward her. \nFIRST REPORTER What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer? \nShe looks down, her lip quivering. Humiliated, crumbling... \nAs the reporters shout unanswered questions, Ernest puts his arm around his wife and leads her away. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFADE IN: \nINT. FARMER STUDY - DAY \nLillian is happily thumbing through her scrapbook. Her hand runs down the page, and we SEE a series of headlines, with photos: \nMOTHER UNABLE TO HALT GIRL'S TRIP TO RUSSIA \n(Photo Lillian & Frances) \nThen: \nMOTHER WARNS AGAINST REDS IN SCHOOLS \n(Photo Lillian) \nNext is a SNAPSHOT of Frances on board on ocean liner. \nThen TWO SNAPSHOTS of her in what is clearly Moscow. She wears a Russian hat. The Kremlin stands behind her. \nThen SNAPSHOTS of her in New York, with a small clipping from the \"New York Times\": \nVisits Moscow Art Theatre... \nYOUNG ACTRESS RETURNS FROM RUSSIA, ASPIRES TO THE BROADWAY STAGE \nBelow this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad. Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her. \nLillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite -- blank -- page of her scrapbook. A handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her. She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. The clipping says: \"STARS OF TOMORROW\" and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars. \nLillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nWe SEE the Hollywood sign in the distance... then CHANGE FOCUS to see the front of the studio... \nINT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nFrances' hair is tightly curled. She is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool. Behind her TWO ASSISTANTS fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid. A seasoned PUBLICIST kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup, CLAIRE, surveys the scene. \nON SCREEN the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent. The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers. The brim of his hat hits her forehead. Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing. The Fire Chief looks stunned. She tries to control herself. \nFRANCES I'm sorry... (looking into camera) I'm sorry, let's go back. \nLaughter inside the screening room. A small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly SEE TWO MEN. \nMAN #1 (irate) What the hell is that? What's she doing? \nLAUGHING MAN That's talent, Andy. \nMAN #1 (after a beat) Oh. \nEXT. CATWALK - DAY \nFrances smiles and eases shut the screening room door. We HEAR the Laughing Man inside shout: \"Let's see that again!\" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match. \nA man's hand appears, holding a lighter. She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat. \nFRANCES Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person! \nFrances throws her arms around him. They hug warmly. \nHARRY How ya doin', Farmer? \nFRANCES Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? \nHARRY Came to get a tan. \nThey compare forearms. \nFRANCES Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? \nHARRY (staring out) Kaminski. \nFRANCES Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. \nHARRY Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. \nFRANCES What? \nHARRY They killed him. They threw him out that window. \nFRANCES Oh no... \nHARRY Eight stories. \nShe stares down two stories to the ground, imagining: \nFRANCES Jesus. \nHARRY (also staring down) Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die. \nFRANCES (walking on) But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it? \nHARRY (shrugs) He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. (brightening) Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. (confidentially) I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. (turns around, displaying his shirt) How d'ya like the camouflage? \nFRANCES You jackass! (pushing him down the stairs) C'mon, let's get out of here. \nEXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY \nHarry and Frances walking arm in arm. \nFRANCES Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now. \nHARRY I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability. \nFRANCES (smiling) I know what ability you're interested in. \nHARRY Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. (off her sober expression) For old time's sake. \nFRANCES (serious) Harry... I met someone. \nHARRY (stiffens slightly) Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? \nFrances shakes her head. \nHARRY Actor? \nShe nods. \nHARRY Good. Then it's temporary. (whispers) All actors are phonies. \nHe's joking, but she doesn't respond. \nHARRY Serious, huh? \nFRANCES Yeah. \nHARRY Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. \nShe smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment. She squeezes his arm and they continue walking. \nINT. SOUND STAGE - SET (RHYTHM ON THE RANGE) - DAY \nLights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking. In the midst of this we SEE Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the WARDROBE MISTRESS, who is listening without enthusiasm. \nDICK Dwayne. Dwayne Steele. \nERNEST What...? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of course. Richard... uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman. \nDick smiles and hugs them both. \nDICK Well, all I can say is: I feel like I've known these two for years! \nLILLIAN (girlishly) Oh, Dwayne! (overcome) This is like a fairy tale! \nThey're stopped at a light. Outside their window we SEE DERELICTS, casualties of the depression, huddled in the night. \nINT. FRANCES' LIMO - NIGHT \nShe's staring at the derelicts. We feel her sympathy for them. Almost like she'd rather be out there. A MAN WITH HOLLOW EYES shouts something at them. \nFRANCES What'd he say? \nShe rolls down her window. The Studio Executive beside her looks at her like she's crazy. \nSTUDIO EXECUTIVE (to Driver) Let's go. We'll be late. \nThe limousine lurches forward. Frances settles back in her seat, letting the night air sweep over her face. \nEXT. THEATRE - NIGHT \nThe two limos pull up, the second emptying first. As Frances gets out, the CROWD cheers wildly. She walks past them, eyes glazed. She doesn't see Harry, who is held back by cordons. Lillian is posing and signing autographs. In her tight, formal dress, Frances looks radiant but constricted. As she walks, voices assault her: \nLILLIAN There she is! \nREPORTER #1 (O.S.) How does it feel to be back in Seattle, Frances? \nFRANCES A little strange. \nWOMEN'S VOICES Isn't she gorgeous? \nSTUDIO EXECUTIVE (O.S.) This way. \nREPORTER #2 (O.S.) How's the movie, Frances? \nFRANCES It's okay. \nLILLIAN (O.S.) Smile, little sister, smile. \nFrances sees her mother smiling nervously. They have entered the: \nINT. LOBBY - NIGHT \nAgain there is a cordoned area in the center where Seattle luminaries are sipping champagne. Reporter #1 lurches forward: \nREPORTER #1 Can you make some statement about Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools -- \nFRANCES Well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn't luck was hard work. \nREPORTER #1 (disappointed) Oh. \nJudge Hillier's Wife, whom we recognize as the Woman who shouted at Frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a garish gown. She's holding a large key. \nJUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE Miss Farmer, I can't tell you how proud I am to meet you. \nShe embraces and kisses Frances, who's more than a little put off. After the kiss, she takes firm hold of Frances' hand and won't let go. Judge Hillier steps to his wife's side. Lillian also approaches. \nJUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration -- \nFRANCES Excuse me. \nJUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE (startled) Yes...? \nFRANCES Don't I know you? \nJUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE I don't believe so. \nFRANCES Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay. \nJUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE No, my dear. You must be mistaken. \nFRANCES (barely audible) Oh bullshit. \nJUDGE HILLIER I beg your pardon? \nFRANCES (to the dignitaries) Listen, I'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all. \nA hideous silence. Judge Hillier is fuming. His wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her. She shoves it into Frances' arms. \nFrances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the Studio Executive, who escorts her into the theatre. The crowd follows. Lillian is utterly mortified. \nEXT. THEATRE - NIGHT \nWe TRACK along the side of the theatre. An exit door is thrown open, and Frances storms out. As she does, she trips over an OLD INDIAN BEGGAR. She stops and looks at him. He peers up at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. A connection is made. All the anger drains out of her. She gives him money, several bills. He breaks into a wonderful crooked grin. She starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city. He stares at it, bewildered. \nShe strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley. The CHAUFFEURS are talking and smoking a cigarette. Her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo. As it pulls into the street, we see Harry drift back to the curb and stare after it. \nOMITTED \nEXT. WEST POINT BEACH - NIGHT \nCLAIRE Hi Frances, got a minute? \nFRANCES Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way. \nThey walk toward the dressing room. \nCLAIRE (nervous) Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes. \nFRANCES (bewildered) My clothes? \nCLAIRE Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car -- \nFRANCES It's a perfectly good car. It runs. \nCLAIRE Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously. \nFRANCES I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car. \nCLAIRE You know what I mean. \nFRANCES Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person! \nClaire is laughing. They go inside. \nINT. FRANCES' DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nPosh, fit for a star. Frances smiles at the MAKEUP MAN. \nFRANCES Morning, Eddie. \nAs Frances sits at the table and Eddie goes to work: \nCLAIRE That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies. \nFRANCES Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies. \nCLAIRE I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know? \nFRANCES I know. (imitating Bebe) 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...' \nCLAIRE (laughing) ...acts. I'll relay your message. \nINT. FRANCES AND DICK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT \nDick is talking on the phone in the living room. \nDICK Yes, of course she'll make a statement on women's rights. Call back tomorrow, okay? \nHe hangs up. Immediately the phone rings again. He stares at it wearily, then answers: \nDICK (pointedly) Dwayne Steele's residence. \nThrough the half-open door to the bedroom we see Frances dozing, an open script laid out beside her. \nDICK Yes. (confused) What...? (hurt) Yes. Yes, I'll tell her. \nHe hangs up. Stares off. Slowly enters the bedroom. \nFrances looks up. \nDICK You learn your lines? \nFRANCES (nods drowsily) Sort of. \nDICK There've been some calls. \nFRANCES Who? \nDICK Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name? \nFRANCES Claire? \nDICK Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh? \nFRANCES (apprehensively) Fired? \nDICK Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand. \nFrances looks stricken. \nDick presses on. \nDICK There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh? \nFRANCES ...Yes. \nDICK Without me. \nFRANCES (sighing) Showdown. \nDICK You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it? \nFRANCES Dick, we need some time apart -- \nDICK Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing. \nYOUNG MAN Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade? \nFRANCES Why, you... you little bastard! \nThe Young Man grins. \nYOUNG MAN Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be seeing you. \nHe begins to walk away. \nFRANCES Just one minute... \nYOUNG MAN (turning) You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me. \nHe is gone. \nOMITTED \nINT. WORKING CLASS BAR - NIGHT \nOdets sits at a table in back, drinking and writing in a notebook. Frances comes up to him. \nHe smiles, draws her to him for a hug. \nODETS How'd it go? \nShe hesitates, still affected by the incident outside the theatre. \nFRANCES 'But how do I know you love me?' \nODETS Your big speech? \nFRANCES 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, \"This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!\" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.' \nODETS (smiling) I already have. \nShe nods, turns her back to him. \nFRANCES How's it sound? \nODETS The speech? Real good. \nFRANCES You think I got it? \nODETS You got it. \nFRANCES Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it. \nShe is crying. \nOMITTED \nINT. ODETS' APARTMENT - DAY \nFrances comes in the front door with a bag of groceries, removes her key. Walks into the living room, stops short. Clurman is sitting on the couch, a bottle and two glasses in front of him. \nFRANCES Hello, Harold. \nCLURMAN (nodding) Frances. \nFRANCES (looking around) Where's Clifford? \nCLURMAN He's not here. \nFRANCES Oh. \nShe sits. \nCLURMAN Bourbon? \nHe pours. She drinks hers, watching him. \nFRANCES What's up? \nCLURMAN I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract. \nFRANCES That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London. \nCLURMAN Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London. \nFrances looks like she's been punched in the stomach. \nFRANCES (insecure) You don't think I'm good enough? \nCLURMAN What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it. \nFRANCES Who? \nCLURMAN An actress. \nFRANCES A rich actress. \nCLURMAN Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna. \nFRANCES (growing angry) But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people! \nSitting comfortably in a nearby director's chair is a DIRECTOR reading Daily Variety. The headline reads: \"STUDIO WINS FARMER WAR ON HOLLYWOOD.\" Behind the Director, off to one side, stands Bebe. The A.D. tugs on the Director's sleeve: \nA.D. How was that? \nDIRECTOR (looking up) Good, good. One more time. \nFRANCES (standing) For God's sake... why? \nDIRECTOR Because we want to get it perfect... just the right combination of fury and confusion. You can understand that, can't you, Miss Farmer? We're serious artists here, right? Right. \nThe Director glances toward Bebe, who nods with satisfaction. \nFrances watches this interaction. She hesitates, then approaches Bebe. She wipes some mud from her face and drops it at her feet. \nFRANCES Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it. \nBEBE (somewhat snidely) I'd like nothing better. \nShe turns and walks, with an air of pride, to her wardrobe trailer. \nEXT. ELEGANT BEACHFRONT HOME - NIGHT \nLights everywhere. Cars line the driveway. We HEAR the SOUND of a large party. \nA car pulls up. BOB BARNES gets out, goes around to open the door for Frances. She's exhausted. She doesn't move. \nBARNES Well... come on. \nFRANCES This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster. \nBARNES Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up! \nFRANCES (tiredly) But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change. \nBARNES Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh? \nFRANCES (getting out) You're right. I'm sorry. (sighs) Okay, let's go get 'em. \nBARNES (taking pills from pocket) Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off. \nFRANCES (joking) So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too? \nBARNES Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy. \nShe nods, takes a few. They head for the door. \nINT. HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT \nThe DOORBELL CHIMES. The hostess, CONNIE, a pleasant-looking woman, answers the door. \nBARNES Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell party! \nCONNIE (pleased) Frances! \nAs they embrace, Frances looks around with trepidation: \nFRANCES (whisper) God, who's here? \nCONNIE (also whispering) The usual vermin, I'm afraid. \nBarnes tries to pull Frances inside. \nShe sees a flurry of waiting faces. Everyone's watching her. \nFRANCES (sotto voice) Get me a drink. \nBarnes nods, concerned, and crosses to the bar. \nFRANCES Hi everybody. \nSome people seem amused, some curious, some scornful. The Director from the mud scene nods to her. Connie is at her side for support. A voice from somewhere pierces the chatter: \nSNIDE VOICE So nice to have you back, Frances. \nAs Barnes returns with her drink, she turns to Connie: \nFRANCES Connie, can I use the upstairs bathroom? \nCONNIE Sure. \nINT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLater. Frances lies in a bubblebath, relaxing, sipping her drink. She obviously feels a lot better. Someone knocks. \nFRANCES Come in. \nA FAT MAN ENTERS, stares at her. \nFRANCES (relaxed) Hi. \nHe is dumbfounded. He slowly retreats into the hall. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBarnes is talking to a Young Man whom we recognize as the reporter who tricked Frances in New York. \nFRANCES Don't touch me! \nShe leaps out of the car. The Cop turns off the car lights. As Frances passes his motorcycle, she switches on its lights. \nCOP Hey! \nHe runs after her, turning off the motorcycle lights on the way. When he catches her, he grabs her arm. She struggles, grabs the flashlight from his belt. She switches it on and holds it high, its beam spearing wildly out to sea. He lunges for it, knocks her down. They struggle. He rolls on top of her, pinning both her arms with one hand... trying to handcuff her. She writhes, knees him in the balls. She crawls away, desperately clawing at loose stones. The Cop, angry now, hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on. As they dig into her wrists, she tries to bite him. The Cop, winded from the battle, yanks her to her feet and drags her, kicking and screaming, to his motorcycle. He pulls out his radio mike. \nCOP (panting) Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six. I got a live one here. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nOMITTED \nEXT. BEACH HOUSE BALCONY - DAY \nCLOSE ON front page of the Los Angeles Times, October 1942. The headlines read: \"24 Jap Ships Sunk\", \"Errol Flynn Sex Trial Delayed\", \"Frances Farmer Arrested on Drunk Driving Charge -- Actress Gets $250 Fine and Six Months Probation.\" \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of Frances' beach house. As the papers ruffle in the wind, a little kitten swipes at them. \nFrances sits in the sun writing in her diary, the same one we saw at the opening of the film. A man's shoes COME INTO VIEW. \nHARRY (O.S.) Got any ginger beer? \nShe turns, surprised and pleased to see him. \nFRANCES Take a look. \nHe walks off into the kitchen. She puts her diary away. \nFRANCES (calling) How the hell do you find me anyway? \nHARRY (O.S.) Animal magnetism! (she laughs) No ginger beer. What's this red stuff? \nFRANCES What's left of my blood. \nHARRY (O.S.) Think I'll have a glass. \nFRANCES Help yourself. Everyone else has. \nHarry returns, sipping the drink. \nHARRY Very tasty. \nShe smiles. \nHARRY (looking around) Nice joint. Can you afford it? \nFRANCES Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry. \nHARRY What for? \nFRANCES For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter. \nHARRY Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it. \nShe laughs. \nHARRY Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops. \nFRANCES I took the early rounds. \nHARRY (laughs) I'll bet. \nFRANCES I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt. \nHARRY So you drink, and you fight with a cop...? \nFRANCES Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really? \nHARRY Beats me. \nBeat. \nFRANCES I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out of this town. \nWe see a thought come to him. \nHARRY Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days? \nFRANCES No, Harry, I can't -- (right now) \nHARRY You're coming. \nOMITTED \nINT. SAN DIEGO BAR - NIGHT \nWaterfront bar, full of SAILORS, WHORES, and HEAVY DRINKERS. Hanging over the bar is San Diego paraphernalia. \nFrances and Harry sit at a table. Heavy boozing has led to philosophizing: \nFRANCES You know... when I started acting, you know what I wanted? \nTORA It's about time! You're not the star on this show, y'know! \nFrances sits. Tora begins brushing her hair, yanking Frances' head back with each stroke. Building tension... \nTORA Of course, it's not up to me to say anything. I'm just crew... Y'know, you hair's so fine you'll lose it if you're not careful. Wonder you all don't, the things you do to yourselves. In fact, I think you are already... Fact, I think you better -- \nFrances cries out and twists around suddenly. Tora is thrown back: stumbling... falling... hitting her jaw against a chair. \nFRANCES That's it! I'm not taking this any more! I quit! \nShe storms out. Tora is left moaning, holding her jaw. \nINT. STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY \nFrances marches across it. Everyone stares. \nFRANCES Goodbye!... goodbye!... goodbye!... \nWhen she reaches the exit door, she turns and bows to them all, grandiloquently. \nINT. FRANCES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nShe's snoring in bed. Face down, spread-eagled. The light is on. A whiskey bottle (three-quarters empty), a tumbler (three- quarters full), and a bottle of pills sit on the night table. \nThe phone RINGS. She winces, groans, tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together: hung over. Her arm flails out, finds the light and turns it off. \nFRANCES Shit. \nThe phone keeps RINGING. Her arm gropes for it. \nA loud POUNDING at the door. \nFRANCES What the hell's going on here? (calls) Hold on! (answering phone) Hello... (we HEAR a dial tone) Hello? \nThe POUNDING at the door becomes violent. Someone's breaking it down. \nFRANCES Hey! \nThe door splinters. \nFRANCES What...? Help! \nMen stream into the room. Back-lit from the hall they look like monsters, phantoms. They're carrying sticks. \nFrances screams and runs naked into the bathroom. \nFRANCES Don't kill me! Don't kill me! \nShe slams the door on the advancing figures. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nFrances leans her weight against the door. \nFRANCES Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don't let them kill me! \nIt's too much for her. She's shoved back, falling to the floor. The door flies open revealing THREE LARGE COPS. Leering at her. Frances clutches at the shower curtain, trying to cover herself. \nCOP Get your clothes on. \nFRANCES (crying) You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here -- \nCOP Get your clothes on, lady -- \nFRANCES GET OUT! \nCOP You're under arrest. \nOMITTED \nINT. SANTA MONICA POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nFrances is being led to the booking desk. All around her Photographers snap her picture, and Reporters walk alongside subjecting her to a never-ending barrage of questions. Frances just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour-faced SERGEANT facing her. \nSERGEANT Name? \nFRANCES I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am! \nThe Photographers laugh. \nSERGEANT Age? \nFRANCES Fifteen. \nSERGEANT (bristling) Address? \nFRANCES Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch! \nSERGEANT Occupation? \nFrances considers for a moment, then smiles matter-of-factly. \nFRANCES Cocksucker. \nThe Sergeant reddens. Frances laughs as the Photographers snap their shots. \nThe Matron relaxes her grip and gives Frances a handkerchief. Frances dabs at her eyes... wraps the kerchief around her knuckles... and slugs the Matron in the jaw, sending her sprawling. Frances runs to the phones. \nREPORTER Oh my God, she's loose! \nFrances throws herself at the door of the booth. The Reporter is delirious with joy: what a story! \nREPORTER She's attacking your correspondent! Right here in the Court Building! Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone stop her! \nFrances pounds at the door a few more times, then moves to the next booth... into the arms of Harry. \nFRANCES (a whisper) Harry! \nHarry shakes his head. Before he can speak, Frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator. \nFRANCES I have a right! I have a right! \nREPORTER (into phone) With what must surely be the final act of madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer's once promising career. The crazed blonde who at \nHarry opens the door to his booth. The Reporter looks up at him. \nREPORTER Hold it a second, Bub... \nHarry says not a word, but punches the Reporter hard in the face. The Reporter sags, out like a light. In the confusion, no one has noticed a thing. Harry pulls the door shut. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nFrances is sitting in a wooden chair. The venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed. The room is dim and terribly quiet. A WOMAN is murmuring something to a kindly-looking JUDGE. Another MAN is standing beside her. Frances can't quite make out the words. \nWOMAN ...and we feel that this would be more appropriate. \nJUDGE ...a difficult decision, but, I'm sure, the proper one. \nHe nods to the other Man who, together with the Woman, turn away from the bench. As they pass in front of one of the tall windows, Frances recognizes the Woman. It is Alma Styles. \nFRANCES What? \nShe feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. Her mother's face appears by hers. \nLILLIAN (whispering) It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine. \nFRANCES Mama, what's... \nLILLIAN Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need. \nFRANCES You're taking me home! \nTwo other WOMEN appear at either side of Frances and Lillian. Lillian tenderly takes her daughter's face in her hands. \nLILLIAN (smiling) First things first, little sister. Trust me. \nShe kisses Frances on the forehead. Frances looks at the two Women. They are smiling understandingly at Lillian. Frances looks a little alarmed. \nOMITTED \nEXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY \nA wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a white-washed wall are black letters: \"MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME\". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene. \nThe car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees. \nINT. A SMALL OFFICE - DAY \nFrances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. Lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well-manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance. \nLILLIAN Why it's beautiful here! What a view! \nLillian smiles enthusiastically at Frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that. \nAn awkward moment of silence. Lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say. She is rescued when the door opens and DR. SYMINGTON (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters. He holds his right hand out to Frances. \nMAN Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr. Symington. \nFrances stares at the proffered hand. Lillian steps in quickly and takes it. \nLILLIAN Good afternoon, Doctor. \nThe Doctor winks at Frances and puts a hand on Lillian's arm. \nSYMINGTON I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here. \nHe smiles pleasantly. Lillian is obviously very put off by the idea. She looks at Frances who stares unseeingly out the window. \nLILLIAN Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're... \nSYMINGTON I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment. \nHe goes to the door and opens it. Lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces. She bends down and tightly hugs Frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times. \nLILLIAN I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl. \nShe waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door. \nFRANCES (staring out window) Mama! \nLillian turns back expectantly. \nThe Nurse smiles confidentially at her. \nNURSE Honey... take my word for it. This is a resort. \nThey get to the door and HEAR Lillian's protesting voice: \nLILLIAN (O.S.) You have no right! \nThey enter and SEE the Matron struggling to get Lillian's coat away from her. Lillian pleads with Frances. \nLILLIAN Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am! \nFRANCES Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart! \nFrances bursts out laughing. The Matron releases Lillian and comes for Frances. \nINT. FRANCES' ROOM - DAY CLOSE-UP OF A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE \nA little fluid squirts out the tip. \nFRANCES (O.S.) But what is it? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Frances strapped down on a white cot. The Nurse is holding the syringe while a THIN NURSE and an ATTENDANT stand by. \nFRANCES You've got to tell me what it is! \nTHIN NURSE It's insulin. It throws your body into shock. \nFrances looks at her suspiciously, uncertain whether to believe this, and turns toward the Nurse with the hypodermic. \nNURSE WITH HYPO (reassuringly) It's just vitamins. \nThis sounds more reasonable. Frances relaxes somewhat. \nNURSE WITH HYPO A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals... (inserting hypo) Just stay relaxed... Good, now open your mouth a sec. \nFrances does. The Attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth. Frances squirms, fights. The Attendant holds the bar in place. And the Nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo. Frances goes rigid. Her eyes widen, her back arches. With a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse. The SCREEN BEGINS TO FADE into bright white light. She is unconscious. The SCREEN IS NOW BLANK. \nEXT. COURTYARD - MEADOW WOOD - DAY \nFrances sits beside Lillian on a bench. Other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about. \nThere is an open carpet bag at Lillian's feet and, in her lap, a bundle of letters and telegrams that she's showing to Frances. Frances seems restless. \nLILLIAN ...and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time. \nShe hands it to Frances, who lets it drop beside her on the bench. \nLILLIAN And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that... \nFRANCES Why are these all opened? \nLILLIAN Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now. \nFRANCES Then why did you bring them? \nLILLIAN It's your fan mail, little sister. \nFRANCES (looking off, under her breath) You kill me, Mama. \nLILLIAN What? \nFRANCES Go on... \nFrances sighs. She looks for something to divert her attention. \nINT. SYMINGTON'S OFFICE - DAY \nFrances is alone in the room. The door is ajar. She's standing over Symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad. The doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic... After a moment, Symington ENTERS holding several folders. Frances' manner changes very subtly. \nSYMINGTON ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit? \nFRANCES (sitting) Yes. It was very good to see her. \nSYMINGTON Really? Any problems? \nSymington puts the folders in a drawer. All except Frances'. \nFRANCES Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. (a performance) I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake. \nSYMINGTON You're telling me you feel guilty. \nFRANCES (slightly edgy) No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all. \nSYMINGTON (after a pause) Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you? \nFRANCES (laughing) What? \nSYMINGTON She told me you said, \"Mama, you want to kill me.\" \nFRANCES I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said... \nSYMINGTON And you accused her of tampering with your mail. \nFRANCES Oh for Christ's... \nThe Attendants hold their ground. Harry runs after Frances. \nEXT. GROVE OF TREES - DAY \nFrances and Harry crash through bushes, come to a high wall. \nHARRY (offering to lift her) Here. \nFrances hugs him tightly, kisses him. He lifts her by the waist, and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up. Harry joins her. We SEE, over the wall, a Lincoln Zephyr waiting on a dirt road. Harry and Frances jump down as we HEAR the Two Attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up. As their heads pop over the top of the wall, they see the Lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust... \nINT. LINCOLN - DUSK - DAY \nHarry, eyes bleary and shoulders hunched, tries to concentrate on the road ahead. The RADIO DRONES quietly, a lazy saxophone ballad. After a while, there's movement in the back seat and Frances sits up. She yawns and stretches as Harry watches her in the mirror. \nHARRY Evening, gorgeous. \nFRANCES (yawning) That sure looks like fun... (leaning over front seat) You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel? \nHARRY Forget it, Frances. You're not driving. \nFRANCES Have I told you how mean you're turning, York? \nHarry smiles. Frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio. \nFRANCES Where are we, mean man? \nHARRY Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch. \nFRANCES I should've known... \nHARRY What? \nFRANCES This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone... \nHARRY That's right. \nFRANCES (smiling) ...Take advantage of me. \nHarry laughs. \nThey pass a poster: \"BUY WAR BONDS!\" Frances stares at it. \nFRANCES I don't think I'd be much good in a war... \nHARRY Whattaya think you're in now? \nFRANCES (sleepily) I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe... \nHARRY Huh? \nFRANCES A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers. \nHarry looks at her quizzically. \nHARRY Who to? \nBeat. \nFRANCES Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama. \nHARRY Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her. \nFRANCES (sitting up) No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all. \nHARRY Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that! \nShe rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften. \nShe looks at him fondly, thoughtfully. \nFRANCES You know something, Harry? \nHARRY I guess. \nFRANCES Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you. \nHARRY What's that? \nFRANCES You can't drink. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Lincoln is parked beside a few other cars. \nINT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT \nFrances and Harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses. The JUKEBOX PLAYS, a few COUPLES dance. Frances is gulping down a tall Scotch. \nFRANCES (wincing/grinning) Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch! \nHARRY (calling drunkenly) Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! \nFRANCES What a man! \nSTYLES Never mind. We won't have to worry about him much longer. \nEXT. LINCOLN - END OF FRANCES' STREET - DAY \nHarry pulls up at a stop sign. He rubs his forehead wearily as a car crosses the intersection. It stops dead in front of him. Another pulls up alongside. Another behind. Harry thinks about this. His hand slides down slowly under the seat. We SEE the handle of his ice pick. Harry turns to smile at the MAN in the next car. The Man flashes an FBI badge, points revolver: \nFBI MAN (smiling) How ya doin', Al? \nHARRY You got the wrong guy. Name's Slocum. \nFBI MAN No, it ain't. And it ain't Harry York, neither. \nHARRY Look, I'm tellin' you... \nThe FBI Man pulls the hammer back on the revolver. ANOTHER MAN opens the passenger door. \nFBI MAN I'd give you till ten, Al, but we ain't got the time. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nOMITTED \nINT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS \nJudge Hillier walking... out of the chamber and down a corridor. His stride is long, his demeanor purposeful. The corridor leads into a courtroom. Harry standing at attention. We hear Hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official. Harry stares up at the judge. \nHILLIER Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns, Thomas Slocum, Harry York... Mr. Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years. Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed -- inciting to riot -- and the cause you sought to promote -- a worker's rebellion -- are such anathemas to this court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. I only wish it were longer. (slamming gavel) Six months in the state penitentiary. \nINT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY \nFrances sits at the piano playing \"You Are My Sunshine\". Lillian is lounging on the couch, leafing happily through her scrapbook. \nLILLIAN Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet Afton'. \nFrances' brows mesh. \nFRANCES Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song. \nLILLIAN Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy. \nFrances sighs and begins to play it. Lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along. \nLILLIAN It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish... but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook. \nShe smiles warmly at Frances. Frances abruptly stops playing. \nFRANCES I think I need a little air. \nLILLIAN What's wrong? \nFRANCES Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile. \nLILLIAN Where are you going? \nFRANCES For a walk, Mama. Just a walk. \nShe gets up and Lillian rouses herself. \nLILLIAN How long will you be? \nFRANCES Not long. \nFrances goes down the hall for her coat. Lillian follows part way. \nLILLIAN (smiling) I'll have lunch ready by one. \nFRANCES I'll be back. \nLILLIAN At one. Promise? \nFRANCES Sure. \nFrances returns wearing the coat. Lillian half-blocking her path. \nLILLIAN Say you promise. \nFRANCES I promise I'll... I promise, Mama. \nLillian nods, moves aside. As Frances heads for the door: \nLILLIAN You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister. \nFRANCES (exiting) Yes, Mama. \nLILLIAN I don't want you drinking, Frances. \nFRANCES Yes, Mama. \nLillian enters and re-establishes herself on the couch with a happy smile. She begins to hum \"Flow Gently Sweet Afton\" \nINT. FLEA-BAG HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nDERELICTS sleep on broken couches and armchairs. In a corner by a pay phone Ernest Farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs. Frances sits across from him. They've been talking. \nFRANCES ...So what do you think? \nDR. DOYLE (bored) Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer -- \nALMA STYLES Frances has always been a battleground, Lillian. \nDR. DOYLE, a psychiatrist, and the others are seated with Judge Hillier around a table. \nDOYLE The point is: it's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse? \nLILLIAN Well... yes. \nDoyle fills in a line on the printed form before him. \nDOYLE And you feel you're unable to control her any longer? \nLILLIAN No... I mean, yes, Doctor. \nAlma holds up Lillian's bruised wrists as evidence. \nDOYLE And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution? \nLILLIAN Well, Alma told me that... \nAlma looks coolly at Lillian. \nLILLIAN ...Yes. \nHillier nods slightly, approvingly, toward Alma. \nDOYLE (closing his folder) I believe that's all I need to know about Miss Farmer. \nHILLIER I think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Richardson. \nLILLIAN Her married name? \nHILLIER Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum. \nLILLIAN ...Oh yes. \nHILLIER Now. Can you tell us where we might find Frances? \nINT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BAR - NIGHT \nIt's late. Frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted DRINKERS. \nFRANCES ...Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in -- the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.' \nBehind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain. In the street a police car cruises slowly past. \nFRANCES Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,... he's got the bar all to himself... Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street. RRRAAAAAAA!!! (stomping her feet) Gigantic footsteps... coming closer. Stopping. \nWe SEE the police car again... It stops out front. \nFRANCES Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror -- whiskey and glass flying everywhere. \nTWO COPS appear at the window, looking in. \nFRANCES He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!' \nEveryone laughs. A long moment of enjoyment. Then Frances turns, looks out the window and sees the cops. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHillier behind the bench. Doyle sits at a table with Alma Styles. A COURT RECORDER taps out his notes in an odd, jerky style. (NOTE: This scene is INTERCUT, where appropriate, with shots of FRANCES in a bare room, wearing a strait jacket.) \nDOYLE ...From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care. \nHILLIER (to Styles) Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury trial? \nSTYLES Yes, your Honor. \nShe signs a paper which is passed to Hillier. \nHILLIER Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician... and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician, I do hereby order that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson, an insane person, be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom. \nHe bangs his gavel. \nHILLIER So ordered! Are the gentlemen from Steilacoom present? \nEXT. STEILACOOM - DAY \nHuge, dark-red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees. A van pulls up to the front entrance. Two MEN get out, open the back doors and assist Frances out. She is strapped into a strait-jacket. She yells and struggles violently but a piercing SCREAM stops her. She looks up at the building. \nFrom a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves \"hello\". \nINT. STEILACOOM HALLWAY - DAY \nFrances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum-covered hallway. There are many patients here, talking to imaginary birds, laughing at unheard jokes. A few of them notice Frances, most do not. The two Orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open. A bare 6'\u00d710' room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows. Frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click. \nINT. TREATMENT ROOM - DAY \nA MEDICAL STUDENT wheels a small electrical machine up to a table. On the table Frances is securely strapped down. TWO DOCTORS grease Frances' temples and put two metal electrodes on them. The electrodes are connected to the machine. \nDOCTOR #1 What's she getting, anyway? \nDOCTOR #2 Standard series to start. \nShe glances across at the Hitchhiker and nods casually. He responds in kind. A relaxed silence follows. Two strangers passing. His voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm: \nHITCHHIKER Pretty morning. \nFRANCES (nods) It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful... \nHITCHHIKER And no people. \nFRANCES Yes. \nBeat. \nHITCHHIKER Where you goin'? \nFRANCES Wherever they're going, I'm going. \nHITCHHIKER Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been? \nFRANCES Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until... \nShe stops. She sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car. She averts her face... then tries to hide her gesture. \nHITCHHIKER What's the matter? \nFrances sighs as the cop car speeds away. \nHITCHHIKER They're looking for you, huh? \nShe's uncertain whether to trust him. Takes the plunge: \nFRANCES Yeah. \nHITCHHIKER What'd you do? \nFRANCES You know, I've never been able to figure that out. \nHe laughs. She shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her. He takes out a small flask and offers, no strings: \nHITCHHIKER I've got a little whiskey here, warm you up. \nShe smiles, truly grateful: \nFRANCES Thank you. \nThen she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side. \nFRANCES Wait. Maybe they'll pick you up. \nThe car stops. Its lights flashing. COPS jump out. \nFRANCES Shit! \nHITCHHIKER Run! \nShe does. She's pursued. The Hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the Cops' progress, but is tossed aside. The Cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her. \nEXT. SMALL TOWN JAIL - DAY \nFrances and Ernest walk out the door followed by a portly SHERIFF. He watches them get in Ernest's car and drive off. His expression says very clearly: I'm glad that's over with. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nErnest's at the wheel, Frances at his side. Silence, then: \nFRANCES Dad...? Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out? \nErnest writhes slightly with discomfort. \nERNEST Francie, you know I can't do that. \nFRANCES Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again. \nERNEST They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know. \nWe SEE them approaching a side road. \nFRANCES Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you. \nERNEST But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied. \nThey are nearer the side road. \nFRANCES You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please? \nERNEST Please, Francie... \nFRANCES (pleading) Daddy! \nThey pass the side road. It disappears behind them. All the life seems to drain from Frances. \nERNEST I'll try to protect you, Francie. I will, I'll talk to her. We'll have a real talk. \nFrances buries her face in her hands. \nERNEST Are you... are you hungry? \nShe is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice: \nDR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) One merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain. \nThe lights are bright, on her and the other patients. We cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching. \nDR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) Because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour. \nFrances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. It's moving round and round. The voice drones on. \nDR. HARLINGTON (O.S.) The operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever. \nWe now see vaguely that DR. HARLINGTON has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney. \nDR. HARLINGTON We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty. \nFrances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice-pick-like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket... \nDR. HARLINGTON This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment. \nThe leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted. \nDR. HARLINGTON In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening... \nFrances turns away and stares at the fan again. There is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring... \nDR. HARLINGTON ...with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed. \nWe glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn. \nDR. HARLINGTON These patients will soon be leaving the hospital. \nHarlington's face moves vaguely into Frances' view. \nDR. HARLINGTON Lobotomy gets 'em home. \nHe moves directly over Frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. As the leucotome descends, we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY \nTotal disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... This house is easing slowly back to nature... \nINT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nNeglect is just as evident inside. Dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. Lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. She has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. The scrapbook is open on her lap. \nLILLIAN What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances. \nErnest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. FOUR REPORTERS crouch on the floor, totally bored. Yesterday's headlines are now old news. \nLILLIAN They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart... \nTwo Reporters rise and edge toward the door. \nREPORTER Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to... uh... \nTHIRD REPORTER (rising) Yeah, I better pack it in too. \nLILLIAN (distractedly) Pardon? Oh, would you like more lemonade? \nThe last Reporter gets to his feet. \nFOURTH REPORTER (kindly) I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye. \nHe follows the others out. Lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. Ernest stares into the fire. \nLILLIAN You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day. \nErnest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. He knows damn well Frances isn't coming home... \nFADE IN ON: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark background The show is \"This Is Your Life\". We SEE a smiling RALPH EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances. She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems uncomfortable. \nEDWARDS ...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you. \nThroughout this, Frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt. \nEDWARDS ...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances? \nFRANCES ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... \nWe MOVE AWAY from the screen to see that the TV set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. On the couch in front of the set sits Harry York. He still looks athletic, young for his age. Tears stream down his cheeks. \nEDWARDS (O.S.) Were you an alcoholic? \nFRANCES (O.S.) No. \nEDWARDS (O.S.) Were you a drug addict? \nFRANCES (O.S.) No. Never. \nON THE SCREEN Edwards has moved Frances over to a seating area where various people from Frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. We've never seen any of them before. \nEDWARDS ...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail! (indicating seating area) And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you! \n", "test1_input": "FRANCES Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York. \nHARRY Harry. \nFRANCES (hesitates, nods) Harry. \nThey half-smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. Then Harry doffs his hat. \nHARRY Bye. \nShe nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house. \nHARRY (admiring her) Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nCLOSE ON Judge Hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench. \nHILLIER These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas -- \nWOMAN'S VOICE I know. \nThe CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. We SEE that the courtroom is empty. \nHILLIER Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother? \nNow we SEE who he's talking to: Alma Styles, the woman who sat with Lillian at the school auditorium. \nSTYLES Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years. \nHILLIER What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals. \nSTYLES (shaking her head) He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition. \nHILLIER Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country. (sternly) Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma? \nSTYLES Of course, your honor. \nHe nods with satisfaction. Two right-thinking people fighting for what they believe in. \nINT. FARMER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nErnest Farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. Between two candles, facing him, is Frances' check for a hundred dollars. \nWe HEAR bustle from behind the kitchen door, then Lillian and Frances enter juggling several hot dishes. Ernest rises. They set down the dishes, Frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father. \nERNEST It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air. \nLILLIAN I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent. \nShe moves the bread so Ernest again faces the check. As Lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly. \nLILLIAN (offering to Ernest) Bread? \nERNEST (taking a piece) Thank you. \nLILLIAN When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer? \nFRANCES Mama... \nLILLIAN (pushing back her plate) I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration. \nShe leaves. A long silence. \nThey both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. \nFrances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight. \nERNEST I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances. \nFRANCES Thanks, Dad. \nERNEST An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive. \nFRANCES I didn't have much to do with it. \nERNEST You wrote it, didn't you? \nFRANCES Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York? \nERNEST Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask? \nFRANCES He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble. \nERNEST Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous. \nFRANCES Is Kaminski a Communist? \nERNEST No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation. \nFRANCES He's a socialist, then? \nINT. STUDY - LILLIAN - NIGHT \nSitting at a rolltop desk. She's looking through a large scrapbook. We SEE articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring Lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. She listens to the conversation in the other room. \n", "test1_true": "Lillian's face becomes set. She looks down at the book. An article titled \"Girl Denies God\" is there, freshly pasted. She lays a hand on the blank page opposite. \nFRANCES (V.O.) It's already started, Dad... with me. \nERNEST (V.O.) I know. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nFRANCES And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- (what I meant) \nLillian appears in the doorway. \nLILLIAN Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand? \nFRANCES Yes, Ma. \nLILLIAN And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself. \nShe stomps out. Frances and Ernest push back their plates. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN - NIGHT \nLillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly. As Ernest approaches, she senses him and grows silent. She speaks without turning around. \nLILLIAN You're poisoning that child's mind. \nERNEST I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve... \nLILLIAN You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents -- \nERNEST They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways. \nLILLIAN How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors! \nERNEST (sadly) No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism. \nLILLIAN That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure. \nBeat. \nERNEST I'm going back to the hotel. \nLILLIAN Good. \nERNEST See you next weekend? \nLILLIAN As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due. \nErnest starts back toward the house. He sees Frances watching them and slows down, turns... \nERNEST Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway. \nLILLIAN Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound. \nERNEST (under his breath) That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought. \nHe trudges back toward the house under Frances' eye. \nA WOMAN'S VOICE comes from behind the fence. \nNEIGHBOR'S VOICE Are you all right, dear? \nLILLIAN I'm fine, perfectly fine. \nOMITTED \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nErnest stands on the porch holding his little bag. \nFRANCES Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama -- \nERNEST Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away. \nHe trudges out and down the walk. \nFrances watches him, shaking her head. That is not a lesson she wants to learn. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nOMITTED \nINT. THEATRE LOBBY - NIGHT \nOpening night. Harry is reading a playbill displayed in a theatre lobby: \"1934 Spring Production... University of Washington Players Present: 'Uncle Vanya' by Anton Chekhov.\" Frances is playing Sonia. Harry turns and enters the theatre. \nOMITTED \nINT. UNIVERSITY THEATRE STAGE - NIGHT \nFrances on stage seen from a distance. \nFRANCES What can we do, we must live! We shall live, Uncle Vanya... \nFrances is acting with a nervous young man, CHET. As her speech progresses, the camera moves in nearer and nearer, ending with a close-up. It is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion. \n", "test1_id": 2340, "test2_input": "ODETS That's who my play is about. \nFrances watches the girl. \nFRANCES That's me, Clifford. \nODETS (strong) I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy -- \nINT. WORKING CLASS BAR - LATER \nThe same conversation continuing: \nFRANCES I'm not! \nODETS Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire! \nFRANCES But I want to. I'm trying! \nODETS I need an incendiary! An arsonist! \nFRANCES Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow! \nODETS Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you. \nEXT. PLATFORM - SPANISH EMBASSY - DAY \nClurman is delivering a speech in the background as PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures. Behind them on the platform Frances and Odets continue their conversation in whispers: \nODETS I can see it. You just have to let it out. Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle! \nWe now HEAR Clurman's speech. The initial words below were background to the above. What we HEAR now is underlined: \nCLURMAN ...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive. (presenting check to SPANISH CONSUL) The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too. \nFRANCES I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford. \nCLIFFORD Yes you are. We all are. The first step is to acknowledge our fear. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nThey're walking. The conversation continues. \nCLIFFORD Face it! Confess it! You're weak! \nFRANCES I'm not! \nCLIFFORD You're afraid! \nFRANCES I'm not! \nCLIFFORD You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it -- \nFRANCES (angry) God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up! \nShe is seething. Gorgeous. Alive. \nHe smiles, watching her. \nCLIFFORD Good, good. Give them that. \nFRANCES What? \nAs she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about. She looks at him, still breathing heavily. Gradually her face turns toward a smile. \nHe reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her. \nINT. ODETS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLater. They enter slightly drunk, laughing. He takes her coat. \nCLIFFORD Madam...? \nFRANCES Thank you. \nShe's looking at the apartment. He sees her. A dark thought flickers across his face, and he breaks into an exaggerated act: \nCLIFFORD Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... (gesturing off) her bedroom. I can't ask you to... \nFRANCES (playing along) Oh well. I guess I better leave then. \nShe starts to put on her coat. He watches her. \nCLIFFORD Okay, but come here first. \nFRANCES Huh. \nCLIFFORD (Leading her down hall) Come here. I want to show you something. \nHe opens the bedroom door. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe bed is drawn back, and the sheets are sprinkled with rose petals. \nFrances' eyes are large. \n", "test2_true": "INT. BEBE'S PANELLED OFFICE - HOLLYWOOD - DAY \nBebe's huge desk. Variety Headline: \"ACTRESS FIGHTS FASCISM!\" Next to the newspaper are a dozen pencils which Bebe is lining up precisely parallel. His expression is totally obsessive, crazed. \nBehind him a woman (TORA) is cutting his hair. A STUDIO LAWYER paces nearby. \nLAWYER And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures. \nBEBE (muttering) I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me... \nLAWYER Excuse me, sir? \nBEBE I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me. \nTora is massaging the back of Bebe's neck. He's oblivious. \nLAWYER (startled) Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics. \nBEBE That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it. \nLAWYER Oh. I mean, good. \nBEBE I think it's time to take the gloves off. (scowls, speaks into intercom) Get me some reporters. (afterthought) Particularly Louella Parsons! \nDuring this conversation, Bebe has been drawing on the Variety. We now see his work. Beneath the headline was a photo of Frances, on whom Bebe has drawn a mustache. \nCUT TO: \nOMITTED \nEXT. BELASCO THEATRE - NIGHT \nThe marquee for \"Golden Boy\" reads \"Held Over\". USHERS are opening the glass doors from the empty lobby onto the street. We HEAR thunderous applause from the inside. \nEXT. BACKSTAGE DOOR - ALLEY - NIGHT \nFrances emerges from the stage door to a throng of AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS. She smiles tiredly, but good-naturedly complies. A little ways back stands a boyish YOUNG MAN holding a single red carnation. When the Autograph-seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away, the Young Man steps forward. \nYOUNG MAN Miss Farmer... I've never done this before... but... I had to tell ya' you're great! \nHe shyly hands her the flower. \nFRANCES Thank you very much. I'm glad you liked the play. \nShe smiles and begins to walk away. The Young Man follows her. \nYOUNG MAN I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights? \nFRANCES You can always come see it in London. \nYOUNG MAN Only if you were in it. Are you? \nFRANCES I wouldn't miss it. \nYOUNG MAN Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood. \nFRANCES (smiling) Are you an actor? \nYOUNG MAN Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come! \nFRANCES (after a pause) Are you really serious? About acting? \nYOUNG MAN Why... yes. \nFRANCES Then don't go to Hollywood. \nYOUNG MAN Why? \nFRANCES I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you. \nYOUNG MAN You sound as if you hate it. \nFRANCES No, I don't hate it. \nAgain she walks on. He follows. \nYOUNG MAN Aren't you ever going back? \nFRANCES ...Not if I can help it. \nYOUNG MAN Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts. \nFRANCES They'll mend. \nYOUNG MAN (after a pause) What about your husband? \nFrances stops walking, her eyes shoot to the Young Man's face. \nFRANCES What? \nYOUNG MAN Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean. \nFRANCES What is this? \nThe Young Man suddenly seems much older, and there is no sign of the awkward boyishness. \n", "test2_id": 2341, "test3_input": "HARRY Frances, it's me, Harry? \nFRANCES ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig. \nDOCTOR Watch out, Harry. Let me look her over. \nHarry is on the verge of tears. \nHARRY Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us! \nDOCTOR The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her. \nHARRY Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... \nDOCTOR I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her. (pulling a hypodermic from his pocket) Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing. \nHarry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm. Frances starts to struggle and moan loudly. \nDOCTOR Yeah... she knows about these. Shut her up. \nHarry glares at the Doctor, but puts a hand over her mouth and the Doctor injects her. Her arm is covered with sores. \nHARRY (tenderly) You'll be okay, honey. He's just givin' you something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell 'em what they want to hear, okay? Tell 'em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and you're grateful. \nThe Doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm. \nDOCTOR This stuff takes pretty quick. Let's go. \nFRANCES (grabbing Harry) Please! Take me! \nOther women in the ward cry out: \"Take me! Take me!!\" \nDOCTOR (pulling Harry) Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job! \nHARRY Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em? \nFRANCES (groggily) I'm grateful... grateful. \nWOMEN IN WARD I'm grateful! I'm grateful! \nDOCTOR (very worried) Harry! \nHARRY I gotta go now. \nFRANCES Harry, please! \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe two Men come out and the Doctor quickly locks the door. \nDOCTOR We're all square now, Harry. Right? \nHARRY All square, Doc. \nDOCTOR Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again. \nFrances' face appears at the tiny barred window. We can just hear her: \nFRANCES I love you, Harry. I love you. \nHARRY I love you too, Frances. \nBehind Frances we HEAR the Women screaming: \"I love you, Harry!\" The Doctor takes Harry's arm and pulls him down the corridor. \nINT. WARD - NIGHT \nFrances turns to face the women in their cots. Collects herself. Looks repentant. She is practicing tomorrow's speech. \nFRANCES I realize now that I was a very sick woman. \nWOMEN IN WARD Sick! She's sick! \nFRANCES I couldn't relate to others in a normal way. \nONE PATIENT (playful warning) She's... not... normal...! \nThe others laugh. We realize that if Frances can handle this, she can sail through it tomorrow. The catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech. \nFRANCES And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope... I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much. \nThe room is silent now. A very odd moment. To their astonishment, the other patients seem to believe her... \nEXT. FARMER HOUSE - SUNNY DAY \nThe vegetable garden is overgrown, the paint peeling. The house is in disrepair, but we can tell from the freshly-mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made... \nA car pulls up. Frances kisses Ernest on the cheek and gets out. As he drives off, she walks into the yard and looks around, heaves a sigh; she's home. Then Christmas lights spring on over the porch. Lillian comes out grinning broadly, followed by REPORTERS. Frances blanches. \nINT. FARMER HOUSE - DAY \nFrances sits on the couch next to Lillian. They're sipping tea and answering questions. Frances is uncomfortable. \nLILLIAN Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind. \nFRANCES No. No, it all depends on what offers I get. \n", "test3_true": "She touches it shyly. It's swept up in a continental style. \nFRANCES Well, I like to try different styles. Sometimes if you're old-fashioned enough, you find you're modern. Right, Mama? \nLillian laughs. \nREPORTER What do you think of all this, Mrs. Farmer? \nLILLIAN It's a miracle. Just a miracle. \nEXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe porch light goes out. Shadows pass over the curtained windows. Across the street a match flares. Harry is leaning against a tree. He lights a cigarette and settles back to wait. \nINT. FARMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLillian walks from room to room turning off lights. Frances is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray. Very domestic, out of character. She carries the tray into the kitchen. \nLILLIAN Oh, just leave those things for now. \nFRANCES No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning. \nLillian smiles warmly at her. \nLILLIAN You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back. \nFRANCES Thank you for understanding, Mama. \nLillian links her arm with Frances' and they go upstairs together. \nLILLIAN Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway. \nFRANCES I will, I promise. \nThey hug each other. \nLILLIAN Good night, dear. \nLillian waits until Frances has shut her door before closing hers. \nEXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe front door opens and Frances, suitcase in hand, slips out onto the porch. She eases the door shut behind her, tiptoes down the steps and, without looking back, starts down the road. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nFrances rounds the corner, then sees him: Harry, standing by his car, smiling. \nHARRY Where to? \nFRANCES Oh Harry... \nShe approaches him tentatively. \nHARRY This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it. \nFRANCES Yeah. I don't know. \nHARRY You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me. \nFRANCES I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl. \nLong beat. She turns and stares at him sadly. \nFRANCES You can't change the things they did to me, Harry.

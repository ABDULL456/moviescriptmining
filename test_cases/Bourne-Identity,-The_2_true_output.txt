THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and -- 
HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY 
HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died." 
And so begins, the investigation... 
Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene is not finished. 
The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever "social engineering" needs doing. 
Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi. 
Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks very much different than we've ever seen her before. 
She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne waiting and -- 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY 
Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! -- she's got the hotel record in hand -- 
MARIE You stayed there five times in the past six months. But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days. Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- 
BOURNE (cutting her off) Who paid the bill? 
MARIE It's a company... MPG Capital. 
INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY 
Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there staring. 
MARIE This can't be it. 
She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the glass door -- 
And as he's doing this, we're hearing -- 
TELEPHONE VOICE (OVER) (British, female) Destin Navigational, can I help you? 
BOURNE'S VOICE (OVER) Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach Richard? Is he there. 
We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and MARIE react, as we hear -- 
TELEPHONE VOICE I'm afraid there's no Richard here. (continuing into --) 
INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's got a pad and paper. This is all business. 
BOURNE Well, where are you? Where am I calling? 
TELEPHONE VOICE This is an answering service, sir. The company's located in Southampton, but -- 
BOURNE -- this is a tire dealership, right? 
TELEPHONE VOICE No sir, this is a navigational chart registry. I'm afraid you have the wrong number. 
Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does -- 
TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number two -- 
NEW VOICE (OVER) (French, male, hassled) Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I help you? 
BOURNE Hey, so this is the Marina, right? 
NEW VOICE Yes, sir. Can I help you? 
BOURNE (he's got the number) This is the one in Marseille, right? 
NEW VOICE (Last time I looked.) 
TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number three --

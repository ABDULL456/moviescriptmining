BILL gets up. 
BILL Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm ready.  Frozen yogurt? 
ALICE smiles at the reference. 
ALICE I'll be along. 
NED (in a nelly voice) Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out... 
They head off.  ALICE turns over to tan her front. 
CUT TO: 
50    EXT. FOREST - DAY 
A machete rips through some vines.  Again it hacks at the brush. 
PULLS BACK to reveal BILL clearing away the years of vine growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration from his eyes and continues along. 
CUT TO: 
51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY 
Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement. 
ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He explodes his breath. 
We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt about his strength. 
BRENDA Not bad. 
As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take. 
NED Holy shit... 
BRENDA We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we? 
CUT TO: 
52    EXT. LAKE - DAY 
The sun has dropped lower on the horizon. 
The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with a start. 
CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete. 
ALICE I didn't know I was asleep...What time is it? 
BILL Almost five. 
ALICE gets up. 
ALICE Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.  Steve is going to have a small cow. 
They walk away from the shore. 
CUT TO: 
53    EXT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY 
ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it. 
BILL You can only do what you can do. 
ALICE And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes--like you don't care about children...

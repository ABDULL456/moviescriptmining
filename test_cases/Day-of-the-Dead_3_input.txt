They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. None are red and none have orange circles. 
As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard. 
The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the "Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a more private supper.

SARAH What is that? Could that be....? 
Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his mouth to keep from making noise. 
SARAH No. They must have gotten them to accept....other things. They wouldn't be feeding them with....they wouldn't... 
51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves to torture disobedient zombies.) 
Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices. 
RHODES You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the only way. They don't bite the hand that feeds. TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND distracts him. 
ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the creature but that just makes it angrier. 
RHODES GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS! BRING IT HERE! 
ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to control the creature while keeping it out of reach. 
52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and sees the danger. 
TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE and...RATTATATTATATT! 
53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins. 
RHODES We have visitors. Let's go men. 
He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a different pattern. 
THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh. 
RHODES Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would obey orders the way they do. 
54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY 
Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!! 
THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches forward, dead. 
CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED. 
Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover. 
55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY 
THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of them grossly off target. 
RHODES THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL- SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM! 
The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.

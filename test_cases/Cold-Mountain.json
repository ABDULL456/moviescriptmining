{"test1_input": "Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, knocking him back into the mud. \nINMAN Jesus, god! \nVEASEY I figure that righteous, given our history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge on our journey. \nINMAN There's nowhere I'm going with you except to Hellfire! \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nAda, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some earrings. \nA pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them. \nADA Agricola poetis viam non monstrat. \nRUBY Which means? \nADA The farmer does not point out the road to a poet. \nRUBY Which means? Should be the other way round \nADA Which means, I suppose, which means the poet should know where he's going. \nRUBY (of Ada's hairdressing) It's no wonder you're helpless and hopeless if it takes this long to fix your hair. (of the Latin) Say some more. \nADA Terra mutata non mutat mores. (can't believe she knows all these phrases by heart) It's appalling what's in my head. \nRUBY It's appalling what's in my head? \nADA No, it means: A change of place does not change a character. \nRUBY Well that's surely true even in English. \nADA You can keep those earrings. \nRUBY We can't keep anything. \nADA I have to keep the bangles. They were my mother's. \nRUBY Well that's all. The rest is for trading. Else they can bury you in your finery. \nADA (of her hair) You're done. \nThere's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle. \nRUBY Good God! Okay. \nShe takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait. \nADA I like it. \nRUBY Takes two minutes. That's what I like. \nShe puts the earrings back in the pile. \nRUBY How much do you love that piano? \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK \nTHE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr. Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard. Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house. \nINT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK \nAda arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in, struggling with the last sack, pleased. \nRUBY We're careful we'll get through the winter now. I made old man Roy give me ten of those sheep on account of I said they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper sheep. \nADA My father always wanted sheep on this land. \nRUBY I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. I cut off my hair once, for money. My daddy got two dollars for it. Made a wig for a rich feller in Raleigh. \nThey're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal. \nRUBY Stobrod called himself a musician -- my daddy -- he could play six tune on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead at Petersburg. I was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post. He left me once, up the mountains. I was eight. He was gone over two weeks. \nADA Oh Ruby. \nRUBY (defiant) I was all right! He'd walk forty miles for liquor and not forty inches for kindness. \nADA And your mother? \nRUBY Never met her. We're the same in that regard. He said she was -- he told me a thousand stories -- she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. Don't say much for him, except you know he'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it. \nThere's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly she jumps up. \nRUBY There's cows to milk. \n", "test1_true": "Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to concentrate. Veasey presides, complaining... \nVEASEY Used to be as regular as morning prayers. Matter of fact I could set my watch by my bowels. That beeswax you fed me, day before yesterday, it stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd find turds stacked up like little black twigs. \nOn a parallel track across the river, RIDERS... impossible to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party. Inman splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing him. The riders pass. \nVeasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW. \nVEASEY Hey! Look at this! (flexing it) This is a good saw. \nINMAN (getting up) It's not yours. You take it, you make us another enemy. You're a Christian -- don' t you know your commandments? \nVEASEY You'll find the good Lord very flexible on the subject of property. We could do a lot with this saw... \nInman is vexed, walks away. Veasey follows, experimenting with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on. \nEXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY \nInman way ahead, full of purpose. Veasey still has the saw, trots to catch up. \nVEASEY Why you in such a hurry the whole time? (no answer) Hurry or slow the destination is always the same. It's only the journey that is different. That's either in the Good Book or I made it up. \nInman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens. \nInman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, edges towards the river bank. \nA HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford and died. The man is wet and exasperated. \nVEASEY Good day to you! \nThe man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect of help. His name is JUNIOR. He's working on roping the animal. \nJUNIOR My old bull, wandered off and died in this here creek. Fouled up our water is how I found it. \nVeasey is immediately an authority on bull removal. \nVEASEY This is a tricky one. \nThe three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the swarms of flies. Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor. \nInman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily. \nVEASEY The name for the Bull's member is a tassel. I learned that and never forgot it. \nJUNIOR Reckon I need a train of mules. \nVEASEY (walking away) I'm getting an idea. My saw is the remedy. Let's saw up some wood and make levers. \nINMAN Then what? \nVEASEY Lever him out. This'll work! \nHe walks into the wood. \nJUNIOR Where you two sports heading? \nINMAN (inscrutable) I don't know where he's heading. I'm going down the road. And I got a good way to go before nightfall. \nJUNIOR (acknowledging his attitude) Charitable of you to make a stop. Ain't for me to be curious. \nVEASEY (emerges from the woods) How do you work this damn thing? \nINMAN (to Veasey) Give me that saw. (to Junior) Come on. \nHe takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, indicates Junior should go to the other. \nINMAN Let's do this in chapters. \nAnd they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK. \nLATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest of the animal onto the banks. They're exhausted. \nINMAN You might want to leave off that water for a day or two. \nJUNIOR There'll be a tang, I'd imagine. \nEXT. TRACK APPROACHING JUNIOR'S CABIN. EVENING \nJunior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey. \nJUNIOR There's my place. Hope you can stomach a yard chock-full of females. Brought my woman home, she showed up with her three so-called sisters and their brats. The noise in that place is something awful. It's why I go hunting. \nVEASEY (considering the wild camber) Looks a bit crooked. \nJUNIOR It is on a bit of a tilt. Them females. They all roll down one end each night! \nVEASEY -- Roll me over! \n", "test1_id": 2529, "test2_input": "TEAGUE With that trap. \nRUBY We got some critter stealing our corn. \nTEAGUE Still but the two of you up there, is it? \nRUBY You know it. \nTEAGUE When we get a cold night, camped out, trying to keep the rule of law, protecting girls like you from Federals and deserters, that's a thought warms us (to his men) ain't it? -- the two of you up there on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in men's clothes. Warms us right up. What you got in the sacks? (to the men) Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks like a bunch of heads. We got competition! \nRuby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far from the Swanger farm. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY \nGoats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nSally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate. \nSALLY Ruby... \nRUBY I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not snooping neither. Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by Pigeon River, the old mill. \nSALLY (after a beat) You tell Ada that was a good pie. \nRuby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint. \nEXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON \nHARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. HER NAME IS MADDY. \nShe and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan. \nMADDY Mind that Billy, he's the jealous kind. \nShe emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself. \nMADDY Pay no attention to me. What happened to your head? \nINMAN Fighting. \nMADDY And your neck? \nINMAN Different fighting. \nMADDY You're the color of a cadaver. I'll fix you. I can fix you up. \nINMAN (speaking of his spirit) Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in your everlasting debt. \nMADDY Debts, fighting -- them words don't mean much round here. For the record, I'm a female of the species. \nEXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field. \nRUBY The hat's a nice touch. \nRuby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks. \nRUBY You're quiet. \nADA I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back, his arms out, said you never cried enough, you never cried enough. \nRUBY Well now you did. \nADA Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, it's my sweetheart. I saw him once that way, when I looked down Sally's well. So I dressed the scarecrow in the dress I wore the day he left. In case his spirit flies over looking out for me. (of the vicious looking trap) That looks terrible. \nRuby opens the sacks. \nADA Cabbages. \nRUBY I bargained like Lucifer. We can make all kinds of good eating. \nADA Such as? \nRUBY Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage soup, fried cabbage, stuffed cabbage... \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nTEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his bearing, and BOSIE. \nTEAGUE Afternoon. \nThe riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed. \nESCO Don't spread out. Why they spreading out? \n", "test2_true": "Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands. \nTEAGUE Never knew a man worked in his field with a shotgun. \nESCO There's a war on. \nTEAGUE Got to watch out for the Bogey Man. \nHe starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up. \nTeague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a cigarette. \nINT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nFrom inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view impaired by the sheets. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nMo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets. ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing. \nESCO Get off my land. \nMo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting. \nTEAGUE Your boys come back. \nESCO Ain't seen my boys in four years. They're fighting other boys, not old men and women. \nTEAGUE (to his men) He means us. He's referring there to us. (to Esco) So you won't care if we take a look around? \nESCO What I gotta give you? A chicken? A lamb? \nTEAGUE (shrugs) Sure. \nESCO Right then. \nTEAGUE Thing is -- you got one barrel and there's five of us. Not a fair fight. \nBOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND. \nBOSIE Bogey Man! Bogey Man! \nEsco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires into the air, a shocking sound. \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot. \nRUBY What's that? \nThey stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nJo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and spreading. Teague walks to Esco. \nTEAGUE You're harbouring deserters. I can confiscate every animal on this farm, every plate, every sheet, every little pellet of chicken shit -- I can confiscate your old lady's asshole, so don't offer me a bird. \nSally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre. \nMO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND. \nTEAGUE (sharply) Hey! \nMo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red. \nTEAGUE You got your bait. Set it on the hook. \nBOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD. \nINT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY \nELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nBOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence. \nUNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt. \nHer two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT TO ACTON'S BODY. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK \nAda and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the Swangers. \nSALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence. \n", "test2_id": 2530, "test3_input": "SARA I don't want it. I had my way they'd take metal altogether out of this world. Every blade, every gun. \nINMAN Is your baby sick? \nSARA He cries. I don't know. He cries a lot. My man is dead. He took his wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw his boy. \nShe never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby. \nINMAN I'm sorry. \nSARA It's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war. Man dead, woman left. \nShe hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on top. \nSARA It's mean food but it's hot. \nShe goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire. \nHe picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across. \nINMAN (ashamed of his hunger) There's no hunting on the road, just cress and -- \nHe takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby. \nSARA I need to feed this man, if you could look away. \nInman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds. \nSARA Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders took them. Made me kill our own dog on the porch. That poor creature watched over me. Nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring. I'll have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something I never did. \nINMAN I could do that for you in the morning. \nSARA I'm not asking. \nINMAN It's what I'd gladly do for you for what you're gladly doing for me. I'm Inman by the way. That's my name. \nSARA I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan. \nINMAN Glad to know you both. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nSara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm. She hands him the clothes. \nSARA You look about his size. He was another man straight up and down. \nThere's a palpable attraction between them, so that every exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge. \nSARA I don't even have a blanket. \nINMAN I got a blanket. \nSARA I'll leave you the lamp. \nBy the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nSara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen. \nSARA They fit? \nINMAN (O.S.) Pretty much. These boots are good boots. \nSARA I'll say good night. \nINMAN (O.S.) Good night. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nInman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara in there. He reluctantly settles down again. \nHE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS UNDER THE BLANKETS. \nSARA Will you come inside? \nShe stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes back inside. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nInman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence. \nSARA Could you do something for me? Do you think you could lie here, next to me, and not need to go further? \nINMAN I don't know. I'll try. \nHe sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him. \n", "test3_true": "INMAN I'll go. I'll go, shall I? \nSARA I don't want you to. \nThey lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING... \nINT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, with a harmonica. As they play: \nPANGLE (of Sally) She don't speak. \nSTOBROD She can't speak. I told you. \nPANGLE (smiles at Sally) Is she feeble then? \nSTOBROD No. (to Sally) Don't mind him. (to Ruby) Hey Ruby: what about this? \nHe starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans. \nSTOBROD Don't make that face -- you listen: c'mon Georgia... \nAnd he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING. \nHe's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice. \nRuby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own. \nEXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING \nThey're all outside now, shaking hands. \nGEORGIA There's snow in the air. \nRUBY Don't sleep here. \nSTOBROD We won't. \nADA It's bitter, they could stop one night. \nRUBY They stop one night, they'll want to stop two. \nPANGLE This coat's warm. \nSTOBROD What about next Sunday? That'll be the New Year. It's gonna be a better one. \nRUBY Maybe. \nGEORGIA The war's over in a month. \nRUBY He said that a month ago. \nADA (shaking Stobrod's hand in goodnight) It started off being over in a month. \nSTOBROD Miss Ada. Merry Christmas. \nADA Merry Christmas. Pangle. Georgia. \nGEORGIA 'Night. \nPANGLE 'Night now. \nThe three women walk down the lane, the three men watch. \nSTOBROD That's my Ruby. \nGEORGIA She's an original. \nSTOBROD You think the Good Lord would forgive an old cold fool if he changed his mind? Ada said it herself it was bitter... \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. NIGHT \nThe three women head towards Sally's house. \nRUBY What kind of name's Georgia? \nADA It's where he comes from, it's not his name. \nRUBY I know that's meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens. \nADA Why do you care what his name is? \nRUBY (a funny look, then) What's that cluster of Stars? \nADA Orion. \nRUBY What about them shaped like a wishbone? \n", "test3_id": 2531}

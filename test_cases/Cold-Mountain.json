{"train": "\"COLD MOUNTAIN\" \nby \nAnthony Minghella \nBased On The Novel \"Cold Mountain\" \nby \nCharles Frazier \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY \nON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits. \nA RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMER\u0092S) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE. \nA RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack. \nTheir opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack. \nA ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose. \nHis team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge. \nA PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by. \nThe driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self- conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by her. An angel in this wild place. \nNow Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into English: \nSWIMMER\u0092S VOICE (V.O.) You will be lonely. You will howl like a dog as you walk alone. You will carry dog shit cupped in your hands. You will be smeared with dog shit. Your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair... \nAs the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing. \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT \nA SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a gash in Inman\u0092s cheek as he continues to translate: \nSWIMMER ...This is your path. There is no other. That's a curse you can use on the Yankee before battle. \nINMAN And that works? \nSWIMMER You have to say it in Cherokee. \nINMAN You said it to me in Cherokee. \nDuring this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, and winces with pain. \nSWIMMER So keep your head still. \nSally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe pluckily follows suit. \nINMAN (to Swimmer) Anyway, there won't be any war. And if there is, they say it won't last a week. \nEND OF CREDITS AND FADE TO: \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN \nCAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR. \nA STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty. \nA second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches. \nIN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling. \nINT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN. \nA dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN. \nYoung OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. Oakley keeps his head low as he serves. \nROURKE Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys keep store hours. They ain't open yet. \nINT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN \nShadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN \nA RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher. \nBUTCHER That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him! \nADA I've been missing it. \nSALLY Thank you, by the way. (from Ada's quizzical look) Inman's down in the bottom field, clearing his debt. \nADA Oh dear. And then he had nothing to say. \nSALLY He was happy. \nADA Really? \nSALLY Are men so different in Charleston? \nADA Men? I don't know. I don't even know what a woman should be like. In Charleston I was called a thistle, twice, by two different men. Both of them -- they were hunting for a simile, what was I like -- and thistle came right to them. \nSALLY If you're saying you might like him, why not go down and say hello. \nEXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY \nInman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles off down the track. \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nIt's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO. \nMen and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window to Inman, who stands, watching, listening. \nINT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nMonroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm. \nMONROE Esco, our friends there -- (indicating Teague and co.) -- they helped build the Chapel? \nESCO That's Teague and his boys. I'd recommend you kick them out except a man don't kick a snake. One time the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, all belonged to his grand-daddy. Teague wanted this place bad. You got it. He's here sniffing out an advantage. \nMONROE There's no advantage here, but to celebrate a job well done. Cheers -- (he raises his glass) -- and thank you. \nAnd Teague raises his glass across the room. \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nAda appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman. \nADA Were you planning to come inside? \nINMAN I'm wetter than a fish. \nADA There's a good fire going. \nINMAN I'm all right. \nADA Somebody said you were enlisting. (no response) Are you? \nINMAN If there's a war we'll all fight. \nADA (unimpressed) If there's a mountain we'll all climb, if there's an ocean we'll all drown. \nINMAN Call a thing a war makes it a challenge to some men. \nADA Did you get a picture made? \nINMAN Say again. \nADA A tintype, with your gun and your courage on display. \nINMAN You're laughing at me. \nADA I don't know you. \nINMAN You're always carrying a tray. \nADA I'm taking a drink over to the negroes in the barn. \nINMAN (takes the tray) I'll do that. I can't get much wetter. \nHe goes into the night rain. She watches him. \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nA beautiful day, the farm peaceful. Inman walks up the path to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave woman weeding. He knocks on the door. Monroe answers. \nMONROE Mr. Inman. \nINMAN Reverend. \nMONROE What can I do for you? \nInman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward. \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nMonroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down. \nMONROE (of his appointment) I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to do a test or two. \nADA And then there'll be a coffee or two, a brandy or two... \nMonroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada heads into the store. \nINT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nINMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed. \nHe's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door. \nHe opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her. \nINT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nAda waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward. \nADA I found you this book. William Bartram. They tell me it's good. I think he writes about these parts, the author, so... \nInman takes it. \nShe has something else. Wrapped in paper. \nADA And this... (hands it to him) I'm not smiling in it. I don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now I'm solemn... \nINMAN Ada... \nADA What? \nHE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist. \nBelow them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs. \nInman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front door. \nROURKE Let's go! \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nRourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE HILL -- \nEXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY \n-- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE RAILROAD. \nA TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE PLAYS, THEN A BANJO. \nINT. BOX CAR. DAY \nA CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle away. His voice is a croak, spoiled. \nINMAN I'm not dying. \nSTOBROD (to Pangle) What'd he say? \nPANGLE Says he ain't about to die. \nSTOBROD (to Inman) Truth to tell they say you are, Soldier. We'll meet again, in the better world. \nHe changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering sound... \nEXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \n-- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to mount. It's a memorial service without bodies. \nRiders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow sinister. \nTEAGUE My condolences to you all. (he considers the slave) Keep an eye on the negro. They want what the white man got -- all of you watch out your brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder, rape and arson to your firesides. \nMONROE The only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm. They're good Christians and I'll vouchsafe for them. \nEXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nCold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before. \nADA What? \nMONROE You're looking -- at this moment, I don't know why -- you're looking exactly like your mother. \nADA Every time you see the doctor you get melancholy. \nMONROE He listens to my heart and I get emotional. \nADA I'm not sorry, but I don't know how we'll get through another winter. \nMONROE Will you play me something? Something peaceful while I look over my sermon. \nAda takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen and ink. \nINT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK \nADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works. \nAda plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then the steady drumming of a summer shower. \nADA (still playing) Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you! \nShe plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes on to the window.. \nADA Daddy, come inside before you drown! \nAfter a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO \nABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER. \nHe's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down the lane. \nADA (V.O.) Dear Mr. Inman... \nINT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT \nINMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run. \nMRS. MORGAN It's come to you by way of Virginia. \nThere are various dates, which she decodes. \nMRS. MORGAN It's not too recent -- written this past winter. I'm afraid I can't read who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman, \nINT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nAda is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room. \nADA (V.O.) -- I'm still waiting, as I promised I would, but I find myself alone and at the end of my wits -- \nINT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT \nMrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter: \nMRS. MORGAN -- at the end of my wits, so now I say to you, plain as I can, come back to me. Come back to me is my request. (can't read the next bit) Then something I can't read, something, come back to me. \nInman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, gives a TINY NOD. \nOFFICIAL (O.S.) By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog. \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nAda walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a document. \nOFFICIAL -- Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason. \nThe Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter the store. \nOFFICIAL The Home Guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit, without notice or constraint. Names of all deserters will be posted in every town, published in every newspaper. \nINT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nThe Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches Mrs Castlereagh, the owner. \nADA Is there a letter for me? \nMRS. CASTLEREAGH Nothing -- we're getting no post through at all -- although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived. \nThey go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books. \nMRS. CASTLEREAGH If folks knew I was taking deliveries from the North. \nADA I know. Thank you so much. \nMRS. CASTLEREAGH The sooner we lose this war the better. Already one boy gone, another with his leg took off at the knee. That's enough. \nADA What do you hear? \nMRS. CASTLEREAGH All I know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters. \nEXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY \nAda emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past him, tries to make her package invisible. \nEXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY \nEVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the packed dirt. \nSally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the chickens, and knock at the door. \nSALLY Ada! Ada, It's Sally. \nThey're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed. \nESCO Will you look at the state of this place! \nSALLY Poor soul. She's got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery. \nDuring this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house. \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nAda dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket for something less dirty. \nINT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nAda enters her father's room, wearing undergarments. \nEverything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image swings into -- \nEXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY \n-- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak. \nBLIND MAN Getting better all the time. \nINMAN Seems that way. \nBLIND MAN I wouldn't hurry. War's almost done. \nINMAN Where'd you take your wound? \nBLIND MAN Before I was born. Never saw a thing in this world, not a tree a gun or a woman. Though I put my hand on all three. Couple of things I felt back there I'd sure liked to have had a long look at. \nHe's shoveling some peanuts into a twist of paper. \nINMAN What would you give for that? To have your eyeballs back for ten minutes? \nBLIND MAN Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian head cent. I fear it might turn me hateful. \nINMAN That's sure what seeing's done to me. \nBLIND MAN That ain't the way I meant it. You said ten minutes. It's having a thing and then the loss I'm talking about. \nINMAN Then we don't agree. There's not much I wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace. \nBLIND MAN Someplace or someone. \nINMAN Same difference. \nBLIND MAN You watch yourself. They're shooting men who take themselves a walk. \nEXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY \nInman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers. \nINT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY \nTWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand and gives him an apple from the barrel. \nEXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY \nInman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE, SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND... \nBARBER Next. \nInman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck. \nBARBER (nervous) I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about to shave you. That thing opens up, your head's liable to falloff. \nINT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN \nIt is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND INTO THE WORLD. \nEXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN \nInman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital... \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \n-- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her father's coat. \nSALLY (V.O.) Ada... \nRUBY What's the rake for? \nADA The rake? \nRUBY Ain't for gardening, that's for sure. Number one -- you got a horse I can plow all day. I'm a worker. Number two there's no man better than me cause there's no man around who ain't old or full of mischief. I know your plight. \nADA My plight? \nRUBY Am I hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything. I'm not looking for money, never cared for it and now it ain't worth nothing. I expect to board and eat at the same table. I'm not a servant. Do you get my meaning? \nADA You're not a servant. \nRUBY People'll have to empty their own night jars, that's my point. \nADA Right. \nRUBY And I'm not planning to work while you watch neither. \nADA Right. \nRUBY Is that a yes or a no? \nADA (looks at Ruby) Yes. \nRUBY There's half the day yet. Let's make a start. My name's Ruby. I know your name. \nADA The rake: there's a rooster devil, I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself. I go near him he's at me with his spurs. \nRUBY I despise a flogging rooster. Where is he? \nAda gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over. \nThe Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent. \nIN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS HEAD. \nRUBY Let's put him in a pot. \nEXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN \nInman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the Home Guard. \nInman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them. \nINMAN Hey! (they stop, turn) I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece of cheese. \nThey look at him, then continue on their way. \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN \nAda wakes up to persistent knocking. \nRUBY Ada? Ada? You up? \nADA Yes. (opening her eyes) It's still dark. \nRUBY Tell the cows that. It's late. \nINT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN \nAda enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy. \nADA I have to eat something. \nRUBY Then you have to get up earlier. (at Ada's book) What's that? \nADA A novel. \nRUBY (heading outside) You want to carry a book carry one you can write in -- \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN \nRuby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato. \nRUBY -- we got our own story. Called Black Cove Farm: a catastrophe. \nShe looks back at Ada for a reaction. \nRUBY I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe. Learned the same place you did, in the schoolroom. That's one of the first words they taught me. Ruby Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h- e... \nThey're heading for the stable. \nINT. STABLE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada. \nRUBY You mucking out? \nVEASEY She's got my bastard in her belly. What kind of pistol is that I never saw the like of it? \nEXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT \nInman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied behind his back, desperate for a reprieve. \nVEASEY I'm begging you. It's better you blowout my brains than return me to this place. \nINMAN Where does she live? \nVEASEY In our house. She sleeps in our kitchen. You don't know me, friend, but the good Lord punished me with want. I am all appetite. That's all I do all day is want: food, the female parts... \nINMAN Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon every time I ask a question. \nThey're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and next to it, a small house. \nINMAN This your place? \nVEASEY Dear God of misery. \nINMAN You're going to put her back where she sleeps. \nVEASEY I do that the Members will lynch me. Consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as their preacher. We're a strict congregation we've churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath. \nINMAN So you reckoned to kill her. \nDisgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house. \nVEASEY There's a back door. Have pity. \nAnd he leads Inman down a side path. \nINT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT \nVeasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire. \nVEASEY (whispering) Thank you. I was going to do a grievous wrong. \nHe looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around her shoulders. He turns to Inman. \nVESEY You tasted dark meat? Sweet as liquorice. I think I should go back up to my wife. She wakes at the slightest noise. \nInman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed... \nINMAN You find me some paper and a pen. \nEXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN \nINMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks. \nVEASEY You're not entitled to judge me! You're nothing but an outlier, plain as daylight! \nInman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing through the handkerchief. \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN \nAda asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm. \nRUBY Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in the woods? \nADA No. What? No. We bought our hams. \nRUBY There's a world more to a hog than the two hams! Lard, for example, we'll need plenty -- \nShe picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the overflowing laundry basket. \nRUBY The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's laundry. (marching out) I can feel you shutting your eyes. \nEXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nAda and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, Ruby is testing Ada. \nRUBY What's this wood? \nADA I don't know. Locust? \nRUBY Where's North? \nADA North is, North is -- \nRUBY Name me three herbs growing wild on this farm. \nADA (frustrated with Ruby and with herself) I can't! I can't! All right? I can talk about farming in Latin. Will that do? I can read French. I know Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my Bible. I can name the principal rivers of Europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county. I can embroider, but I can't darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable. \nRUBY Why? \nADA Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much everything to do with me. \nInman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, knocking him back into the mud. \nINMAN Jesus, god! \nVEASEY I figure that righteous, given our history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge on our journey. \nINMAN There's nowhere I'm going with you except to Hellfire! \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nAda, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some earrings. \nA pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them. \nADA Agricola poetis viam non monstrat. \nRUBY Which means? \nADA The farmer does not point out the road to a poet. \nRUBY Which means? Should be the other way round \nADA Which means, I suppose, which means the poet should know where he's going. \nRUBY (of Ada's hairdressing) It's no wonder you're helpless and hopeless if it takes this long to fix your hair. (of the Latin) Say some more. \nADA Terra mutata non mutat mores. (can't believe she knows all these phrases by heart) It's appalling what's in my head. \nRUBY It's appalling what's in my head? \nADA No, it means: A change of place does not change a character. \nRUBY Well that's surely true even in English. \nADA You can keep those earrings. \nRUBY We can't keep anything. \nADA I have to keep the bangles. They were my mother's. \nRUBY Well that's all. The rest is for trading. Else they can bury you in your finery. \nADA (of her hair) You're done. \nThere's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle. \nRUBY Good God! Okay. \nShe takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait. \nADA I like it. \nRUBY Takes two minutes. That's what I like. \nShe puts the earrings back in the pile. \nRUBY How much do you love that piano? \nEXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK \nTHE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr. Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard. Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house. \nINT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK \nAda arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in, struggling with the last sack, pleased. \nRUBY We're careful we'll get through the winter now. I made old man Roy give me ten of those sheep on account of I said they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper sheep. \nADA My father always wanted sheep on this land. \nRUBY I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. I cut off my hair once, for money. My daddy got two dollars for it. Made a wig for a rich feller in Raleigh. \nThey're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal. \nRUBY Stobrod called himself a musician -- my daddy -- he could play six tune on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead at Petersburg. I was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post. He left me once, up the mountains. I was eight. He was gone over two weeks. \nADA Oh Ruby. \nRUBY (defiant) I was all right! He'd walk forty miles for liquor and not forty inches for kindness. \nADA And your mother? \nRUBY Never met her. We're the same in that regard. He said she was -- he told me a thousand stories -- she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. Don't say much for him, except you know he'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it. \nThere's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly she jumps up. \nRUBY There's cows to milk. \nSALLY Like a coupla scarecrows after a thunderstorm. \nRUBY We need a scarecrow, birds eating up half our winter garden. \nADA Sally's right. We should both stop toiling and stand a while with our arms stretch out. I'll volunteer. \nRUBY We got something for you. \nADA For all your kindness. Coffee. And a pie. \nRUBY That's real coffee. It ain't hickory and dirt. \nSALLY (taking the gifts) Thank you both. (of the pie) Ruby, I look forward to this. We all do. Esco and me. \nRUBY (grinning at Ada) She made it. \nADA I made it. \nSALLY Good God in Heaven. \nRUBY (by way of recommendation) I'm still alive. \nSally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at the gifts... \nRUBY We'll be getting along. \nSALLY (nodding) I know Esco's going to be real sorry he missed you. You all take care. \nThey all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby is vexed. \nRUBY That strike you as odd? \nADA What? \nRUBY Stood at her front door? \nADA Sally? \nRUBY Number one -- I know that woman all my life. I never stood outside her house -- she'd invite a wolf inside if it knocked on the door. \nADA Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she was busy. \nRUBY Number two -- Old Man Swanger was inside that house: I could smell his pipe burning. Number three -- look at these fields. \nADA What about them? \nShe contemplated the stubble fields they're passing. \nRUBY We came by here a week ago, they were waist high in hay. \nEXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT \nThe Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey among them. Veasey has grown some beard. \nAN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving. \nThere's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He doesn't move. \nINMAN He's dead. \nThe horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader. \nINMAN This man's dead! \nNobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body. \nEXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY \nTHE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH. \nMore days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the prisoners to a horse rail. \nCitizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise Veasey. \nVEASEY Am I so altered that they don't see me? \nSomebody walks by with a young child. \nVeasey looks at Inman. \nVEASEY I christened that child. \nThe child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low. \nSHEFFIELD I'm looking to get out of this. They drag us back to fight -- we're just target practice for the Federal boys. \nINMAN You run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both. \nTEAGUE With that trap. \nRUBY We got some critter stealing our corn. \nTEAGUE Still but the two of you up there, is it? \nRUBY You know it. \nTEAGUE When we get a cold night, camped out, trying to keep the rule of law, protecting girls like you from Federals and deserters, that's a thought warms us (to his men) ain't it? -- the two of you up there on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in men's clothes. Warms us right up. What you got in the sacks? (to the men) Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks like a bunch of heads. We got competition! \nRuby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far from the Swanger farm. \nEXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY \nGoats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nSally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate. \nSALLY Ruby... \nRUBY I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not snooping neither. Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by Pigeon River, the old mill. \nSALLY (after a beat) You tell Ada that was a good pie. \nRuby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint. \nEXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON \nHARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. HER NAME IS MADDY. \nShe and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan. \nMADDY Mind that Billy, he's the jealous kind. \nShe emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself. \nMADDY Pay no attention to me. What happened to your head? \nINMAN Fighting. \nMADDY And your neck? \nINMAN Different fighting. \nMADDY You're the color of a cadaver. I'll fix you. I can fix you up. \nINMAN (speaking of his spirit) Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in your everlasting debt. \nMADDY Debts, fighting -- them words don't mean much round here. For the record, I'm a female of the species. \nEXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field. \nRUBY The hat's a nice touch. \nRuby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks. \nRUBY You're quiet. \nADA I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back, his arms out, said you never cried enough, you never cried enough. \nRUBY Well now you did. \nADA Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, it's my sweetheart. I saw him once that way, when I looked down Sally's well. So I dressed the scarecrow in the dress I wore the day he left. In case his spirit flies over looking out for me. (of the vicious looking trap) That looks terrible. \nRuby opens the sacks. \nADA Cabbages. \nRUBY I bargained like Lucifer. We can make all kinds of good eating. \nADA Such as? \nRUBY Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage soup, fried cabbage, stuffed cabbage... \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nTEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his bearing, and BOSIE. \nTEAGUE Afternoon. \nThe riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed. \nESCO Don't spread out. Why they spreading out? \nRUBY I can't get this damn thing off her. \nADA (at the well, looking down) Dear Lord in heaven. \nRUBY Ada, I can't get this off her! \nAda runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips are moving. \nRUBY What darling? What? \nShe bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada. \nRUBY She's saying don't bother. \nADA Wait! \nShe grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt. \nRuby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well. \nADA There's someone down there. I think it's Esco. \nRuby looks over at the well, then at Ada. \nRUBY This world won't stand long. God won't let it stand this way long. \nINT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY \nAn exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know where he is or how long he's been there. \nEXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY \nMaddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady. \nINMAN How long have I been sleeping? \nMADDY Not long enough. \nINMAN I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. They find me here things could be bad for you. \nMADDY What they going to do? Cut short my young life? Sit down before you fall down. \nShe calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil. \nINMAN How long you been up here? \nMADDY What year are we? '63? \nINMAN Last time I checked it was '64. \nMADDY I'd say twenty six years. \nINMAN Twenty six years! \nMADDY I could move on anytime. I've seen most of the world anyway, Richmond in the North, south almost to Charleston. You're going somewhere or you are somewhere, what's the difference? \nShe's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep. \nMADDY I've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat. I can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat. \nIn a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying. \nMADDY So you've been fighting? \nINMAN (as if he might break) I could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and I always killed him and he never killed me. \nMADDY He gave it a try, to look at you. \nINMAN I guess he did. \nMADDY See I think there's a plan. There's a design. For each and every one of us. \nDuring this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone who's done this a thousand times. \nMADDY You look at nature, a bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's got a job, seed's got a job. \nAnd the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of meat. \nINT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING \nA woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling in a pan. \nINMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in thanks, but -- doesn't look up. \nShe opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs. \nMADDY Take one of these now with your food. \nSARA I don't want it. I had my way they'd take metal altogether out of this world. Every blade, every gun. \nINMAN Is your baby sick? \nSARA He cries. I don't know. He cries a lot. My man is dead. He took his wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw his boy. \nShe never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby. \nINMAN I'm sorry. \nSARA It's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war. Man dead, woman left. \nShe hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on top. \nSARA It's mean food but it's hot. \nShe goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire. \nHe picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across. \nINMAN (ashamed of his hunger) There's no hunting on the road, just cress and -- \nHe takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby. \nSARA I need to feed this man, if you could look away. \nInman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds. \nSARA Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders took them. Made me kill our own dog on the porch. That poor creature watched over me. Nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring. I'll have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something I never did. \nINMAN I could do that for you in the morning. \nSARA I'm not asking. \nINMAN It's what I'd gladly do for you for what you're gladly doing for me. I'm Inman by the way. That's my name. \nSARA I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan. \nINMAN Glad to know you both. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nSara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm. She hands him the clothes. \nSARA You look about his size. He was another man straight up and down. \nThere's a palpable attraction between them, so that every exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge. \nSARA I don't even have a blanket. \nINMAN I got a blanket. \nSARA I'll leave you the lamp. \nBy the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nSara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen. \nSARA They fit? \nINMAN (O.S.) Pretty much. These boots are good boots. \nSARA I'll say good night. \nINMAN (O.S.) Good night. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nInman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara in there. He reluctantly settles down again. \nHE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS UNDER THE BLANKETS. \nSARA Will you come inside? \nShe stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes back inside. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nInman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence. \nSARA Could you do something for me? Do you think you could lie here, next to me, and not need to go further? \nINMAN I don't know. I'll try. \nHe sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him. \nADA That's Taurus the bull, and that's Gemini and that's Orion's big dog, Canis Major. \nRUBY Listen to her, Sal. She's turned into a highland girl. \nADA I could always name the stars, Ruby, that was never my problem. \nThey all three have linked arms. Ada imitates Stobrod. \nADA I love you darling. In case that big old sky falls on our heads. And I love you, too. Sal. \nRUBY It's sad, Sal. It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e. \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. MORNING \nAda at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL. \nEXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING \nStobrod opens the door of the Mill. The SNOW FLAKES dissuade him from venturing further. He goes back inside. \nSTOBROD (O.S.) No sense setting off in snow. \nTHE DOOR SHUTS, FIDDLE MUSIC LEAKS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED BY BANJO AND HARMONICA. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY \nSara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him: \nSARA Get out of here, quick! \nInman surfaces from deep sleep. \nSARA Federals are coming. They find you here it'll go bad on all of us. \nInman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun. \nINMAN I can try and fight them. \nSARA No, my baby. Please no! Just get. \nShe pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down onto the frosty ground. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY \nInman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look round until he's sheltered by the trees. \nFEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his shirt, shivering, then his boots. \nSara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles with him, is again knocked down. \nINMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD. \nThen Sara starts to scream. \nInman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall. \nPISTOL We got all day. \nSARA My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's shaking! Have some pity. \nA third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers them up. \nSARA I got nothing. I swear. \nNym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest. \nNYM That ain't necessarily so. \nSARA Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go inside! Take my baby inside and then we'll do whatever you want. \nNym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now leads it towards the horses. \nSARA (screaming) There's nothing! You take that hog I'm as good as dead. Cover up my boy! \nShe's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, HARD. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY \nThe door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY \nBardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby. \nBARDOLPH This is ready to get a fit going. It's shuddering. It's gone blue. \nPISTOL (to Nym) How long does he want? Hey! Leave some for the rest of us. \nSOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints. \nBosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING \nA CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire. \nPangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, frozen and covered with snow. \nGEORGIA What d'you reckon? Think we could eat this? \nSTOBROD You cook something long enough you can eat anything. \nPANGLE (prodding it) It's frozen. How long it been there for? \nSTOBROD You hungry? \nPANGLE Yeah. \nSTOBROD Not very long. \nEXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING \nTeague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nSTOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO, Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews. \nSTOBROD Edible. \nPangle takes another stick, burns his fingers. \nPANGLE Ow! \nGEORGIA (takes a bite from his skewer) Don't taste much like venison. \nPANGLE It's good. I think it's good. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nThe three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid sounds of violent nausea. \nEXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nGEORGIA IS KNEELING IN THE SNOW, his head in the snow, when he A HALF DOZEN RIDERS TROT PAST approaching the sleeping Stobrod and Pangle. Georgia has to vomit again. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nTeague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him -- Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling. Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle sleeps. \nTEAGUE Evening. Hope we didn't disturb you. \nSTOBROD You're all right. \nTEAGUE Name's Teague. Do I know you? \nSTOBROD Thewes. \nTeague slides off his horse, approaches the fire. \nTEAGUE You a deserter? -- don't mind if I just warm up at your fire. (of the sleeping Pangle) That your wife? \nSTOBROD Who? That's a he! \nTEAGUE He your wife? \nSTOBROD We're musicians. He picks the banjo, I got a fiddle. \nTEAGUE (to his men) Look pretty romantic by the fire. Don't they? (to Stobrod) Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of flesh on him. Close your eyes slip inside that shirt get two good handfuls -- dark enough I'd be willing. I'm just kidding. (to his men) Tell him, I'm just kidding. \nBOSIE He's just kidding. \nEXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nGeorgia squints through the trees. Doesn't know what to do. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nTEAGUE Did you answer my question -- about your military status? \nSTOBROD Discharged. Took a wound at Petersburg. \nTEAGUE Oh, so like a hero's discharge. \nSTOBROD I guess. \nPANGLE What'd you make of that? \nBOSIE Heartbreaking. \nTEAGUE Stand over by that tree. \nSTOBROD Me? \nTEAGUE Over by that tree. Over there. Take your boyfriend. \nStobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big old poplar. Nods at Pangle. \nSTOBROD Come on. \nPangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless. Pangle grins at Teague. \nTEAGUE Don't smile. \nPANGLE What? \nTEAGUE Quit smiling. \nSTOBROD He always smiles. He don't mean nothing by it. I told him this world's got nothing worth a smile. \nTEAGUE Put your hat over your face. \nPANGLE What do you mean? \nTEAGUE Cover your face with your hat. \nPANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING. \nEXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nGeorgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the report of each bullet. \nEXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER, calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges from the house, walks towards the bad news. \nINT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY \nRuby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion. \nADA I told Georgia he can stop here, sleep in the barn. He's got nothing inside him. He'd walk out of here and die in the snow. \nRUBY He can milk the cows. I was worrying about that. It'll be dark in a couple of hours. I's ten hours climb from here. He's drawn a map. \nADA Okay. \nRUBY (boiling) You know these fools stayed the night in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he can't do one good thing without adding the bad. Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to follow. That's a sign says shoot me! \nADA Ruby, I'm so sorry. \nAda moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is rigid. Ada stops embracing her. \nRUBY We should get going. \nShe's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve. \nRUBY Every piece of this is a man's bullshit. They call this a war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather. Then they stand in the rain and say: shit! It's raining! (tears welling) If I cry one tear for my Daddy I stole it off a crocodile. \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING \nTHE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE \nMOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the horse back and then yanking it up the other path. \nEXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT \nRuby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the entrance, the snow caught in its light. \nEXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING \nAda and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder. \nPangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him. \nAda brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head. \nADA I don't understand. \nRUBY Maybe Teague's took him. They did that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, they? -- dragged them into town, then strung them up as warning... it's snowed since, so I can't read the story on the ground. \nAda fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and the strings hang slack. \nRUBY Let's dig. \nAfter all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the ghost. \nINMAN Then I believe I made a mistake. \nHe turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, completely lost, without compass. \nINMAN If I knew where to go I'd go there. \nADA (finally recognising him) Inman? \nHe nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in their throats. Eventually -- \nADA You'd better come with me. \nAnd with that, she starts to sob, and sob. \nVERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace. \nINT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING \nAda enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod. \nADA Ruby, this is Inman. \nRuby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man. \nRUBY Congratulations, I should send you out with a shotgun more often. He looks as he needs sleep. \nINMAN I may need to. \nRUBY Be my guest. You shot or something? \nINMAN Not lately. \nRUBY Hungry? (Inman nods, Ruby to Ada) He woke up. \nADA Stobrod? \nRUBY Said -- your mommy's name was Grace then closed his eyes again. \nEXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY \nAda comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable. \nADA He's asleep. They both are. \nRUBY I'm not surprised. Your man looks played out. \nADA I saw him. I realize now. \nRUBY Saw him when? \nADA In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of trees. The man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him. \nRUBY Well there you are. \nADA Funny thing is it wasn't the same. The image. It wasn't snowing. And in the well, he was, as if he were falling. \nRUBY You probably don't remember it right. \nADA I remember it exactly. There were crows, these black crows flying towards me. I thought I was seeing him fall. Instead I was seeing him come back to me. All this while I've been packing ice around my heart. How will I make it melt? \nRUBY Better get a fire going. (goes to the fireplace) I've got big plans for that farm. Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be. \nADA I know you have. \nRUBY There's not a thing we can't do ourselves. \nINT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT \nTHE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up, steps out into the snow, her blanket around her. \nEXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT \nInman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes. \nINMAN I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet. \nADA I couldn't sleep. \nINMAN -- I got no appetite left to be in a room with wounded men. \nADA I can't see your face. \nINMAN It's not a face you recognised. \nADA Did you get my letters? \nEXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING \nA crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby. \nINMAN You go ahead. I'll follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate. \nADA We can all go together. \nINMAN It's safer this way. No one has quarrel with you. \nRUBY He's right. \nINMAN (to Ruby) I gather I need permission if I reckon on living at Black Cove. \nRuby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman gets close to Ada. \nINMAN We'll get to you by nightfall. \nADA You be safe. \nShe puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile. \nINMAN Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow. It flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow. It can wait a year, two years, I don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays its eggs on the cow. There's purpose for you. \nADA And am I the fly in this story, or the cow? \nINT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY \nRuby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey. \nSTOBROD You come up the mountain for me, darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead and gone. \nRUBY You'd have found some other fool to rescue you. \nSTOBROD He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy. \nHe coughs for a long time. \nRUBY If you say a thing and then cough it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, and don't lose him or sell him. We'll need him on the farm. \nEXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING \nAnd then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, tramping off in the snow. Inman watches. \nEXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY \nRuby and Ada walk. \nRUBY I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing to the animals. \nADA I thought you were thinking on him! \nRUBY I was not. I was thinking on swollen udders -- and before you say same difference... \nADA I'm saying nothing. \nRuby elbows her. \nRUBY Miss lovey-dovey! \nAda elbows her back. \nEXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY \nInman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT. \nInman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe of trees. \nINMAN (quietly to Stobrod) Don't look round. \nSTOBROD Got it. \nINMAN How many men does he have? \nSTOBROD There were five. You can't reason with that man. \nINMAN (takes off his gloves) I got a conversation stopper. (they're getting closer) Closer we get to that broken ground the better. \nInman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're at the edge of the trees. \nINMAN You hold on tight, do you hear? When I say three, look round, nice and slow. \nSTOBROD Okay. \nINMAN One, two, three. \nStobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. Teague waves. \n", "test1_input": "INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT \nInman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans. \nOAKLEY I'd like to hear some music while I go. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT \nInman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. It's Stobrod. \nStobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away. \nINT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT \nStobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman. \nSTOBROD What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's one I play. \nOAKLEY Play me something sweet. Like a girl's waiting for me. \nStobrod looks at Inman, confused. \nOAKLEY Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord. \nINMAN (to Stobrod) You heard him. \nSTOBROD (nervous) I only know a couple of tunes. \nOAKLEY Like when you're thirsty up at Bishop's Creek and the water is so cool. \nInman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play. \nHesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in. \nOAKLEY I'm reaching Cold Mountain before you. \nStobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away. \nINT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT \nA dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches Inman, who makes a stand. \nOFFICER Don't get up, soldier. You are mentioned tonight in my report. You are a credit to the Highlands, to North Carolina and to the Cause. \nINMAN (tight) Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer? \nOFFICER I know. A bloody day. It's what our General said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much. \nINMAN Sir. It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers. \nOFFICER Right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. There's a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between us. Stuck there from the retreat. Come daylight they can shoot us down for sport. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT \nA beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses. \nHe slithers over them. \nThey work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep. \nAs the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another. \nThe exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from the trees. \nA FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him. \nInman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK. \nHe goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them. \nEXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY \nA WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and Oakley, barely a teenager. \nBelow them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as Sally Swanger approaches. \nSALLY (to Ada, as Monroe moves off) Ada, how are you settling in? Are you liking the farm? \nADA Very much. It's beautiful country. \nSALLY So listen -- if you would say hello to one of these fools, I'll get a field cleared this weekend. \nADA Anyone? Like a forfeit? \nSALLY (pointing at Inman who immediately looks away) No. Him in particular, up in the rafters. Been pressing me all morning. \nUP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the Union. \n", "test1_true": "BUTCHER Show some respect -- these nails are making a church. \nROURKE (hammering) I call this nail: respect the church. \nAda comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Calls up to Inman. \nADA Hello. \nInman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a hole in his head. \nADA I'm Ada Monroe. \nINMAN I'm Inman. \nADA Inman? \nINMAN W. P. Inman. \nADA W. P. Inman. \nINMAN Repeating a thing doesn't improve it. (shrugs) People call me Inman. \nADA If you were to take a glass of lemonade your friends might stop staring. Inman. \nINMAN They're not my friends. \nHe drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman. \nINMAN Thank you. \nADA And what do you do? \nINMAN I work wood. Got a piece of land. Mostly work wood. \nADA Clear fields? \nINMAN (uncomfortable) I can clear a field. \nADA So, was there something in particular you wished to say to me? \nINMAN (thinks about it) Not that comes to me. (hands back the glass) I'll say thank you for the lemonade. \nAnd he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, to give him a bad time. \nROURKE Esco loves the Yankees. \nESCO I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit. \nInman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco. \nHe pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues: \nESCO What is it you think you'd be fighting for? \nROURKE The South. \nESCO And what's that when it's at home? \nEsco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other end of the building, have now arrived at the table. \nACTON Pop, you causing trouble? \nESCO No. \nELLIS That means yes. \nESCO You cut the wood, you carry the water for good old King Cotton. Now you want to fight for him. Somebody has to explain it to me. \nACTON (to Rourke and the others) Don't even try. \nThe others are desperate to tease Inman. \nBUTCHER How's the lemonade? Sweet? \nAda, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table. \nEXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT \nINMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized. \nThroughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling: \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY \n-- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look. It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over. \nSALLY That's a fine looking thing. \n", "test1_id": 2529, "test2_input": "JUNIOR -- In the clover \nVEASEY One good fart -- that'll tip over! \nThey guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes. \nVEASEY Oh God of my God! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! \nJUNIOR What's up? \nVEASEY The Israelites! The tribes of Israel are about to flee from the banks of Egypt! Hallelujah! \nINMAN (explaining to Junior) He's got a shit coming on. It's overdue. \nJUNIOR (bewildered) And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian? \nINMAN Like a Christian. \nJUNIOR Good God. \nEXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK \nThe three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare. \nJUNIOR These two boys is stopping for supper. They're on the road to Atonement. \nThe women consider the men, then disappear back inside. \nVEASEY Atonement is not a place. \nJUNIOR So what is it when it's at home? \nVEASEY Those are fine examples of the female. \nJUNIOR Take them all and leave the saw. Be a sight more use. \nSHYLA (reappearing) If they want to get in a tub there's an hour before food. \nJUNIOR They love to scrub a man. (to Shyla) Put the water on the boil. (back to the men) It's my liquor, gets their titties swinging. \nVEASEY (excited) God damn! (to Inman) I was right about sheep droppings those stools -- like rock hard. Quite astonishing. \nINT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK \nNo real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the door. \nShyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely sexual. \nSHYLA That's battered flesh. (of his neck wound) I could work a finger in there. \nVEASEY He's a hero. Took that wound at Petersburg. \nINMAN He doesn't know what I am. (uncomfortable with her stare) Thanks. \nSHYLA (to Veasey) He's shy, ain't he? \nVEASEY Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in that tub, then we'll see who's a shy one. \nSHYLA I want to poke my thumb in his holes. \nA second woman comes to the door. Dolly. \nDOLLY Lila says supper's up. \nINT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT \nLILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away. \nLILA Hey! \nJunior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey. \nJUNIOR He's gone now. Look! His eyes have gone. \nINMAN (vaguely, drunk) What? \nVEASEY Dolly? \nDOLLY S'me. \nVEASEY Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a poem. That's a poem. \nHe begins to recite, has a verse in his mind. \nVEASEY Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae (but he can' t summon it) Da-da da-da da-da dae... (vague) ...there's a poem there. \nJUNIOR I'm leaving soon as I'm full. \n", "test2_true": "JUNIOR Got a bunch of traps needs visiting. I'll be back tomorrow, before dark. You'll still be here? \nVEASEY That's my fervent prayer. \nJUNIOR My house is your house. \nINMAN (suddenly) Like to wash their hands and pray. \nVEASEY Say again? \nINMAN Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. \nVEASEY That's Job. Don't say much but even liquored up there's a preacher in him. \nInman gets up suddenly, sways. \nINMAN I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset. (head spinning) I'll just quickly lie down. \nAnd he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls up. \nVEASEY I'm heading for that smokehouse and I'm ready to be washed clean of my dirt. \nHe gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of the smokehouse. \nJUNIOR You go tend to him. (to Lila) I'll be seeing you. \nHe picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children and herding them out. \nDOLLY Come on you -- get! \nShyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by the fire. \nLILA He's mine. You can go rub yourself off on the Preacher. (of Inman) Gonna make him hug me till I grunt. \nLila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing field. \nThen she bends over the prostrate Inman. \nLILA Hey! \nInman stirs, glazed. \nLILA (kneeling down to him) You want to see what Mamma's got for you? \nSHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST. \nInman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her legs. She's naked. \nLILA That's good. Ain't that sweet? \nSHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN THE AIR. \nLILA You just get on and ride me all the way to China. \nHe doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns. \nLILA You shy? You need a hand? (goes to his buttons) Let's have a look see what we can muster. \nShe's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN. \nAs Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, knocking her over. \nJUNIOR You little bitch! Look at you! Cover yourself up! \nNEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles. \nAND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM. \nINT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT \nLila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams: \nVEASEY I had a special prayer you'd come visit. \nTHREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED. \nEXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT \nVeasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain. \nEXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY \nRuby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to decode who it is under the clothes, the hats. \nSALLY Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at you both! \nRUBY Look at us both what? \n", "test2_id": 2530, "test3_input": "RUBY Just so's you know -- you're not eating inside. Number One -- they hang people round here for taking in deserters. Number two -- even if they gave out prizes -- you'd still eat outside. \nSTOBROD You're scarred. \nRUBY I'm what? \nSTOBROD Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to you. \nRUBY You'd be scarred. You'd be really scarred if I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sacking. Which was her idea. \nSTOBROD I hurt you. \nRUBY Good God! \nSTOBROD I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the eyes that sparkle. \nRUBY Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you abandoned me, you ignored me, you beat me some more -- all of that is better than Ruby with the eyes that sparkle! \nSTOBROD I'm changed. People change. War changes people something terrible. (to Ada) Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt -- I wasn't always the best... \nRUBY You were an asshole. \nSTOBROD I can't disagree with that. I was. \nRUBY Get him out of here! \nSTOBROD Music's changed me. I'm full of music, darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's got a little snake's rattle in the body -- took it off a dead federal in Virginia. That's a beautiful fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. Don't know if it's from that little rattle locked up in it, or from something untied my heart. \nRuby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth. \nRUBY You're all set. \nSTOBROD (sincerely) Bless you both. \nHe goes to the door. \nRUBY Ain't you got a proper coat? \nSTOBROD Darling, I'm fine. And you just say the word, I won't come back neither. I don't want to put either you or your mistress here in any bother. \nADA I'm not Ruby's employer. \nSTOBROD Oh, okay, who is? \nRUBY Nobody. (Stobrod digests this) I'll make up food for you, you come Sundays before it's light, I'll leave it behind the Old Frazier Mill. \nSTOBROD Do you know who really needs a coat, darling, is my partner, fat boy name of Pangle. We're hiding up in the caves and he feels the cold like a thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit him. (leaving) I love you, Ruby. In case the sky falls on our head. You're a good girl. \nAnd he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS. \nRUBY He is so full of manure, that man, we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him. \nADA So that's Stobrod Thewes. \nRUBY It is and that's the last you'll see of him. \nEXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK \nTHE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN. \nMaddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a bulging goatskin satchel. \nMADDY That's medicine and goatmeat. You're sick of both. \nINMAN I have a deal to thank you for. \nShe hands him an ancient flintlock pistol. \nMADDY And that's just for show, or -- if you can get close enough -- a wild turkey. \nShe turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan. \nEXT. WOODS. DAY \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again. \nJUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call. \nJunior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND. \nEXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes straight into the Smoke House. \nINT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing. \n", "test3_true": "THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull. \nInman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look at him. \nINT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window. \nAda, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves. \nRUBY Get on back where you came from! \nStobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away. \nEXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY \nWINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction. \nADA (V.O.) My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath \nINT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT \nAda in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights. \nADA -- a source of little visible delight, But necessary. \nRUBY She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she? She said -- whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same. You can't say that and then marry Linton. \nADA We'll find out. \nRUBY Okay. \nADA Tomorrow. \nRUBY I'm not waiting until tomorrow. \nADA Ruby, I'm falling asleep. \nShe lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep. \nRUBY Little visible delight, but necessary. I like that... \nEXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT \nDRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He stands, shivers, sodden, desolate. \nEXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nA LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus the shelter. \nThe sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach. \nCloser he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A QUILT. \nInman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow. \nINMAN I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate soldier on furlough. I have no bad intention. I need shelter and food. \nTHE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED. \nINMAN Can I at least sleep in the corn crib -- just for some shelter? I'll be on my way come morning. \nNo answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges back towards the road. \nSARA (V.O.) I've got a rifle. \nInman turns. A gap in the door appears, the figure barely seen. \nINMAN Fair enough. \nThe baby's crying behind her. \nSARA There's some beans and corn pone, all I got. You better come in. \nINT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT \nInman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite himself, is mesmerized. \nINMAN Thank you. \nSARA I'm alone here, as you can see, with my baby. I need to believe you mean no harm. \nInman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified. \nINMAN No, I mean to give it to you. \nHe turns it handle forwards and offers it to her. \n", "test3_id": 2531}

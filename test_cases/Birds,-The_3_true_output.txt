MITCH These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative. 
MELANIE I understand completely, sir. 
MITCH As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either. 
MELANIE (leading him around shop) No, of course not. 
MITCH Do you have a pair that are just friendly? 
MELANIE I think so, sir. (she looks around) Now then, let me see. 
MITCH (at the finches) Aren't these lovebirds? 
MELANIE No, sir, those are... redbirds. 
MITCH The sign says strawberry finches. 
MELANIE (airily) Yes, we call them that too. (she moves away) Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... (and stops before a cage of canaries) 
MITCH Those are canaries, Miss. (pause) Doesn't this make you feel awful? 
MELANIE (baffled) Doesn't what make me...? 
MITCH All these innocent little creatures caged up like this? 
MELANIE Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know. 
MITCH I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages? 
MELANIE Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species. 
MITCH I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season. 
MELANIE Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time. 
MITCH Are they moulting now? 
MELANIE Some of them are. 
MITCH How can you tell? 
MELANIE Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression. 
CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V. 
The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression. 
MITCH Yes, I see. (pause) About those lovebirds, Miss... 
MELANIE Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week. 
MITCH All right. (he smiles) She smiles back. 
MITCH (he waits) All right, may I see one, please? 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it. 
MELANIE (feebly) Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie. 
One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled. 
MELANIE Oh!  Ohhhhh! 
FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT 
as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all day. 
MRS. MACGRUDER What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the birds is loose! 
She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches them suspiciously. 
MITCH Shhh! Shhhh! 
He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
the canary in his hand. 
MELANIE There we are! 
MRS. MACGRUDER Oh, good! Oh, wonderful. 
FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT 
as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the door. 
MITCH (putting the canary in) Back into your gilded cage, Melanie Daniels. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
startled. 
MELANIE What did you say? 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH 
MITCH (savoring this) I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels. 
MELANIE But how... how do you know my name? 
MITCH (secretly) A little birdie told me. (he smiles politely) Good day, Miss Daniels. (he bows to Mrs. MacGruder) Madam. (he starts out) 
MELANIE Hey, wait a minute! 
She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then: 
MELANIE I don't know you. 
MITCH Ahhh, but I know you. 
MELANIE How? 
MITCH We met in court. 
MELANIE We never met in court or anyplace else. 
MITCH That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court. 
MELANIE When? 
MITCH Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window? 
MELANIE I didn't break that window! 
MITCH No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars! 
MELANIE What are you? A policeman?

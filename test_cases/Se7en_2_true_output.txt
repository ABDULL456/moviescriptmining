SOMERSET Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable.  Just ask your husband. 
MILLS No argument. 
Mills grins, but he means it.  he sips beer.  The conversation lapses into long silence.  Somerset concentrates on his plate. Tracy looks at Mills, who eats while watching the basketball game. 
TRACY (to Somerset) How long have you lived here? 
SOMERSET Too long.  Much too long. (drinks) What do you think of our fair city? 
TRACY You take the bad with the good, I suppose.  It's... it's... 
MILLS It takes time to settle in. 
Tracy looks at Mills.  Somerset can see it is a sore subject. 
SOMERSET (to Tracy) You'll get used to it pretty quickly. There are things in any big city that stand out at first.  But... 
A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD as plates begin to rattle and clatter. 
TRACY Subway train.  It's right below us/ 
The dishes clatter more.  Coffee cups clink against their saucers.  Tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it is nothing, but she is clearly bothered. 
TRACY (CONT) It'll go away in a minute. 
They wait.  The t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  The RUMBLING grows LOUDER, knocks something over in the sink.  Mills continues eating.  Somerset fiddles with his food.  The record player skips, then plays on.  The RUMBLING finally DIES DOWN, till everything is normal. 
MILLS (uncomfortable) This real estate guy... a real scum, brought us to see this place a few times.  And, it was nice enough, and the price was right.  I was thinking it was nothing, but I started to notice, he kept hurrying us along.  I mean what could it be?  Why would he only show it like five minutes at a time, before he'd hustle us out the door? 
Mills laughs, lamely. 
TRACY We found out the first night. 
Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing. 
SOMERSET I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment. 
He pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  He can't stop it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  Tracy and Mills laugh. 
MILLS (sighs) Oh, fuck. 
INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- LATER NIGHT 
The record player spins a different album, DIFFERENT MUSIC. Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  Mills and Somerset have beers. 
SOMERSET All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day. 
TRACY I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't have a television. 
Tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours. 
MILLS That's weird.  It's un-American. 
Somerset shrugs. 
MILLS (CONT) What about sports? 
SOMERSET What about them? 
Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table. 
MILLS You go to movies at least. 
SOMERSET I read.  Remember reading?  What's the last book you read, Mills? 
MILLS T.V. Guide. 
Mills laughs.  Burps.  he turns to Tracy. 
MILLS (CONT) Excuse me. (to Somerset) I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen Green Acres. 
Somerset gives a blank stare.  Tracy walks away. 
MILLS (CONT) You've never seen The Odd Couple?  The Flintstones? 
SOMERSET I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone named... Dino. 
Across the room, Tracy turns the t.v. and the record player off. She goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a word.  Somerset and Mills turn to the closed door. 
They look at each other, then sit for a time.  Somerset drinks coffee.  Mills drums his fingers on his beeper.  Big silence. 
INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT 
Mills walks up the creaky stairs.  He carries his briefcase, a six-pack and art books.  Somerset follows, reading a case file. 
MILLS We think he acted like he was delivering a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's building says he doesn't even look at anyone who goes in anymore. 
Mills opens a door to the roof -- 
EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT 
Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof.  It is a spectacular view on all sides.  Miles of city lights.  Breathtaking.  SOUNDS of the CITY reach them. 
SOMERSET No connection between the two victims? 
Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty table.  He sits in one of two lawn chairs.  Somerset sits across from him. 
SOMERSET (CONT) No witnesses of any kind? 
MILLS None.  Which I can't understand.  It's like this guy's invisible. 
SOMERSET In this city, minding your own business is a perfected science. 
Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun with an eye at its center.  He opens a book, CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS, which is full of illustrations.  He starts paging through. 
SOMERSET (CONT) At the precinct, Sunday nights, they offer a public crime prevention course. And, the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream "help" if you're in trouble.  Scream "fire." Because people don't want to get caught up in anything.  But, a fire... that's entertainment.  They come running.

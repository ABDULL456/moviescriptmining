MED. SHOT 
Featuring the threesome. 
BRUCE (to Hildy) And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here... 
BURNS Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but -- 
HILDY Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back. 
BRUCE (taking it and surveying it coldly) You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here. 
BURNS Hildy! 
HILDY All right, Walter. 
She sits down and begins to type. 
BRUCE I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station. 
HILDY Fine. 
She types away. 
BURNS (coming over to Bruce) I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you. 
BRUCE (dramatically) If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow! 
But Hildy continues typing and doesn't even get it. 
CAMERA TRUCKS WITH BURNS 
as he leads Bruce away toward door. 
BURNS I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all. 
BRUCE Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it. 
BURNS Ts! Ts! Ts! 
BRUCE And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost. 
BURNS I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like? 
BRUCE She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know. 
BURNS (nodding) That's the kind of stuff they want! 
They go out the door. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR MED. CLOSE SHOT 
as they come out. 
BURNS Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you. 
BRUCE The money? Why? 
BURNS There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around. 
BRUCE (worried) Gee! Take a look, will you? 
He hands the money to Burns. Burns looks at it carefully and hands it back. 
BURNS Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure. 
BRUCE Say, I want to be sure, too! 
INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT 
Hildy is typing furiously. Burns enters, grinning, locks the door behind him and goes to phone and picks it up. 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy. Good. Stick close. 
He turns and crosses quickly to look out the window. 
AT WINDOW 
Burns coming in to window. 
BURNS (despairingly) Now the moon's out! 
He turns away, crossing to the desk, the CAMERA TRUCKING with him. At the desk he taps three times, being answered by three taps from within. 
BURNS Fine. Three taps is me. Don't forget! You're sitting pretty, now. Got enough air? 
He raises top an inch or two and fans air in to Williams. 
BURNS Is that better? Now breathe deep! 
We hear an intake of breath from inside the desk. 
BURNS Attaboy! 
He closes the desk and turns back to the table. As he passes Hildy, who is still typing rapidly: 
BURNS (looking over her shoulder) That's the stuff! Lam it into 'em, Hildy. 
He jerks the sheet from Hildy's machine, crosses to his desk and picks up the phone. 
BURNS (into phone) Hello! Duffy, ready? Here we go! 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
reading from the page he has taken from Hildy's typewriter. 
BURNS (into phone) "In the darkest hour of the city's history --" 
INT. MAIN FLOOR CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING LONG SHOT 
At the end of the hall are glass doors through which can be seen a turmoil of activity in the street outside -- newsboys, a crowd, and a mounted policeman or two. Bruce comes down the hall, his face set and angry. As he goes, he sees a sign set over a doorway in the hall. It reads: MISSING PERSONS BUREAU. He stops and enters. 
INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSEUP BURNS AT PHONE 
BURNS (into phone) Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right. (puts receiver down on table) Duffy's getting old! 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
HILDY Where's Butch? 
BURNS' VOICE He's on the way. 
HILDY (over her typing) He'd better hurry. The boys'll be coming back to phone. 
BURNS (coming into shot to peer over her shoulder) Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!

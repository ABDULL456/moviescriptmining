Falling from the top of frame to the bottom. Pluming off into dust. White, white, white. We move toward it even as it recedes, always out of reach. Finally we pop out wide and high to reveal... \nThe white is chalk. An old BLACK GROUNDSKEEPER lays down the right field line on a baseball diamond. \n1 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - MONTAGUE ST, BROOKLYN - DAY 1 \nBlinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall: Abe Lincoln & Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization. \nCLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous. \nRICKEY Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of now, only the Board of Directors and my family know. \nSukeforth and Parrott exchange a look. \nSUKEFORTH A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey. And you always got one. \nRICKEY My wife says I'm too old, That my health isn't up to it. My son says that every one in baseball will be against me. But I'm going to do it. \nParrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey. \nSUKEFORTH Do what, Mr. Rickey? \nRICKEY I'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers. \nPARROTT With all due respect, sir, have you lost your mind? Imagine the abuse you'll take from the newspapers alone. Never mind how it'll play on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey. \nRickey looks dismissively at Parrott, over to Sukeforth. \nPINK REV 4-19-12 1A. \nRICKEY There's no law against it, Clyde. \nSUKEFORTH There's a code. Break a law and get away with it, some people think you're smart. Break an unwritten law though, you'll be an outcast. \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 2. \nRICKEY So be it.

RICKWOOD FIELD - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA - NIGHT 2 \nThe big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot, feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights. \nCATCHER Where'd you learn to move like that, runner?! At dime a dance night?! Stay quiet! INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSAFE!\u00e2\u0080\u009d A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher: \nRUNNER Is that the best you got?! Huh?! I'm going to steal nine, ten bases today! You better start counting! The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man. \nCATCHER \n(ALABAMAN) Where's your shortstop from? \nJOHN SCOTT \n(LOUISIANAN) California. \nCATCHER He's got a mouth on him. Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch, signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off again. The catcher fires to THIRD: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSafe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nRUNNER You got a rag arm, catcher! \nCATCHER Steal home! You'll find out what kind of arm I got! \nDBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3. \nRUNNER Okay, I'm coming! The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles. \nCATCHER California, huh? \n(SCOTT NODS) Well California here he goes, if he comes down here. The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing off third. Here comes the wind-up... The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides -- The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner. ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to the UMPIRE. He never heard the call. \nJACK What was I? The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes -- The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back. As the two men wrestles each other to the ground -- \nCUT TO: \n3 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - MONTAGUE ST, BROOKLYN - DAY 3 \nRickey and Sukeforth going through stacks of FILES on the desk. A black ballplayer's picture is clipped to each. As Rickey reviews one, Sukeforth tries to hand him another. \nWHITE 3-14-12 13. \nSMITH Yes, a sentimental one. I'm from Detroit. He was the Tiger shortstop when I was a boy. How about you? Who's your best? \nRICKEY Pop Lloyd. \nSMITH Not Honus Wagner? \nRICKEY Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list? \nSMITH He won't break it. He doesn't have a shortstop's arm. Robinson belongs on second base. \nRICKEY Alright then, where would he rate at second? \nSMITH If he was playing now he'd be the best second baseman in the majors. \nRICKEY High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first. \nSMITH What are you saying, Mr. Rickey? \nRICKEY I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again. \nSMITH Daytona Beach? \n(RICKEY NODS) You're aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in Madison, Florida and a black man down in Live Oaks? \nRICKEY Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona. \nWHITE 3-14-12 14. \nSMITH Live Oaks is 150 actually. \nRICKEY I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He assures me there'll be no trouble. But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other. \nRICKEY (CONT'D) Mr. Smith, are you a Communist? \nSMITH I'm a Democrat. Why do you ask? \nRICKEY I have a business proposition. What's your salary at the Courier? \nSMITH Fifty dollars a week. \nRICKEY I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc... \nSMITH What's in it for me? Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation? \nRICKEY Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate. What do you say, Mr. Smith? \nSMITH I say yes, sir. If a Negro is good enough to stop a Nazi bullet in France; he's good enough to stop a line drive at Yankee Stadium. \nRICKEY Ebbets Field actually, but yes, I agree.

BALLROOM - THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - NIGHT 14 \nOver 500 guests: journalists, players and politicians all listen politely as a SPEECH drones to an end. INSERT: New York City. 23rd Annual Baseball Writer's Association Dinner February 3, 1946. \nSPEAKER As our former President Herbert Hoover remarked in his tribute to our national pastime: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The rigid voluntary rules of right and wrong, as applied in baseball, are second only to religion in strengthening the morals of the American people.' Polite applause as the speaker steps off. The clapping more enthusiastic as the lights dim on all but an impromptu set: plantation house columns. Hoots as a BUTLER appears wearing satin knee breeches and a MONTREAL ROYALS jersey. He holds a ring like a lawn jockey, a WHITE MAN in BLACK FACE. The laughs get louder as he peers out with exaggerated wide eyes. \nBUTLER Lordy, lordy, it's looking like da massa will be late dis ebning. As the LAUGHS from the audience subside, a sportswriter dressed as a COLONEL enters from stage right. \nCOLONEL Robbie! Robbie! \nBUTLER Yassuh, Massa Kunl. Here Ah is. Huge LAUGHS as he struts and dances his way over. \nWHITE 3-14-12 16. \nCOLONEL Jackie, you woolly headed rascal. How long yo' been in the family? \nBUTLER Ebber since Massa Rickey done bots me from da Kansas City Monarchs. \nCOLONEL (aside to audience) Rickey that no good carpetbagger! What could he be thinking! Huge LAUGHS from that one. Two people enjoying it we'll recognize later as HERB PENNOCK and BOB COOKE. \nBUTLER Ah came near bein' killed last night, Kunl. \nCOLONEL How's that, Jackie boy? \nBUTLER Ah was comin' up a dark street and three men was behind me. And they tried to do me with a baseball bat. \nCOLONEL You don't say? \nBUTLER Yes, suh. Ah recognized one of dem. Ah'm gonna hab him arrested. \nCUT TO: \n33 INT. STAIRWAY - THE HARRIS HOUSE - DAY 33 \nMRS. HARRIS leads Jack and Rachel up the stairs to a door at the top. Mrs. Harris opens it. \nMRS. HARRIS I call this the love nest. I hope you like it. \nRACHEL I'm sure. Thank you. As Jack enters, Mrs. Harris starts back down. \nMRS. HARRIS Dinner's at five. Rachel enters, closes the door behind her -- \n34 LOVE NEST 34 -- And accidentally knocks Jack onto the bed. She lands on top of him. The room is impossibly small. It barely holds their luggage and the BED they're on. As they look around: \nJACK It's a joke, right? \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 26. \nRACHEL I like it. The love nest. She kisses him. He's starting to like it, too. \nRACHEL Remind me dinner's at five. \nJACK I'll try to remember... As the kisses become more urgent... \nCUT TO: \nA35 INT. SMITH'S BUICK - DAYTONA TRAINING FACILITY - DAY A35 \nSmith pulls up alongside the team buses, looks across at Jack who is just a little nervous. \nSMITH The first day of Spring Training. My Pittsburgh Courier readers need to know how it feels. \nJACK It's okay. \nSMITH That's not exactly a headline. \nJACK \n(BRUSQUE) That's all I got. \nSMITH Look, Jack, right now it's just me asking you. But you get on that field and it's going to be the New York Times and the Sporting News. You should think about it. \nJACK If they ask something, I'll answer. \nSMITH Alright, but you know when you're at the plate, you want to feel like you see the pitch come in slow? Well, you want to see the questions come in slow, too. Jack just looks at him. Gets out. Smith sighs. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 26A. \n35 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DODGERS DAYTONA FACILITY - DAY 35 \nAs PLAYERS (Brooklyn, St. Paul & Montreal) warm up, practice, Rickey sits on the bench, angry as he reads a NEWSPAPER. Harold Parrott hurries over, something urgent on his mind. Rickey on a rant; Parrott can't get a word in. \nRICKEY Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - broadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race, then I know the latter needs a bodyguard. (Parrott tries to \nINTERJECT) It is those of the carpetbagger stripe of the white race - me again - who under the guise of helping, in truth are using the Negro for their own selfish interest, thereby retarding the race! Parrott tries to interrupt again, but Rickey is furious. \nRICKEY The minor league commissioner of baseball said that! I pay part of his salary! You wouldn't stab me in the back like this, would you? \nPARROTT \n(FINALLY) He's here, Mr. Rickey. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 27. \nRICKEY Why didn't you say so?! \n36 PLAYING FIELD 36 Jack crossing toward them in his Montreal Monarchs uniform carrying a glove and a bat. 200 white players clocking him. He's surrounded by REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. It's the cue for most of the batting and fielding and chatter among the Dodgers, Royals and Saints to come to a stop. Higbe forgets Bragan is throwing him a ball. It clocks him in the chest. Reese and Stanky passing a medicine ball. \nREESE That's him, huh? \nSTANKY Take a wild guess. Flash bulbs go off in Jack's face. Questions like punches. Shouts of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jackie' and then... \nREPORTER ONE Jackie, do you think you can make it with these white boys? Jack looks off to where Smith watches, back to the reporter. See the questions slow. He answers with measure. \nJACK Sure, I had no problem with white men in the service or at UCLA. \nREPORTER TWO What'll you do if one of these pitchers throws at your head? \nJACK (thinks a beat) I'll duck. That gets some laughs. \nREPORTER THREE Jack, what's your natural position? \nROBINSON I've been playing shortstop. \nREPORTER THREE Are you after Pee Wee Reese's job? \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 27A. Jack looks over to where Reese watches with Stanky. \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 31. The MAN on first takes a lead. \nRICKEY To treat him as they would any other teammate. \nHOPPER Uh huh. \nRICKEY To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves. To all work together in harmony. WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground. He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first. \u00c2  Rickey is astounded. \nRICKEY That was superhuman. \nHOPPER \n(CHUCKLING) Superhuman? Don't get carried away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a Nigger out there. Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally... \nRICKEY Clay, I realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so I will let it pass. But I will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed. They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them. \nHOPPER Attaboy, Jackie! Way to turn two! \nCUT TO: \n40 EXT. FRONT PORCH - THE BROCK HOUSE - SANFORD - NIGHT 40 \nSmith and Mr. Brock are sitting on the porch sipping rum and cokes. A quiet evening. \nDBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 32. \nMR. BROCK I hope Jackie sleeps alright. Chasing baseballs in the sun all day, I'd be in my grave. How are they treating him out there? They watch as a CAR slows, parks across the street. \nSMITH Okay as far as I can see. A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MAN, LUTHER exits the car and starts toward them. \nMR. BROCK \n(FROWNS) You find good people every place you go. Even here in Florida... \nLUTHER \n(STOPPING BELOW) Is he in there? \nSMITH Who is it you're looking for? \nLUTHER Nigra ball player. The air suddenly alive with danger. \nSMITH He's asleep. Maybe you better come back in the morning. \nLUTHER I ain't comin' back. Other fellas is comin'. They ain't too happy about him stayin' here in Sanford. Playin' ball with white boys. (a long beat) Skedaddle, that's what I'd do. If'n they get here, and he's still here, there's gonna be trouble. He turns and walks away. As they watch, a phone rings... \nRICKEY'S VOICE Yes, Wendell, what is it? \nCUT TO: \n41 INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAYTONA BEACH - NIGHT 41 \nRickey in his pajamas in his hotel room. On the phone. \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 33. \nRICKEY I see... Yes, I understand. Wake him up and get him out of there. Put him in the car and start driving for Daytona Beach. Now. And, Wendell, under no circumstance tell him what this is about. I do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight. \nCUT TO: \n42 INT. BEDROOM - MR. BROCK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 42 \nHalf dressed, Jack sits on the edge of his bed, feeling bad. Through his open door, across a hall, we can see Smith in his room. Passing in and out of view packing his own things. \nJACK I was just getting loose. Smith sticks his head in the door. \nSMITH Don't just sit there. Pack your duds. We're blowin'. A phone RINGS somewhere. They hear Brock answer, then: \nMR. BROCK'S VOICE Wendell?! Smith leaves the room. Hold on Jack, despair as he listens. \nSMITH'S VOICE Yes, Mr. Rickey, I'm with him now... We're pulling out for Daytona in five minutes, soon as he gets his bag packed... Yes, yes, it's just one of those things. \u00e2\u0080\u0098One of those things.' As Jack's head hangs a little lower. \nCUT TO: \n43 INT./EXT. BUICK - MAIN STREET - SANFORD - NIGHT 43 \nThe street deserted, sidewalks rolled up. Jack angry and silent in the passenger seat. Smith jumpy behind the wheel. They stop as a PICK-UP stops ahead outside a BAR where: A DOZEN WHITE MEN in shirtsleeves exchange words with the boys in the truck. To Jack it looks like a typical small town bull session. To Smith it looks like something else. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 34. The white men look over at the two black men. One steps over, motions: roll down the window. \nJACK I wonder what he wants? \nSMITH To run us out of town. \nJACK What are you talking about? The man close now. As Jack cranks down the window, Smith floors it. The Buick SCREECHES away, SWERVING around a CAR coming the other way. \nJACK What the hell, Wendell?! \nRICKEY Watching from a seat behind third. \nRICKEY Thataway, Jackie! Thataway! \nHIGBE & JACK Higbe looks home for the sign, Jack dancing off third, pounding his right foot toward home. He feints hard home. Higbe steps off the rubber. Jack stays where he is. \nHIGBE Hell! You're supposed to go back to third when I step off! Don't you know nothing?! He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His movements carry violence within them. Like a piston exploding in an engine. Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack home. Higbe is furious. \nED CHARLES - IN THE COLORED SECTION CHEERING, joyous. His mother joins in, happy despite... \nMOTHER I don't understand. What happened? \nED It's a balk, Mama. The pitcher can't start toward home and then stop. Jackie scores. \nGREEN REV 4-27-12 39. \nMOTHER But he didn't do anything. \nED Oh, mama, yes he did, he discombobulated the man. \nDUGOUT Durocher looks to Branca, impressed. \nDUROCHER He didn't come to play; he came to kill. Durocher starts out to the mound to talk to Higbe. \nDIXIE WALKER Watching from right field, the black crowd still cheering. He walks over toward the open bullpen where Casey stands. \nWALKER This really how it's gonna be some day? Baseball? \nCUT TO: \n50 EXT. SCOREBOARD - BALLFIELD - DAY 50 \nMontreal vs. Indianapolis. THE STANDS are half filled. The COLORED SECTION is packed solid, accentuated by the many empty seats in the sections on either side of it. INSERT: De Land, Florida. No score, top of the first as -- Jack drops a BUNT down the line. The FIRST BASEMAN fields, throw to the SECOND BASEMAN covering. Too late. Only Jack doesn't stop. Realizing the SHORTSTOP isn't covering the bag, Jack bolts for second. The second baseman has to wait on the throw and when he makes it -- The UMPIRE signals safe. A bunt double! Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box. The pitch. Crack, Jorgensen laces a single to left. Jack motors to third where Sukeforth is WAVING him home. We're with him at hip level as he tears down the basepath. The CATCHER bracing for the throw - they COLLIDE - he's SAFE! As Jack gets to his feet, however, a Jim Crow POLICEMAN steps up to meet him, grabs him by the shoulder. \nPOLICEMAN Git offa this field now! \nWHITE 3-14-12 40. \nJACK What!? Why? \nPOLICEMAN It's against the law is why. No niggers don't play with no white boys. Git off or go to jail. Jack shrugs the policeman's hand off his shoulder. That sends him reaching for his nightstick and -- Sukeforth is there to get between them. \nJACK You swing that thing you better hit me between the eyes with it. \nPOLICEMAN Is that so? The CROWD BOOING. The black section especially. \nHOPPER (arrives from dugout) Hey, hold on, what'd he do wrong? \nPOLICEMAN We ain't havin' Nigras mix with white boys in this town. Ya'll ain't up-states now; they gotta stay separate. Brooklyn Dodgers ain't changing our way of living. Where are you all from anyhow? \nHOPPER Greenwood, Mississippi. \nPOLICEMAN Hell, man, you oughta know better. (a dangerous beat) Now tell your Nigra I said to git. You think I'm foolin'?

He's going to kiss her. \nJACK You're not getting away from me. \nRACHEL \n(LOOKING PAST) Jack... A white man bee-lines them from across the street, looks like a real CRACKER. Jack on guard, gets in front of Rachel. \nJACK Get back, Rae. Go back. Cracker stops square across from him. Jack's fists balled. \nCRACKER I want you to know something. \nJACK Yeah, what's that? \nCRACKER I want you to know I'm pulling for you to make good. And a lot of folks here feel the same way. If a man's got the goods, he deserves a fair chance. That's all. (tips his hat) Ma'am. As Cracker walks away... Rachel takes Jack's hand. \nCUT TO: \nRachel exits looking stricken. She steps over, splashes a little water from the sink up into her face. An OLDER BLACK WOMAN watches sympathetically. \nOLDER WOMAN Are you alright, honey? \nRACHEL I'm sick. I don't know why. The older woman rolls off a piece of paper towel for her. \nRACHEL (CONT'D) Thank you. \nOLDER WOMAN When did you have your monthly last? \nWHITE 3-14-12 45. Rachel looks over, taken aback.

Come on, batter. \n60 RACHEL 60 Emerging up the runway. The field opening up before her. There's Jack standing down there. The sight of him settles her. As she puts a hand gently over her belly... \n61 THE PITCHER 61 Grimaces for something extra as he fires a high fastball -- Jack UNLOADS. All heads turn to watch it sail -- high into the left field bleachers, banging hard off the scoreboard. \n62 SMITH 62 Nearly drops his typewriter, pushes his hat back as he watches Jack start his home run trot. Smith laughs. Joy. \n63 DUGOUT 63 Hopper can't believe his eyes. Softly to himself: \nHOPPER I'll be damned... \nWHITE 3-14-12 46. \n64 WE'RE WITH JACK 64 As he runs the base paths.

Boys from impoverished parts of the country? \nDUROCHER It - ain't - gonna - happen. \nRICKEY You really believe they won't accept him? Once they see how he plays, how he can help them win. \nDUROCHER I'm not saying they won't accept him: I'm saying they won't ask for him. I'm saying Robinson's good medicine, but they're not gonna like the taste. I'm saying bend over, boys, and get ready, this one might hurt a little. \n(ANOTHER FORKFUL) Boy, this is good fish. \nCUT TO: \n75 KIRBY HIGBE - IN HIS TIVOLI HOTEL ROOM 75 As Higbe (South Carolina) finishes WRITING something on a piece of hotel STATIONARY, Bragan (Alabama) looks to Dixie Walker (Alabama) and Dodger pitcher HUGH CASEY (Georgia). \nBRAGAN Why do you think Rickey's got us playing spring games in Panama? \n(MORE) \nBLUE REV 4-07-12 53. \nBRAGAN (CONT'D) He wants to get us used to Negro crowds. He wants more of them than us. He's hoping it'll get us more comfortable being around Robinson. Higbe clears his throat, reads what he's written: \nHIGBE We, the undersigned Brooklyn Dodgers will not play ball on the same field as Jackie Robinson. Higbe signs it. He hands the pen to Bragan who adds his own name. Casey signs with a flourish. Casey holds out the pen to Walker who doesn't take it right away. An odd beat. \nCASEY If you wanna make your mark, Dixie, we can witness it. Everyone laughs; it loosens Walker up enough to sign. \nCUT TO: \n76 HOTEL ROOM DOOR 76 Higbe KNOCKS as Casey, Bragan and Walker crowd behind him. \nSTANKY'S VOICE C'mon in! \nSTANKY'S ROOM The boys enter.

Brooklyn's got a solid second baseman. And they got Pee Wee Reese at short. But first base is up for grabs. Are you catching my drift? \nJACK \n(NODS) Yeah. I don't need a glove to do that. \nCUT TO: \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 58. \n85 OMITTED 85 \n86 JACK - PRACTICE FIELD 86 Coach Sukeforth, getting balls from a bucket, hitting grounders down to Jack at first.

As Jack struggles... \nPANAMANIAN KID El es muy malo. \nSUKEFORTH Mr. Rickey said he wants you playing conspicuous baseball! \n(WHACK) To be so good the Dodgers'll demand you on the team! \n(WHACK) So I thought about it awhile and then I looked up conspicuous in the dictionary. \n(WHACK) It means to attract notice or attention.

Are you really here to tell me you don't want to play with Robinson? \nBRAGAN Yes, Sir. My friends back in Birmingham would never forgive me. \nRICKEY And your friends here in Brooklyn? (Bragan just shrugs) Then I will accommodate you. If you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until I can work out a trade. That gets Bragan's goat.

You can go, Bragan. \nCUT TO: \n89A SECOND BASE - PANAMA - DAY 89A Time slowed way down as Jack takes a throw at second from the Montreal shortstop.

Hope you can respect that, sir. \nRICKEY I realize, Dixie, that you have a Southern upbringing, that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture. I for one would deeply appreciate it. I think we can all learn something. \nWALKER What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a hardware store back home. It's called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't come because I have the lowest prices, they come because it's called Dixie Walker's. Understand?

Rickey switches the phone from one ear to the other. \nRICKEY I'm sorry, Happy, I thought you said lose Durocher for a year. \nHAPPY Yes. He was seen in Havana with known gamblers. \nRICKEY Anyone who sets foot in Havana is seen with known gamblers. \nHAPPY It's not just one thing, it's an accumulation. I received notice today from the Catholic Youth Organization. Vowing a ban on baseball unless Durocher is punished for his moral looseness. \nRICKEY You're joking. \nHAPPY It's this business with the actress in California. She's recently divorced and Durocher is the cause. They may even be illegally married. \nPINK REV 4-19-12 65. \nRICKEY Now I'm sure you're joking. Happy checks his nails, returns his hand to the MANICURIST. \nHAPPY I wish I were. The CYO buy a lot of tickets, Branch. They draw a lot of water and I can't afford to ruffle their feathers. Am I mixing metaphors there? \nRICKEY You know very well my organization is about to enter a tempest. I need Durocher at the rudder. He's the only man who can handle this much trouble, who loves it in fact. You're chopping off my right hand! \nHAPPY I have no choice. I'm going to have to sit your manager, Branch. Leo Durocher is suspended from baseball for a year. \nRICKEY You can't do that! Happy, you son of a bitch! DIAL TONE. Rickey steadies himself, looks to Parrott. \nRICKEY Trouble ahead, Harold.

Jack nods, unbuttoning his shirt... Stanky is suddenly there. All pugnacity as he gives up 4 inches and 40 pounds to Jack. \nSTANKY You're putting on that uniform, it means you're on my team. But before I play with you I want you to know how I feel about it. I want you to know I don't like it. I want you to know I don't like you. Jack regards him. Stanky doesn't flinch.

If you were a white boy, you know where you'd be right now?! On a bus headed down to Newport News cuz you can't play for shit! Here comes the pitch. Jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out, pokes a soft hit past second. A nothing hit, but he's standing on first. And he looks, well, ferocious in fact. As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box... Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an insolent, in-your-face lead off first. Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe! Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes. \n135 RED BARBER 135 Up in the booth. \nBARBER Two strikes now to Reiser as Leonard looks in.

Walker says to no one in particular, but loud enough for Jack to hear: \nWALKER Maybe 42's got enough friends in town, we can bunk up. \nJACK What's that supposed to mean? \nWALKER Nothing. It's just, I know when you can't get into a hotel, you got people's houses you can stay at. \nJACK What do you want from me, Walker? \nWALKER An apology. \nJACK \n(STEPS FORWARD) For what? Places like this? Parrott alarmed at this turn of events. \nWALKER For turning this season into a sideshow! I'm a ballplayer; I want to play ball! \nJACK So am I!

BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - BROOKLYN - DAY 164 \nRickey looks up as Reese enters. He holds a LETTER. \nRICKEY What can I do for you, Pee Wee? \nREESE Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this, the series in Cincinnati next week. \nRICKEY It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first. \nREESE Yes, sir. You know, I'm from Kentucky. \nRICKEY Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you. \nREESE I got this letter, sir. I guess some people aren't too happy about me playing with Robinson. Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the letter, scans it, reads the highlights... \nRICKEY Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We will get you, carpetbagger. (holds it out) Typical stuff. Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt. \nREESE It's not typical to me. \nRICKEY How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee? \nREESE Just this. Ain't that enough? Rickey looks Reese over a moment. Pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet. \nWHITE 3-14-12 101. Motioning Reese to join him, he pulls open a drawer, pulls out a 4-inch stack of flattened letters, then another, then a third. He looks to Reese. \nREESE (CONT'D) What are those? \nRICKEY I'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club. Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads: \nREESE Get out of baseball, or your baby boy will die. \n(NEXT ONE) Quit baseball or your Nigger wife will be... Reese trails off, won't say it out loud. Skips to another. \nREESE (CONT'D) Get out of the game or be killed. He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked. \nREESE (CONT'D) Does Jackie know? \nRICKEY Of course he knows. And the FBI. They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously. So excuse me if I'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger. You should be proud of it! \nREESE We'd just like to play ball, Mr. Rickey. That's all we want to do. \nRICKEY I understand. I bet Jackie just wants to play ball. I bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch. I bet he wishes people didn't want to kill him. But the world isn't so simple anymore. I'm not sure it ever was. We just, baseball ignored it. Now we can't. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 102. \nREESE \n(QUIET) Yes, Sir.

At short, Reese receives the ball, moves to throw to first when he pauses. Deciding, he suddenly moves to trot across the diamond until he's alongside Jack. \nJACK What's up? Now cries of CARPETBAGGER! cut through. PEE WEE, HOW CAN YOU PLAY WITH THIS BLACK BASTARD!? Reese stares up at the worst hecklers along the first base line. He looks a little sad. \nREESE They can say what they want; we're here to play baseball. \nJACK Just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the Civil War. \nREESE Hell, we'd a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out. We just ran out of ammunition. Jack laughs. Reese has a funny way of saying it. \nJACK Better luck next time, Pee Wee. Reese impulsively puts his arm around Jack's shoulder, stares into the Cincy dugout. \nREESE Ain't gonna be a next time. All we got is right now. This right here. Know what I mean? Walker reacting out in right. The crowd shuts down, some in shock at the gesture. Jack surprised also. \nREESE (CONT'D) Thank you, Jackie. \nJACK What're you thanking me for? \nREESE I've got family here from Louisville. Up there somewhere.

SCHOENDIENST has the sense to vacate before he gets there. \nJACK Bouncing up and down, wearing that badge of potential violence and action. The crowd buzzing, the electricity practically hits you in the face. Jack's going to score. \nRICKEY Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him. \nJACK Walker at bat. Jack steps out, checks on MARION the shortstop. He takes another step out, looks to Schoendienst. \nRED BARBER (over it all) Munger sets. Robbie back and forth off second. The third bag clearly in his sights. Oh, and Munger deals a pick off throw to Marion at second and Robinson is out! Marion breaks for the bag and Munger turns and fires a strike. Marion brings down the tag -- Out! He is and he knows it. The crowd stunned into silence. Jack frozen a moment, head down, furious with himself. Low. \nBARBER'S VOICE The Cardinals pick up a game. It was one of those plays where you do or you don't and Jackie didn't. \nCUT TO: \n176 INT. TRAINER'S TABLE - DODGER CLUBHOUSE - DAY 176 \nJack on his stomach as STITCHES are sewn into his leg.

The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches. \nRICKEY Sticking up for yourself is what you'd expect of any man. Some find it galling to see it in a Negro. \nJACK I'm sorry, Mr. Rickey. \nRICKEY Sorry? Sorry for what? \nJACK I lost my cool out there. It probably cost us the game. \nRICKEY I told you, Jackie, all the best base runners get caught sometimes. \nJACK I wasn't thinking. Rickey pulls up a chair sits across from him, leans in. \nRICKEY Do you know what I saw this morning? I was passing a sandlot and a little white boy was up to bat. You know what he was doing? \nJACK Sitting on a fastball? \nRICKEY He was pretending he was you. Wiping his hands on his pants, swinging with his arms outstretched like you do.

Come on now. A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away. \nRICKEY I love this game. I love baseball. I've given my life to it. Forty odd years ago I was a player coach at Ohio Wesleyan University. We had a Negro catcher, best hitter on the team. Charley Thomas. Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands. \nRICKEY A fine young man. I saw him laid low. Broken because of the color of his skin and I didn't do enough to help. I told myself I did, but I didn't. The game I loved had something unfair at the heart of it. I ignored it. But a time came when I could no longer do that. \n(LOOKS UP) You let me love baseball again. Thank you. Jack's eyes gentle on Rickey's. \nJACK You're welcome. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 110. Rickey fighting back tears now, retreats to his more confident self. \nRICKEY You're a force of nature, Jackie, you've complicated everything but yourself. You're changing the world, and refusing to let it change you. I for one am in awe. Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they consider each other.

Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance. \nRICKEY (CONT'D) Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side. You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher. Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him. \nJACK Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League. That doesn't make sense to me. \nMR. RICKEY It doesn't, huh? Are you calling us liars, Jack? \nJACK What's this about, Mr. Rickey? \nRICKEY This is about baseball. Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal. \nRICKEY (CONT'D) I see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal. If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers. The white Brooklyn Dodgers.

I have a pile of scouting reports. I know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch. The question is can you control your temper? \nJACK My temper? \nRICKEY Yes your temper!

Answer me, you black sonofabitch! \nJACK \n(MASTERS HIMSELF) Do you want a ballplayer who doesn't have the guts to fight back? Is that what you want? \nRICKEY I want one who has the guts not to fight back! There are people who will not like this. They will do anything to get you to react. If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong. Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground. We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else. We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer. Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek. Jack considers Rickey.

(tips his hat) Mrs. Robinson. \nRACHEL It's Rachel. \nSMITH Man, you two look wiped out. \nJACK \n(SHARP) You got a car? Get us out of here. \nCUT AHEAD TO: \n31 EXT. SMITH'S BUICK (PARKED) - DAY 31 \nJack and Smith carry the luggage. Smith's excited being around Jack even if he is grumpy. As Smith unlocks the Buick, Rachel considers a segregated pair of water fountains. \nSMITH You ever been down South before, Rachel? \nRACHEL First time. We have our problems in Pasadena, but not like this. \nSMITH Mr. Rickey says we follow the law. If Jim Crow and the state of Florida say Negroes do this and that, then we do this and that. \nRACHEL \n(SOFTLY) My life's changing right in front of me. Who I am, who I think I am. \nCUT TO: \n32 EXT. THE HARRIS HOUSE - DAYTONA BEACH - DAY 32 \nBlack neighborhood. The Buick stops at a nice looking house. \nSMITH Joe and Duff Harris live here. He gets out the black vote, does a lot of good for colored folks. \n(MORE) \nYELLOW REV 4-24-12 25. \nSMITH (CONT'D) Mr. Rickey set it up himself. \n(IMITATES RICKEY) If we can't put the Robinsons in the hotels, they should stay some- place that represents something. Jack and Rachel exchange a look, the place seems nice. \nSMITH Brooklyn plays downtown; Montreal a few blocks from here. You'll stay with the Harrises except for a few days at the end of the week. The whole Dodger organization is going to Sanford, about 45 minute away. You'll stay here though, Rachel. \nRACHEL Where are the other wives staying? \nSMITH There are no other wives. You're the only one Mr. Rickey allowed to spring training. As the HARRISES step out on the porch, wave hello... \n", "test2_id": 1732, "test3_input": "STANKY You're the problem, you goddamn disgrace! What kind of man are you?! You know he can't fight! Pick on someone who can fight! \nBARBER'S VOICE \n(OVER IT) Eddie Stanky having a chin wag with his ex-teammate Chapman. Both men masters of distraction. Eddie, of course, from second. Chapman from the dugout. Stanky so mad he can't see straight. Chapman surrenders. \nCHAPMAN Okay, okay. Jesus. As Chapman disappears into his dugout, Jack whacks a single. \nCUT TO: \n143 EXT. DODGER DUGOUT - DAY 143 \nStanky sits here stewing. His head down. \nBARBER'S VOICE Robinson on first, Pete Reiser at bat. Reiser belts it. A long one. Deep into left center. Back goes Ennis who is not tall enough. This one's off the wall. Robinson is going to score from first. Over Barber: a CRACK of the bat, the ROAR of the crowd. As players around him react, Stanky finally looks up as Robinson crosses the plate, heads in, sits a few feet from Stanky. \nJACK Thanks. \nSTANKY For what? You're on my team. What the hell am I supposed to do? \n(SOFTLY) I gotta look in the mirror, too. \nPINK REV 4-19-12 86A. Stanky stands, walks away. Today's gonna be okay. \nCUT TO: \n144 INT. BLACK CHURCH - BROOKLYN - DAY 144 \nA BLACK PREACHER leads his congregation in prayer. \nPREACHER Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, let me sow pardon. Where there is darkness, let me sow light. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Amens'. We see Rickey sits in the back row, the day heavy on him. A YOUNG GIRL turns, looks at him. Why's a white man here? Rickey smiles, puts a finger to his lips... Shhhh. \nCUT TO: \nSALMON REV 6-4-12 87. \n144A OMITTED 144A \n144B OMITTED 144B \n144C OMITTED 144C \n144D OMITTED 144D \nSALMON REV 6-4-12 87A. \n145 INT. LOCKER ROOM - EBBETS FIELD - DAY 145 \nPlayers put on their uniforms as Higbe, in street clothes, fires the contents of his locker into a cardboard box. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 87B. \nHIGBE I speak my mind and they trade me! This ain't the America I know! He glares down to Jack's locker. Jack regards him back. It's Higbe who looks away first. He continues packing. \nWALKER Where are they sending you, Hig? \nHIGBE Pittsburgh! For cash and some I- talian outfielder named Gionfriddo! \n(CONSIDER HIS \nJOCKSTRAP) Pittsburgh... \nCUT TO: \n146 EXT. EBBETS FIELD - DAY 146 \nDixie Walker takes batting practice, drives the ball all over the field. A natural. Rickey and Shotton watch from behind the backstop. \nRICKEY Do you remember the story, Burt, of the 99 sheep? How one was missing? \nSHOTTON If you're talking about Dixie, I'd leave the word sheep out of it. \nRICKEY I find myself at odds. I want integration and the pennant. I want to punish Dixie and at the same time I want his salvation. \nSHOTTON Can't he just be a good ballplayer? He has to be a good person, too? \nRICKEY It would be so much simpler if he wasn't batting .385. As Walker finishes, he passes Jack whose turn it is. \nWALKER She's all yours, Robinson. As THUNDER rumbles in the distance... \nCUT TO: \nTAN REV 6-25-12 88. \n147 OMITTED 147 \n147A INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - BROOKLYN - DAY 147A \n", "test3_true": "PARROTT The news isn't good, sir. \nRICKEY Nevertheless it must be accepted calmly, Harold. What is it? A headline: PLAYERS STRIKE. Parrott reads... \nPARROTT A National League players' strike instigated by some of the St. Louis Cardinals against the presence of Negro first baseman Jackie Robinson has been averted temporarily and perhaps permanently quashed. \nRICKEY Madness! What are they thinking?! \nCUT TO: \n148 EXT. MANHATTAN HOTEL - DAY 148 \nWendell Smith waits under an umbrella as the CARDINALS get off the team bus. Smith buttonholes manager EDDIE DYER. \nSMITH Eddie, what's all this talk about your Cardinals refusing to play? \nDYER We're here, aren't we? We didn't come to New York to go to Macy's. Dyer continues past him. Here comes big JOE GARAGIOLA. \nSMITH Hey, Garagiola -- \nGARAGIOLA Get lost. Here comes STAN MUSIAL, a class act if there ever was one. \nSMITH Hey, Stan, what's the story? \nTAN REV 6-25-12 88A. \nMUSIAL This is big league baseball, not English tea. Couple a guys might've popped off; it's hot air. \nCUT TO: \n149 INT. HOTEL ROOM - MCALPIN HOTEL - DAY 149 \nSmith types out his report. As rain lashes the window, the Empire State building looms a few block away. \nSMITH (V.O.) St. Louis didn't win the world championship last year without using their heads. They have the same heads this year and should know that they can't pick the players of another club. \nCUT TO: \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 89. \n150 INT. EBBETS FIELD TRAINING TABLE - DAY 150 \nJack sits here alone, tending to a bat. Cleaning it with rubbing alcohol, handling it like the friend it is. Rickey joins him. He has a newspaper in hand. He holds it up. \nRICKEY National League President Frick says this is America and baseball is America's game. He says one citizen has as much right to play as another. \n(LOOKS UP) Baseball will go on as planned once the rain stops. Jack eyes his bat. \nJACK Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey? \nRICKEY Because my job is to win. I have an obligation to Brooklyn to put the best team on the field I can. Your presence on the roster increases our chances of winning. Not buying it, Jack looks over at him. \nJACK If this is winning, I'd hate to see us on a losing streak. \nCUT TO: \n150A INT. DODGER LOCKER ROOM - EBBETS FIELD - DAY 150A \nGuys change into their street clothes. Branca reads to Reese from the New York Post. Walker listens in from his locker. \nBRANCA Listen to this: Right now Robinson is the loneliest man I have ever seen in sports. \n(UPSET) Who's this guy to say Jackie's lonely? He doesn't wear it on his sleeve. Man's got one helluva game face. Take no prisoners. How does some reporter know how he feels. They stop talking as Robinson walks past, the last one into the shower, a couple of towels around him. \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 89A. \nBRANCA Lonely? I say its the best game face in the world. \nWALKER So long as he showers lonely, he can have whatever face he wants. \nCUT TO: \n151 EXT.

Then, about five rows behind her, two RACIST FANS find their seats. They spot Jack down at first. \nRACIST FAN #1 Look there he is! Black as the ace of spades! \nGOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 90. \nRACIST FAN #1 Damn! You believe that? A genuine nigger in a Dodger uniform. As Rachel winces at his words -- \nBROOKLYN FAN #1 Shut up and go back to St. Louis! \nRACIST FAN #1 Hey, you got a nigger on your team! \nBROOKLYN FAN #2 So what?! He's better than anyone you got! \n", "test3_id": 1733}

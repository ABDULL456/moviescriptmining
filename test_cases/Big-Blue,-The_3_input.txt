JACQUES (with a sigh) It's my apartment. 
UNCLE LOUIS (jumping up) Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast. 
JACQUES Uncle Louis, we have a guest! 
UNCLE LOUIS I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. (them calming down, to Johana) Did you bring the cassettes? 
INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA 
JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze. 
JACQUES (solicitously) You think it'll be all right? You'll be comfortable here? 
JOHANA (catching her breath) It's going to be... interesting. 
EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY 
JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port. 
ROBERTO (glancing at his watch) ... It's not like him to be late. Of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all.  Once in Capri, he... 
JOHANA (interrupting) We get the picture, Roberto. (looks over her shoulder) Jacques, I think Louis needs help. 
JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger. 
UNCLE LOUIS (yelling) Two dollars for this!  This fish wasn't caught.  It died of cancer! 
JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering. 
ROBERTO (pointing) Here he comes! 
A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port. Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO. 
Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long. If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA MARIPOSA. 
ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines. 
ENZO Jacques!  Johana! 
JOHANA Enzo! 
JACQUES Enzo! 
During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all awestruck except for ROBERTO. 
ROBERTO (meaning the speed boat) Where did you get that? 
ENZO (meaning Bonita) "That"!  This is not a "that"... This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous Spanish actress. (whispering to Bonita) ... Who is going to be careful with the varnish... (back to Roberto) And who has come to spend a few days with us. (and very quickly) Where's Mamma? 
ROBERTO (checking watch) You have eight hours before she gets here. 
ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY 
Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs. 
UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody. 
ENZO He's really going totally deaf! 
UNCLE LOUIS I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy!  You take care of your eyes, I'll take care of my ears! 
ENZO (laughing) I'm sorry Uncle Louis. 
UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey. 
UNCLE LOUIS Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might just save us from your bullshit. 
The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen. JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door: it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a bottle. 
JACQUES I'm glad you could come.  I want you to meet Enzo. 
ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands. 
LAWRENCE (with a smile) So you're the famous Enzo Molinari? 
ENZO (with an even bigger smile) In the flesh.  I have that honor! 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the ceiling. 
BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make- up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror. 
BONITA You're going to live here permanently? 
JOHANA ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little. 
JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on her make-up like a professional.

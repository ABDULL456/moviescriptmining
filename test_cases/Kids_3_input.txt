CASPER It's no big deal, right? 
TELLY Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. 
CASPER Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. (they both start laughing) It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. 
TELLY Yep. 
CASPER They're gonna tell their grand kids. (mimicking an old lady) That Telly. He sure was good in the sack! 
The two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited. 
They walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool. 
TELLY You thirsty? 
CASPER Yeah, I feel dehydrated. 
TELLY You got any money? 
CASPER Three pennies and a ball of lint. 
TELLY You down with the boost? 
CASPER (whispers) Unzip my pack, yo. 
He turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack. 
INT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY 
The grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch buffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN MAN. He is watching a small black and white television set. 
The two boys enter. 
Casper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer. 
Telly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash register. 
TELLY Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg? 
KOREAN STORE OWNER Whah? 
TELLY Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it? 
KOREAN STORE OWNER Whah is dissdee? 
Casper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two 40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor. 
TELLY Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. 
KOREAN STORE OWNER I no understand you. Maybe crazy. 
A round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into his backpack. 
TELLY I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg? 
KOREAN STORE OWNER Whah you say? Dissdee? 
Casper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch. 
CASPER He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English? 
The two of them both run out the door. 
Telly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket. 
The two boys run off.

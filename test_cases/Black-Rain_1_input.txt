Charlie puts his foot up on Nick's fender to tie his shoe. Nick, spotting an ankle holster peeking from Charlie's sock, grabs Charlie's foot.  Charlie teeters. 
NICK What's this? 
CHARLIE Let go... 
Nick pulls out a Beretta 32. 
CHARLIE Back-up. 
NICK Get rid of it. 
CHARLIE Why? 
NICK It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat. 
CHARLIE (looking at Nick's bike) I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater. 
The Harley comes to life spitting a cloud of blue smoke. Nick puts on his paint-flecked helmet, slides down some ski goggles. 
CHARLIE Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello. 
NICK Charlie... 
Nick pops the bike into gear. 
NICK ... You still got shaving cream on your ear. 
Nick rolls out and disappears in a haze of blue smoke. 
EXT.  BELT PARKWAY - VERRAZANO BRIDGE - NIGHT 
WE FIND Nick, a lonely, solitary figure bobbing in and out of the lights and shadows.  The SOUND of wind whips through his helmet; cold air stings his cheeks... The tail lights of Nick's bike disappear into the night. 
EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT 
Civil service heaven.  Nick hits the cut switch and glides past the manicured lawns and well kept houses of this development.  A basketball net in every driveway, a Buick or Chrysler in every garage. 
One house sticks out.  The lawn is brown, paint is peeling off the garage door and newspapers are scattered on the driveway.  Nick glides once around the cul de sac looking at the house.  His house.  It's as inviting as an open grave.  He shoots away. 
INT.  EL GRECO DINER - STATEN ISLAND - NIGHT 
A hanger sized roadhouse, wall to wall red velvet. 
Nick's the sole figure at the counter, coffee and the Daily News in front of him.  A NURSE walks in and sits down a half dozen seats away.  Nick look up. 
NICK Short shift? 
CONNIE Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Nick and Connie are in bed.  They're both looking up at the ceiling.  They've just made love. 
CONNIE It's getting too cold even for me, Nick. 
NICK Connie... 
CONNIE All right, how's the new partner? 
NICK High spirits, desire, commitment. 
CONNIE You'll take care of that. 
NICK Give me a break, would you? 
CONNIE If you give me one. 
Nick kisses her.  The first suggestion of real affection. The SOUND of someone KNOCKING on the door.  Reluctantly, they stop.  Connie gets up and puts on her robe. 
NICK Are you expecting anyone? 
CONNIE I wasn't expecting you. 
She disappears down the hallway.  We HEAR the door open, then telling someone to wait. 
CONNIE (poking her head in the room) Imagine a small, greasy Boy Scout. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CONNIE'S APARTMENT 
Nick, wearing only his pants, is doing a slow burn. Charlie is holding his hands up defensively. 
CHARLIE ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's -- 
NICK -- I should tear your head off. 
CHARLIE Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him -- 
NICK -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up. 
Charlie looks away momentarily, letting it slide.  He knows he's on sensitive ground.

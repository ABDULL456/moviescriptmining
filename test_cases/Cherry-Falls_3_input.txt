The door at the top of the stairs opens. 
Leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on. 
The basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his mother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks. 
Leonard sits Jody back up. 
A little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard. 
Leonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. 
LEONARD (singing) 'It's a family affair, It's a family affair.' 
He undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of Jody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's badly beaten up. 
Jody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye. 
LEONARD Well, we may be family One in four chance. 
Leonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody. 
LEONARD Sheriff Brent, you will be the second of the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die. But first you will watch as I slice up your little girl. 
Brent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, nubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf. 
Leonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it. 
Jody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to shake. 
LEONARD You're shaking too much. If you don't stop shaking Jody, I'll have to kill before I carve. We wouldn't want that. 
Jody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. Her father watches, horrified. 
Cut to: 
EXT.  STREET 
Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch his breath for a second. He notices something. 
EXT.  LEONARD'S 
Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch. 
EXT.  STREET 
Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's hers. 
INT.  BASEMENT 
Leonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the 'R'. Jody and her father stare at each other, helplessly. 
LEONARD My mother said, after you and your three droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms. Is that true? Did people really call her a slut and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, she saw only you. 
Jody gags in pain. Brent looks away. 
LEONARD Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or will I cause her much more pain. 
Brent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, barely able to stand it anymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned. 
EXT.  HOUSE 
Kenny rings it again. No one answers. 
He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the curtains. 
INT.  HOUSE 
Kenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch. 
EXT.  HOUSE 
Kenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one answers.  Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM 
Kenny climbs into the living room and looks around. 
KENNY Hello? Jody? 
INT.   BASEMENT 
Leonard hears Kenny. He can't ignore him any longer. 
LEONARD Who the fuck is breaking into my house? 
Leonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the stairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass.

ELLA MAE Well... I hope these will work for your niece. She can always come back in and swap sizes. 
Lazarus points to a small display of fine lotions. 
LAZARUS Mind I ask, what's all this business here? 
ELLA MAE These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. 
LAZARUS For your hands? 
ELLA MAE Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. (unscrewing a jar) This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower. 
LAZARUS (likes what he smells) I'll take a jar of that, too. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Rae rattles into the kitchen, her damp clothes clinging to her form. She picks up Laz's guitar off the table and places it in her lap. 
She plucks a few random strings out of boredom and smiles. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON 
The same apathetic girl is working the front counter as Laz enters the drug store with a basket of arranged vegetables. 
LAZARUS Lookin' for Miss Angela. 
GIRL She in the back. 
Laz makes his way to the back of the store. He spies Angela in the back pharmacy, sorting pills for a pick-up. He watches her work for a moment until, finally, she sees him. 
ANGELA Wait right there. 
Laz waits as Angela rounds the corner. 
LAZARUS I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans. 
ANGELA (taking the basket) You didn't have to do this. 
LAZARUS Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank. 
ANGELA Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it. 
Angela smiles. There is tension and attraction between the two. 
LAZARUS Look here. I got somethin' special for you. 
Angela is flush as Laz moves closer than he has ever been before. He reaches in the basket for the jar of cream. 
LAZARUS This here is a whipped... body cream. And it's got a smell to it. Tell me what you think. 
Laz holds the jar up to her nose. Angela closes her eyes and smells. Her expression says enough -- she loves it. 
LAZARUS They call this Ginger Souffle. Best if it... if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub... or shower. 
Angela takes the lotion from his hand. She is subtle and demure, but the woman is deeply affected. She smiles. 
ANGELA This was very sweet of you. 
LAZARUS Well. Hope you enjoy it. 
Angela watches Laz as he walks out the door. The apathetic girl moves up behind Angela. 
GIRL Oooooo. 
ANGELA Hush up. 
EXT. FISHERVILLE SQUARE - MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON 
Laz opens his truck and waves goodbye to Old Red. Melvin is holding a healthy squash. 
RED You gonna be on the square later on? 
LAZARUS Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm headin' home. 
RED Stay cool. It's a hot one. 
Laz pulls away in his truck and rounds the corner just as R.L. crosses the street. He steps over to talk to Red. 
R.L. Hey, Red. Was that Laz just left? 
RED Yes'sir, Rev'rend.

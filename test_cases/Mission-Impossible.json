SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nPHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. \nPHELPS Opening the doors.  Go under. \nHe jabs ENTER on his keyboard. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT \nETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator drops to just over their heads and stops. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nGOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nWaiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a microphone. \nETHAN He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. \nJACK (O.S.) Give me a break, Pops. \nSARAH Such a nice ass. \nJACK (O.S.) And a lonely ass. \nETHAN Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes. \nCLAIRE (O.S.) Roger that. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nBack inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft. \nEXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nJACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes and SPARKS. \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous couple. \nETHAN In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll. \nJACK (O.S.) Roger that.  Opening doors now. \nETHAN Stairway, you\u00edre wrapped, go to transport. \nETHAN\u00edS voice comes over HANNAH\u00edS earpiece. \nHANNAH En route. \nHANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs. \nINT.

ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nJACK\u00edS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the approaching ceiling. \nJACK Uh -- then I have a problem. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nGOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer, slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nJACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching roof, covered with spikes. \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nThrough the monitor, ETHAN sees JACK\u00edS P.O.V. of the roof of the building approaching.  Fast. \nETHAN Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do you hear me. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nOn top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop. \nHe swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster. He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him. \nETHAN (O.S.) Come on, Jack, come on. \nJACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his hands, he SCREAMS -- \n--and he\u00eds crushed to death against the roof. \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was JACK\u00edS signal. \nETHAN Jack.  Jack. \nHe closes his eyes, knowing what that means. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nPHELPS also sees the static. \nPHELPS Man down.  Stay where you are.  I\u00edm on my way. \nHe gets up and races out of the apartment. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nGOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the elevator button but it won\u00edt even light up.  He studies the elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and SARAH did moments before. \nHe hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small door at the shaft\u00eds base. \nEXT.

The coat hits the floor like a dead body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. \nCLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S shivering. \nETHAN (CONT'D) Where were you? \nCLAIRE I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away. \nETHAN That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here? \nCLAIRE (slowly) Who is \"they?\" \nETHAN Did they send you...Did they send you? \nCLAIRE Who is they, who is they? \nETHAN grabs her by the wrists. \nETHAN Who sent you?!  Who sent you? \nCLAIRE (screaming) No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! \nShe sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN releases his grip on her wrists. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT \nETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. \nCLAIRE Why haven't they brought us in yet? \nETHAN I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. \nA long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. \nCLAIRE What are you going to do? \nETHAN I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. \nCLAIRE Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... \nETHAN Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. \nThe computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. \nTHE COMPUTER SCREEN \nBlinking -- \"MESSAGE WAITING.\"  ETHAN hurries over and clicks on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows up: \n?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. \n?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL \n?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS \n?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH \nCLAIRE looks to ETHAN. \nCLAIRE The message is for Job. \nETHAN I'm going to answer it. \nEXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY \nETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to ETHAN. \nETHAN Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? \nWithout turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. \nMATTHIAS Would you remove your hat please? \n", "test2_true": "MATTHIAS You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission. \nReluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. \nSomewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. \nETHAN I thought I was going to see Max. \nMATTHIAS You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. \nETHAN Then what am I doing here? \nMATTHIAS Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say. \nETHAN I don't communicate very well through a shroud. \nMATTHIAS If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely. \nETHAN I'm willing to take the chance. \nMATTHIAS Very well. \nMAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of severity. \nMAX Who are you and what are you doing here? \nETHAN I need one hundred thousand dollars. \nMAX Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? \nETHAN Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand. \nMAX The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox. \nETHAN That depends. \nMAX On what? \nETHAN Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. \nMAX It's quite out of the question. \nETHAN The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt. \nMAX And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man? \nETHAN Like Job? \nMAX Ah, but, we're asking about you. \nETHAN I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. \nMAX Why, may I ask? \nETHAN That's the question I want to ask Job. \nMAX I don't know Job any more than he knows me. \nETHAN Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction. \nMAX Why should I? \nETHAN Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location. \nMAX It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. \nETHAN Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits. \nMAX (Pause.) Mm - Hmmm... \nETHAN Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car? \n", "test2_id": 667, "test3_input": "KITTRIDGE and BARNES have seen CLAIRE go through MAX\u00edS Business Car and past the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door.

Remember him? \nHere PHELPS pulls out his assembled pistol. \nCLAIRE You knew about Jim? \nPHELPS Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan? \nETHAN Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago. \nPHELPS They stamped it, didn\u00edt they?

Well, Claire, you\u00edve asked the question and you are the answer. \nETHAN I knew about Jim. \nPHELPS But, he didn\u00edt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  \"Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour\u00eds wife\", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the world\u00eds lovers, he\u00eds tortured by the same, one pathetic question - \"does she feel the same way I do?\" \nJIM turns to CLAIRE. \nPHELPS Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them? \nCLAIRE Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here. \nCLAIRE goes to ETHAN. \nCLAIRE (CONT'D) The money Ethan. \nETHAN hands her the money. \nETHAN You\u00edve earned it. \nCLAIRE goes to Jim with the money. \nPHELPS Count it. \nCLAIRE starts to count. \nETHAN Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? \nPHELPS Keep counting Claire. \nCLAIRE It was me.

It can kill you. \nPHELPS shoots CLAIRE.  Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN. The gun is lost.  PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground.  His watch alarm beeps rapidly.

PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door and climbs through it -- \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY \n-- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out. \nHe pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the smooth surface of the train. \nNow for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes. \nHe drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the ENGINEER. \nHalf kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his belt. \nHe looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches. \nPHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nKRIEGER is at the controls.

{"train": "\"Mission: Impossible\", shooting draft, revised by Robert Towne \nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT \n16TH AUGUST 1995 \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"SCENE OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nINT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWe're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen. \nThe television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while \nON THE SCREEN \nA bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T- shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the room behind him.  A legend: \nKIEV \nKASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian which is subtitled. \nANATOLY Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us. \nKASIMOV (sobbing) I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun. \nANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid. \nKASIMOV I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I didn't lay a finger on her. \nANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN. \nANATOLY Kasimov.  Don't flounder. \nIN THE CLOSET \nJACK, impatient, checks his watch. \nJACK Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come on, come on! \nON THE SCREEN \nKASIMOV You're the only one who can help me. \nDesperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits his hand away and smacks him around the head. \nIN THE CLOSET \nJACK reacts. \nON THE SCREEN \nANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. \nANATOLY C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. \nKASIMOV They'll kill me. \nANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. \nANATOLY You asked for my help.  You asked for my help...come on... \nKASIMOV You're right, of course. \nIN THE CLOSET \nJACK leans forward. \nJACK The name pal...give us the name. \nON THE SCREEN \nKASIMOV The contact in Minsk..the contact in Minsk..works in a travel agency. \nIN THE CLOSET \nJACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, questioningly. \nJACK Claire. \nETHAN Jack. \nShe almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at large. \nETHAN IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! \nJACK Just waiting for you, tubs. \nHe walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring. \nWe move in on it -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. JET - DAY \n-- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. \nThe pilot's voice makes an announcement. \nVOICE (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule. \nA FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing out menus. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? \nA passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps? \nThe MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. \nPHELPS No, I prefer the theatre. \nA look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes stilted. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine? \nPHELPS Perhaps you'd choose one for me. \nThe ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the armrest. \nAT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN. \nThe FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. \nBACK AT PHELPS' SEAT \nThe ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. He takes it without a word and she moves on. \nPHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in. \nHe presses play. \nON THE TAPE, \nthe image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. \nKITTRIDGE (on the tape) Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- \nThe screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks down a foreign street. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) -- a former KGB Line X officer now working the international black market selling intelligence.  This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe. \nThe screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) For security reasons, the NOC list is divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas.  This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. \nThe Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava River. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list.  I don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim.  We're keeping it internally black. Because of its urgency, I've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group. \nStill photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. \nETHAN Why not? \nPHELPS Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out. \nCLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange: \nETHAN How was Chicago? \nPHELPS Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says \"All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?\"  She says no. \"Oh, it was my friend Sammy.\"  She says it wasn't Sammy.  \"Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou.\"  \"No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!\" \nPHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is in his line of sight. \nPHELPS (CONT'D) Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a look. \nHe leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. \nEXT. PRAGUE - DAY \nETHAN's POV of Embassy. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY \nETHAN nods. \nPHELPS (CONT'D) Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them.  If they're exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over here.  Take a lock at this. \nCLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is playing. \nETHAN is distracted by it. \nINSERT - TELEVISION \nSENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, is holding forth: \nSENATOR WALTZER I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's \"black budget.\"  These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one -- who are these people?!  We were living in a democracy the last time I checked. \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN looks back at JIM. \nETHAN You're going to use Walter? \nPHELPS He's our guy. \nETHAN Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? \nPHELPS Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. \nETHAN He won't be back in a hurry? \nPHELPS No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work? \nETHAN Sure.  If the main character does. \nPHELPS If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust to make him believable? \nJACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum. \nJACK Sorry, am I interrupting? \nETHAN Always. \nJACK shows the gum to ETHAN. \nJACK Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock you can't pick -- \nHalf the gum is red, the other half is green. \nJACK (CONT'D) Red light.  Green light.  Mash them together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on you -- you have five seconds. \nHe offers the gum to ETHAN. \nPHELPS Are you gonna take it? \nCLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. \nETHAN (relenting) Give me the God damn gum. \nETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a place to hide. \nETHAN OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors. \nSARAH What about my coat?  I'll freeze. \nJACK (O.S.) I don't have it. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nPHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. \nPHELPS Opening the doors.  Go under. \nHe jabs ENTER on his keyboard. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT \nETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator drops to just over their heads and stops. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nGOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nWaiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a microphone. \nETHAN He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. \nJACK (O.S.) Give me a break, Pops. \nSARAH Such a nice ass. \nJACK (O.S.) And a lonely ass. \nETHAN Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes. \nCLAIRE (O.S.) Roger that. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nBack inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft. \nEXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nJACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes and SPARKS. \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous couple. \nETHAN In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll. \nJACK (O.S.) Roger that.  Opening doors now. \nETHAN Stairway, you\u00edre wrapped, go to transport. \nETHAN\u00edS voice comes over HANNAH\u00edS earpiece. \nHANNAH En route. \nHANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nThe button marked \"ROOF\" lights up, seemingly all by itself. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT \nThe car engages with a sharp jolt -- \nJACK Hey. \nEXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT \nPHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his shoulder.  Paranoia\u00eds setting in. \nEXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT \nOutside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in the midst of a lover\u00eds quarrel, in Russian. \nPan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening gloom. \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nETHAN and SARAH hear PHELP\u00edS voice over the monitor. \nSARAH The package is in the open. \nETHAN Jim.  Jim.  He\u00eds in the open. \nPHELPS (O.S.) I\u00edve got a shadow. \nETHAN Can you lose him? \nPHELPS (O.S.) No.  Abort. \nOver ETHAN\u00eds shoulder, SARAH sees GOLITSYN getting away.  Fog starts to roll over the river towards the bridge. \nSARAH Ethan.  He\u00eds out of pocket. \nETHAN (to Phelps) Jim we can\u00edt. \nPHELPS (O.S.) Abort.  That\u00eds an order. \nETHAN Negative, Golitsyn\u00eds on the move. \nINT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT \nSeated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN argue. \nPHELPS (O.S.) No, damn it, no, I said ABORT! \nEXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT \nOutside the Embassy, SARAH and ETHAN argue. \nETHAN Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, I\u00edm coming to you. \nSARAH Jim gave an abort, we should walk away. \nETHAN No, we\u00edre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move! \nETHAN takes off for the bridge, leaving SARAH to shadow GOLITSYN. \nEXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT \nHANNAH hurries toward the getaway vehicle. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT \nETHAN moves to the bridge stairs. \nPHELPS (O.S.) Where are you? \nETHAN About two hundred yards from the bridge. \nPHELPS (O.S.) They\u00edre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications. \nETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor and again sees PHELPS\u00ed POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted. \nEXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT \nSARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears into the fog at the edge of the river. \nEXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT \nETHAN checks his monitor again. \nTHE MONITOR \nHe screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone\u00eds tongue down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart. \nAfter a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side. \nFLAT VOICE (O.S.) Satcom seven. \nETHAN Central Europe.  Unsecured. \nFLAT VOICE (O.S.) Designator? \nETHAN Bravo Echo one one. \nFLAT VOICE (O.S.) Switching. \nThere is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the line. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) This is Kittridge. \nETHAN Go secure. \nPause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Go ahead. \nETHAN They\u00edre dead. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Who\u00eds dead? \nETHAN My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- don\u00edt know \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Are you damaged? \nETHAN They knew we were coming.  Golitsyn\u00eds dead too.  The disk is gone. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Are you intact? \nETHAN Do you read me?  The list is in the open! \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed? \nETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGE\u00edS voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now. \nETHAN I don\u00edt think so. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Don\u00edt think, be sure.  Are you clean? \nETHAN Yes. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Location green.  One hour.  I\u00edll be there myself. \nETHAN You\u00edre in Prague? \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Don\u00edt disappoint me. \nETHAN No sir. \nKITTRIDGE (O.S.) One hour. \nHe hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd. \nEXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT \nETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings. \nETHAN\u00edS POV \nStraight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace. \nBrilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nETHAN'S POV \nDiners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- \n-- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes widen.  KA BOOM! \nThe tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. \nAt the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. \nEXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT \nETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square. \nEXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT \nSilence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, then puts his jacket back on. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the next bulb. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT \nAt the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports. \nAs he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nHe comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by one, he switches them off. \nTHE LAPTOP \nJACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN wakes it up. \nThe computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: \nSELECT USENET GROUP \nETHAN TYPES IN \njob 314 \nETHAN Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 March. \nThe computer replies: \nSEARCHING STRING NOT FOUND \nETHAN tries again: \nmax.com \nThe answer: \nSEARCH STRING NOT FOUND \nHe tries a few more, quickly -- \"job,\" \"jobs,\" \"joblist.com,\" but nothing comes up.  He tries something else -- \"scroll usenet groups.\" \nThe computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. \nETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of \"job 314\" he should add to the others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. \nETHAN Take off your God damn coat! \nHe grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. \nCLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S shivering. \nETHAN (CONT'D) Where were you? \nCLAIRE I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away. \nETHAN That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here? \nCLAIRE (slowly) Who is \"they?\" \nETHAN Did they send you...Did they send you? \nCLAIRE Who is they, who is they? \nETHAN grabs her by the wrists. \nETHAN Who sent you?!  Who sent you? \nCLAIRE (screaming) No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! \nShe sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN releases his grip on her wrists. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT \nETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. \nCLAIRE Why haven't they brought us in yet? \nETHAN I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. \nA long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. \nCLAIRE What are you going to do? \nETHAN I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. \nCLAIRE Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... \nETHAN Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. \nThe computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. \nTHE COMPUTER SCREEN \nBlinking -- \"MESSAGE WAITING.\"  ETHAN hurries over and clicks on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows up: \n?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. \n?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL \n?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS \n?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH \nCLAIRE looks to ETHAN. \nCLAIRE The message is for Job. \nETHAN I'm going to answer it. \nEXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY \nETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to ETHAN. \nETHAN Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? \nWithout turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. \nMATTHIAS Would you remove your hat please? \nMAX Very good. \nETHAN Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first. \nANGLE \nMATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching the digital read-out on the RF scanner. \nMATTHIAS Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good. \nMAX That's not so good for you, my friend. \nOn the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. \nMATTHIAS Thirty-two and change. \nMAX (to Ethan) Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up. \nShe looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to make up her mind about something. \nMATTHIAS Forty-four.  Forty-five. \nETHAN I'd say you've got about two minutes. \nMAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- \n--nothing happens. He opens the French doors that lead out onto a balcony. \nEXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY \nThe OTHER MAN comes out on the balcony.  Nothing out here but a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at the street. \nDown below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBack inside: \nMATTHIAS Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. \nEXT. MAX'S APARTMENT \nA pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street activity. KITTRIDGE and the FEMALE CZECH AGENT exit the taxi as BARNES and TWO OTHER UNDERCOVER MALE IMF agents leave the van. \nINT. MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY \nLed by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit the stairs. They climb them silently. \nINT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY \nA CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she turns off the vacuum cleaner. \nFEMALE IMF (in czech) Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. \nKITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment and -- \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \n-- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between them and takes command of the place -- \n--but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom, and just as quickly out again. \nEXT. POWDER TOWER - TOP SHOT - DAY \nMAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower. \nEXT. MAX'S APARTMENT BALCONY - DAY \nKITTRIDGE kicks open the door to the balcony, comes outside, and looks around.  Nobody in sight. \nKITTRIDGE GOD D- \nINT. MAX'S CAR - ETHAN AND MAX - DAY \nMAX Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again. (turns to Ethan) Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You're a good sport.  Do accept the compliment. \nETHAN Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine? \nHe types in a single word. \nDISAVOWED \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TRAIN - STATEROOM - NIGHT \nThe word \"disavowed\" dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a high speed train, where the newly assembled IM force has gathered around a table -- KRIEGER, a dangerous-looking Frenchman of forty or so, LUTHER STICKELL, a muscular, soft- spoken American in his mid-thirties.  ETHAN, and CLAIRE. LUTHER regards the others warily. \nETHAN Simple game.  Four players. (points to Krieger) Exfil opens the pocket -- (and to Luther) -- cyber ops lifts the wallet. \nKRIEGER Bank? \nETHAN IMF mainframe. \nKRIEGER (after a moment) Where exactly is it? \nETHAN In Langley. \nLUTHER In Langley?  The one in Virginia, Langley? \nKRIEGER Inside CIA headquarters at Langley. \nETHAN nods.  KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE. \nKRIEGER (CONT'D) Is he serious? \nCLAIRE Always. \nKRIEGER If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA. \nLUTHER What are we downloading? \nETHAN Information. \nLUTHER What kind? \nETHAN Profitable. \nCLAIRE Payment on delivery. \nLUTHER I don't know.  This I don't know. \nETHAN This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom. \nLUTHER There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. (correcting himself) With that exceptional piece of work. \nETHAN You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks. \nLUTHER You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's -- \nCLAIRE Krieger can get it. (to Krieger) Right? \nKRIEGER May take a little time. \nETHAN May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you. \nLUTHER Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip -- \nETHAN looks at KRIEGER. \nKRIEGER Twenty-four hours. \nETHAN looks back at LUTHER.  LUTHER thinks. \nLUTHER And I get to keep the equipment when we're done. \nETHAN Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses. \nLUTHER I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal. \nETHAN Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down. \nINT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY \nWhile ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: \nLUTHER'S eyes widen as he gets his first look, on the Visco monitor, of the specific information they're downloading. The NOC list. \nLUTHER Holy mother of God. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nKRIEGER shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  His eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. \nIt's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive. \nKRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches.  He's about to sneeze. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nLUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command into the microphone. \nLUTHER You've done it.  Eject it. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nThe 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets it and signals to be raised. \nSlowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. \nETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal. \nHis eyes widen as he realizes something -- \n--the drop of sweat falls -- \n--and he catches it with his right hand. \nINT. CIA - MEN'S - DAY \nCIA ANALYST crosses corridor from restricted access door to bathroom. \nA toilet FLUSHES, smashing the silence, and the TECHNICIAN staggers out of the bathroom. He goes to the sink and throws some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. \nHe walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nOn one of LUTHER'S laptops, the blinking cursor starts to move down a corridor.  LUTHER speaks into his microphone. \nLUTHER He's rolling.  Get moving! \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN is near the ceiling, but KRIEGER isn't pulling any more.  ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull him up.  KRIEGER shakes his head no. \nETHAN gestures -- \"WHAT?!\" \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nThe cursor is halfway across the screen. \nLUTHER Get out of there -- get out of there -- \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN still dangles.  Holding the rope with one hand, KRIEGER holds out his other, demanding something.  He wants the disk. \nINT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY \nThe TECHNICIAN makes his way back down the corridor, toward the computer room. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nThe blinking cursor is near the edge of the screen and LUTHER is sweating. \nLUTHER He's at the vault - get moving!  1 yellow, 2 yellows...Toast! \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN, still hanging upside down, has refused.  KRIEGER demands again. \nINT. CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY \nEXT. VIRGINIA ROAD - DAY \nIt may be a HUMAN SCREAM or it may be a SIREN'S WAIL but it echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck ROARS away from the headquarters building, making its escape. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - MOVING - DAY \nLUTHER, KRIEGER, CLAIRE and ETHAN, the victorious team, are in the truck's cab.  They exchange looks of massive relief. But no one speaks.  LUTHER, in particular, looks heavily troubled by what they've just done. \nETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to him.  She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. \nKRIEGER, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively. \nETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY \nThe TECHNICIAN who discovered the theft of the list sits at one end of the now-empty conference table in the communications room.  KITTRIDGE sits in a chair beside, staring gravely at him. \nHe gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. \nKITTRIDGE (CONT'D) (to Barnes) You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. \nBARNES What about him...? \nHe gestures to the TECHNICIAN, who watches them anxiously. \nKITTRIDGE I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day.  Just mail him his clothes. \nHe leaves.  Barnes turns to the TECHNICIAN, who looks up at him anxiously. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LONDON - NIGHT \nNight. This street is a row of nondescript hotels, one after the other, with anonymous names like \"Hotel Pomeroy,\" \"Hotel Vincent,\" and \"Hotel Berridge.\" \nLONDON \nINT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThis barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in.  ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max.  He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. \nLUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching CNN. \nCLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. \nKRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. \nKRIEGER You contacting your buyer? (no answer) Ethan? \nFrom the desk, ETHAN glances up.  Then goes back to the computer.  KRIEGER continues to glare over the sofa back. \nKRIEGER (CONT'D) Ethan?  Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? \nETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code.  He  begins to type. \nMAX -- Now might be an excellent time to interpret Scripture face to face. Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.  Take seat 27.  Bring our mutual friend Job. \nKRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor. \nKRIEGER You're not going to any meeting without me. \nETHAN My contact is extremely shy. \nHe goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the \"ENTER\" button. \nLUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. \nKRIEGER I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this. \nCLAIRE Krieger. \nKRIEGER Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue \nETHAN Don't you mean this? \nANCHOR The unlikely setting...a farm in the heartland of America...the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring.  For a report we go live now to CNN correspondent (Joe Jones) in the state capitol, Madison. (Joe)...? \nCNN reporter speaks to camera, on the steps of a courthouse. \nREPORTER Authorities have identified the couple as Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt. \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN looks.  CLAIRE behind him. \nINSERT - SCREEN \nAn OLDER COUPLE, mid-sixties, exit the doors and are led down the steps of the courthouse in shackles.  The Reporter and other news crews race up to the door. \nREPORTER Here they are now. \nCamera follows the couple downstairs.  Police roughly pull them away from the news crews. \nBACK TO SCENE \nINSERT - SCREEN \nREPORTER They were apprehended this morning by the DEA in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug methcathinone, known on the street as \"cat\". \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN \nINSERT - SCREEN \nVOICE (O.S.) Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world.  Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network. \nA public official exits the building.  The reporter and other news crews charge up to him. \nREPORTER Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment please. \nThe image on the television changes to an interview with a PUBLIC OFFICIAL who faces a bank of microphones. \nPUBLIC OFFICIAL I think it's sad, really.  Farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin margin.  I'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means. \nREPORTER That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in charge of this investigation.  Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts. This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, Wisconsin. \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN Kittridge... \nCLAIRE Bastard! \nETHAN switches TV off and paces away from it.  His anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall.  CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her away. \nETHAN Don't...don't touch me... \nCAMERA SWING PANS between them. \nCLAIRE What are you going to do? \nETHAN (turns to her and gestures at TV) He's expecting my call. (strides to door) I'm going to the station... (o/s at door) And I'm going to call him. \nEXT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - RAIN - NIGHT \nETHAN comes out from a side street by Liverpool Street Underground Station and crosses the road to the main station. CLAIRE watches him from the window. \nINT. LONDON TERMINUS RAILWAY STATION - NIGHT \nETHAN hurries down escalator.  CAMERA MOVES IN on him.  He crosses to the TELEPHONE BOXES. He starts to dial a number. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT \nA light flashes and a phone BUZZES.  KITTRIDGE in shirt and tie, picks up.  BARNES and several other AGENTS are monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities related to the Hunt case. \nKITTRIDGE (picking up) Kittridge. \nETHAN (O.S.) I see you've been out visiting the folks. \nKITTRIDGE (covers receiver) It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint? (to Ethan) Been watching a little T.V., have you? \nPHELPS Hey, I showed 'em to you! \nETHAN I remember.. \nPHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an upright position.  He opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers. \nETHAN Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight. \nPHELPS I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge. (a fist into the table) Kittridge! \nPHELPS grips the sides of the table. \nETHAN Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole? \nPHELPS Yeah. \nETHAN How did Kittridge do it?.. \nEXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT \nA reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually happened. \nETHAN VO - first he took care of Jack in the elevator - \nAt the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the building, watching it go and crush Kiefer. \nETHAN VO - he shot you on the bridge - \nOn the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them into the Vltava River. \nETHAN VO - he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.. \nThere on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence.. \nETHAN VO How did he do Hannah? \nHere it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion brilliant behind her... \nETHAN VO No.  No.  He could've taken out Hannah himself. \nPHELPS presses the remote detonator and the car blows.. \nOVER SHOULDER - PHELPS (INT. RAILWAY CAFE) \nETHAN looking intently at him. \nETHAN Why, Jim?  Why? \nAwkward moment. \nPHELPS ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How dare he?  You realize it\u00eds over, you\u00edre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you\u00edve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, we\u00edll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time! \nETHAN We don\u00edt have to, Jim.  He\u00edll come after us. \nPHELPS What\u00eds going to make him do that? \nETHAN What he didn\u00edt get in Prague.  The NOC list. \nPHELPS Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you. \nETHAN A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris. \nPHELPS Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus. \nETHAN If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I\u00edll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris. \nPHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken. \nETHAN Jim...? \nPHELPS I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I\u00edm dead and gone.  God knows what she\u00eds had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.. \nPHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it: \nPHELPS - no.  She can\u00edt know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  There\u00eds too much at stake, Ethan. \nETHAN You\u00edre probably right. \nA MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on the bunk-bed.  We only see his hands as he proceeds to take the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous electrical parts inside. \nINT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY \nMAX is reading the Financial Times.  MATTHIAS is looking out of the window.  A cellular phone rings inside MAX\u00eds briefcase in front of MATTHIAS.  MATTHIAS takes the phone out. \nMATTHIAS Yes... (holds phone out for Max) It\u00eds him. \nMAX (into phone) This wasn\u00edt what we discussed. \nETHAN (O.S.) (on phone) My apologies Max.  Couldn\u00edt be helped. There\u00eds a piece of black cloth under your seat.  Tear it away and you\u00edll find the disk. \nMAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to see. \nOne half of the screen, with the heading \"CRYPTONYM AND OPERATIONAL SPECS\" is already jammed with information.  The blank second half of the screen acquires the title \"TRUE NAME,\" and information starts filling itself in rapidly -- names, addresses, identities. \nAs the two sides match up, a legend flashes: \nIDENTITY MATCH \nMAX (back into phone) Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesn\u00edt prelude a meeting in private. \nETHAN (O.S.) It doesn\u00edt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is. \nMAX The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314. \nETHAN (O.S.) What about Job? \nMAX I wouldn\u00edt worry about him.  Once you\u00edve got the money -- he\u00edll find you. \nINT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) \nLUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red light flashing. \nINT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY \nKITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They turn around and start working their way back again. \nAt the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN passes through the door behind her. \nThe LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES, who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their vision is momentarily blocked -- \n-- and CLAIRE gets up to follow. \nShe follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in doorway. \nBARNES Only four more cars. \nKITTRIDGE And if we don\u00edt find him - we\u00edll search the whole train again. \nBARNES What\u00eds Hunt doing on the TGV? \nKITTRIDGE High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max. \nBARNES But why tell us? \nKITTRIDGE He\u00eds putting on a show, Barnes. \nBARNES What kind of show. \nKITTRIDGE I don\u00edt know. (looks at his wrist monitor) It didn\u00edt say on the tickets. \nKITTRIDGE and BARNES go off back through the next coach. CLAIRE follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into her wristwatch to ETHAN: \nCLAIRE Ethan...Kittridge is on the train. \nETHAN Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther? \nCLAIRE Two cars.  Where are you? \nETHAN You are my eyes.  Stay with him. \nShe moves onto the next coach, going after KITTRIDGE and BARNES. \nINT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - (MAX) - DAY \nOn her computer screen in the business car, an ominous message flashes. \nKITTRIDGE and BARNES have seen CLAIRE go through MAX\u00edS Business Car and past the OTHER MAN at the bathroom door. They follow, but suspect the locked bathroom door and stop there to listen. \nINT. LAST EXECUTIVE CAR - MOVING - DAY \nCLAIRE moves swiftly through the last car (after MAX\u00edS car). up into the Club Car and opens the door leading to the BAGGAGE CAR.  Goes in.  The door slams shut. \nKITTRIDGE Hello, Luther.  Where\u00eds Hunt? \nLUTHER Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being modemed off the train. \nKITTRIDGE Where? \nINT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY \nCLAIRE enters a little breathless.  Spotting PHELP\u00edS profile in the darkened car. \nCLAIRE Ethan\u00eds right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him. \nETHAN Of course - I\u00edm sorry to hear you say that Claire. \nCLAIRE Ethan? \nPHELPS Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him? \nHere PHELPS pulls out his assembled pistol. \nCLAIRE You knew about Jim? \nPHELPS Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan? \nETHAN Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago. \nPHELPS They stamped it, didn\u00edt they?  Those damn Gideons. \nPHELP\u00edS watch alarm goes off. \nPHELPS Two minutes til Krieger shows.  This\u00edll have to be quicker than I\u00edd like. Certainly quicker than you\u00edd like. \nCLAIRE Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.. \nPHELPS Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, you\u00edve asked the question and you are the answer. \nETHAN I knew about Jim. \nPHELPS But, he didn\u00edt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  \"Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour\u00eds wife\", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the world\u00eds lovers, he\u00eds tortured by the same, one pathetic question - \"does she feel the same way I do?\" \nJIM turns to CLAIRE. \nPHELPS Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them? \nCLAIRE Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here. \nCLAIRE goes to ETHAN. \nCLAIRE (CONT'D) The money Ethan. \nETHAN hands her the money. \nETHAN You\u00edve earned it. \nCLAIRE goes to Jim with the money. \nPHELPS Count it. \nCLAIRE starts to count. \nETHAN Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town? \nPHELPS Keep counting Claire. \nCLAIRE It was me.  I did it. \nCLAIRE hands PHELPS the money. \nPHELPS Satisfied? \nCLAIRE All ten million. \nA cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. \nETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof. \nHe is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nKRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over PHELPS and then back to him. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY \nPHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the roof. \nETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto the roof. \nPHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance. \nThey're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY \nKRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY \nPHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on. \n-- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- \n-- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! \nINT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY \nAs the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes one last time.  This time it says: \nCONNECTION TERMINATED. TRANSFER LOST. \nMAX'S face falls. \nMAX Damn! \nINT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY \nAnother CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. \nCONDUCTOR No, no, it's IN the tunnel! \nVOICE (O.S.) Stop the train! \nCONDUCTOR It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, accelerate. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY \nFor a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone. \nThey're dangling from either side of it. \nPHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other cup. \nThe helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER pushing it up to full speed again. \nBut it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY \nPHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of KRIEGER'S copter. \nHe doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction. \nAnother train. \nAt the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by. \nThe helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid. \nKRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly. \n", "test1_input": "JACK Great.  Come on. \nINT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT \nAs the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nJIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy one, as someone hurrying up stairs. \nPHELPS Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. \nINT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT \nOn a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. \nHANNAH En route. \nShe also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the lenses. \nPHELPS (O/S) Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to night vision). \nHANNAH\u00edS VISCO POV \nthe party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green where SARAH sprayed it. \nINT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT \nThe SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down the stairs and pass a sign that says \"Denied Area -- Political Attaches Only.\"  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. \nHe nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it says \"Out of Order.\"  They head for it anyway. \nA MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them by surprise. \nJACK Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. \nGUARD Excuse me, can I help you? \nSARAH -- which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility. \nSARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. \nSARAH (CONT'D) As you can see. this area has both a Marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times. \nShe walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes a message -- \"ACCESS DENIED.\"  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. \nSARAH (CONT'D) (covering) Senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named JACK? \nShe tries the thumb again, Still no soap. \nETHAN Jack?  I believe we did have a young man named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I recall.  Constantly late or behind in his work. \nNow the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them. \nGUARD Excuse me, let me see that ID again! \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT \nJACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening to their conversation. \nPHELPS (O.S.) Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing. \nETHAN (O.S.) (with the Senator's southern accent) We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times. \nFinally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. \nJACK Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on it. \nHe quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download. \nTHE LAPTOP \nthere's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. \nINT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT \nIgnoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time the message flashes -- \n", "test1_true": "-- and the elevator doors slide open briskly. \nThe GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. \nGUARD Oh. Sorry, sir. \nHe snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and the doors close behind them. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT \nJACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he can see them inside. \nJACK The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely off. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nPHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's view of the party on his video monitors. \nPHELPS (a touch of impatience) Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. \nINT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT \nHANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's glowing head. \nHANNAH He's heading to the denied area. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nThis work room is filled with combination lock filing cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them upside down on top of a filing cabinet. \nETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, switching several times. \nETHAN (to Sarah) Higher.  Higher. \nSARAH Higher. \nETHAN Right, right.  Good. \nSARAH adjusts the glasses. \nTHROUGH THE GLASSES, \nthe view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nOn PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS barks out a warning. \nPHELPS Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already moving up. \nETHAN Jack we're in position. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT \nIn a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are waiting for it to arrive. \nETHAN Jack.  Jack. \nJACK I didn't touch it. \nThe elevator stops, the doors open -- \n-- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \nPHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with GOLITSYN inside. \nPHELPS (tension rising) He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! \nINT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_input": "And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly resists.  He senses it and pulls away. \nETHAN Sorry. \nHe rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to the bed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CIA LANGLEY - DAY \nSeen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked out of a thick forest. \nLANGLEY \nINT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY \nKITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various computer and television screens around the room.  KITTRIDGE leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. \nBARNES What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code. \nAGENT LOWDEN/AGENT MAREK He may have used Phelps' code. They were friends, and Phelps, was still valid for twenty-four hours. \nBARNES If that's the case, we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agent's code immediately... \nKITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a BANG. \nKITTRIDGE I can't believe what I'm listening to. Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys are standing here trying to figure out what kind of shoes he had on!  I don't care how he did it, I want to know why he did it!  Is he recruiting?  For what purpose? \nFrom somewhere in the building, an ALARM sounds, not too loud in here. \nAGENT PAT/AGENT LOWDEN Survival. \nThe alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the building. \nKITTRIDGE Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive, he initiates.  The question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that noise?! \nAn AGENT is just coming in from the hallway. \nAGENT Fire alarm, Gene. \nKITTRIDGE Oh, for -- do we have to evacuate? \nBARNES That's S.O.P.. \nKITTRIDGE S.O.P.. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VIRGINIA TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY \nSIRENS BLARING, three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway. \nINT. CIA LANGLEY LOBBY - DAY \nThree FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA headquarters building.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment. \nETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk.  He looks up, above him. \nEtched into the top of one wall are the words \"AND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE.\" \nThey reach the GUARD.  ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows to the front of the group and takes charge. \nETHAN (to the Guard) We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven, and twelve. \nThe GUARD checks a screen in front of him. \nGUARD RICHARD Yeah.  That's what I've got too. \nThe FIREMEN look at each other.  Who is this guy?  But he seems to know what he's talking about, so -- \nETHAN (to the Guard) What sector's the air conditioning? \nGUARD RANDALL Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one. \nETHAN I gotta go in there and shut it down! \nGUARD RANDALL Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off. \n", "test2_true": "GUARD RICHARD (reciting policy) Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did not go off -- \nEXT. CIA LANGLEY - PARKING AREA - DAY \nOne fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the parking area of the headquarters building.  Second truck roars past.  LUTHER watches it go. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nLUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company manuals with names like \"COSMOS\" and \"SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICE.\" \nOne laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn GUARD, who's finishing his sentence. \nGUARD (on screen) --and it did not go off in twenty-one! \nLUTHER turns to a screen on another computer and searches through a complex facilities menu. \nLUTHER (mouths) Twenty-one, twenty-one -- \nHe finds what he's looking for and double clicks on it.  A red box on his screen lights up -- \nINT. CIA LANGLEY - LOBBY - DAY \n-- and the same red box lights up on the GUARD'S screen. From in the distance, a new ALARM begins to wail. \nGUARD RANDALL Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go. \nETHAN Let's move! \nETHAN turns and looks at one of the FIREMEN behind them -- it's CLAIRE.  CLAIRE and KRIEGER follow ETHAN/GUARD to corridor. \nINT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY \nCLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing a business suit underneath.  She clips an ID tag to her breast pocket. \nShe pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer printout of a man's ID photo.  She stares at the face, studying it. \nINT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY \nCLAIRE, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters building. \nShe sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper.  It's the man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  She sits next to him. \nHe looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then goes back to his paper. \nHe turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a perfume sampler.  She dumps the clear liquid contents into his coffee.  He turns back and hands her part of the paper. CLAIRE smiles. \nCOFFEE MAN drinks up.  CLAIRE stares at his shoulder strangely.  He notices. \nShe reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. \nHe smiles.  But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of shiny gray metallic tape.  CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE MAN drinks up and leaves the table. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nLUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a blueprint of the inside of the building.  A cursor begins to flash in one of the rooms.  LUTHER smiles. \nLUTHER Hi there. \nINT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY \nA GUARD carrying an MP5, a handheld machine gun, leads ETHAN and KRIEGER to a heavy metal door marked SERVICE. \nGUARD Air conditioning's through here! \nThey turn a corner, walking directly past -- \n-- COFFEE MAN, who's coming the other way.  We stay with COFFEE MAN. \nINT. CIA LANGLEY - CORRIDORS - DAY \nCOFFEE MAN comes out of the cafeteria, walks down the corridor. he goes to the restricted access door, taps the control panel. \nCIA ANALYST William Donloe. \nCOFFEE MAN (ANALYST) walks past a GUARD desk and peers into an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where we've seen COFFEE MAN before.  He's the TECHNICIAN who works at the secured computer terminal. \n", "test3_input": "INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY \nETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN putting the mask in a bag. \nThe GUARD returns. \nGUARD Where's the other guy? \nThe GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. \nETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - \n-- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S face in warning. \nETHAN Zero body count. \nKRIEGER (a threat) We'll see. \nETHAN Time up. \nETHAN releases him and walks away. \nINT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY \nThe Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the duct system. \nThe first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right. \nETHAN 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm going in.  Don't disappoint me...Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct.  A laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. \nHe can see the computer room below and the top of the TECHNICIAN'S head. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nIn the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- sided, pyramid shaped glass object. \nETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what it is -- a prism. \nThe laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the shaft. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nUp in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. \nThe screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. \nThe screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. \nIt turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. \nA rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room. \nINT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nThe TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the terminal room. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nIt is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. \nNow ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair falling in front of him. \nAt first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand. \nHe is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the ANALYST enters the room. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nThe TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack of work to his right. \n", "test3_true": "The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer.  He pauses and wipes some sweat from his forehead. \nINT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nWith a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- \nTECHNICIAN Oh, God. \n-- he vomits. \nHe reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  Puzzled, sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY \nEven sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the alarm systems with a card-key.  They HUM back to life efficiently, a light flashing: \nINTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON \nINT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in front of the computer. \nA heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nKRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out on his forehead. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nUnfortunately, he's three feet away from it.  He stretches his arms but can't reach. \nHe blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a situp and looks up, into the shaft. \nINT. DUCT - DAY \nKRIEGER sees the predicament. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it. \nHe closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nIn the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what ETHAN sees. \nHe cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper.  We hear only the moist, airy sound of his breath, not the words. \nLUTHER Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.  Go to the files menu, find the NOC list file.  Open \"NOC List.\"  Put your diskette in.  Double click on the NOC list. \nINT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly.  He reaches out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it and starts typing, softly. \nThe computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive. \nThe computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances. \nBut no alarms go off. \nINT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY \nLUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint.  He WHISPERS more commands. \nLUTHER Ok, good!  It's scrolling.  0K, now we're going to download.  Edit menu.  Select \"copy to disc\".  You're downloading. When it's all green it's done. \nINT.

{"test1_input": "LUKE First off, that woman. We didn't go all the way, you know? \nKEENAN Yeah?   Okay, so? \nLUKE You think technically I'm still a virgin? \nKEENAN Were you inside her? \nLUKE Yeah. \nKEENAN It counts.     Next.   ...What? \nLUKE I been havin' this weird dream. The thing is, I think maybe the dream's real. Forget it. No way I'm tellin' you. \nKEENAN You know enough of my secrets to get me shot. Sharon's mom on Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream is there you can't tell me? \nLUKE It's about part of me gettin' smaller. An important part. \nKeenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then realizes Luke's serious. \nKEENAN You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin' me. You're not thirteen! \nLUKE Screw you.     Maybe I caught something. \nKEENAN I think it's good you bought this truck. \nThey both LAUGH. \nINT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY \nA small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts. \nLuke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke. \nMAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag. \nDripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he occasionally REVS for emphasis. \nMAX I can do the gasket for twenty bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this thing? Two, three hundred, maybe? \nLUKE Shit.    Can I hold off on that? \nMAX No skin off my ass. But a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow. \nLUKE Ah, Jeez.     I shouldn't got this. \nMax considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and SIGHS. \nMAX Four hundred seventy-five horsepower. Twenty-eight inch wheels. It's a classic. Let me dig around out back. Maybe we got a used set. \nLUKE That'd be great.   Thanks. \nMax disappears through a squeaky door at the back. \nLuke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender. \nHe sits, impatient for Max to return. \nHe examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque- wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of Max. \nHe spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T- shirt, with warm, confident eyes. \nLuke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets down the torque-wrench. \nLUKE (CONT'D) It's not my wrench. It's my truck. \nMICHELLE What's wrong with it? \nLUKE Oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple T-sprocks. The flanges are sheared off.   No big deal. \nMICHELLE You have to watch my brother, Max. He's sellin' you \"T-sprocks?\" \nLUKE Yeah? \n", "test1_true": "LUKE From New York. Poli-Sci transfer. I sort of asked around campus. \nMICHELLE You did? \nLUKE You've prob'ly already got a stalker, huh? \nMICHELLE No. \nLuke stares, awkward. \nLUKE You heard about Cafe Lunizia? Italian? They got New York style pizza. Make you feel at home. \nMICHELLE You askin' me out? \nLUKE Oh, well, uh, -definitely! \nAn SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls over to Luke as he pumps gas. \nCHAD Hey, Spanky, let's go! Look forward to kickin' your puck ass. \nLUKE My ride. \nMICHELLE Your name's \"Spanky?\" \nLUKE No, Puck Ass, but people just call me Luke. We're beatin' his frat boy team in street hockey. Pisses 'em off. \nMICHELLE I'll talk to Max. Tell him to just replace the gasket. \nLuke's BREATHING grows HEAVIER. \nLUKE Thanks. So, what do you think? I'll just sit there while you eat. I won't even talk. \nMICHELLE Look, I just split up with this total amoeba. \nLUKE Oh, I'm a paramecium. That's way more evolved. I'm practically pond scum. \nMICHELLE Maybe I'll give you a call when the truck's ready. \nLUKE Great.    You mean to go out, right? \nMichelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at the back. Keenan approaches. \nKEENAN (a whisper) Whoa. That was her!     Jesus, you're sweatin' like crazy. \nLuke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes BEADS of SWEAT from his brow. \nLUKE We're goin' out. \nKeenan gives him a high-five.    Luke smiles, catching his breath. \nINT. LUKE & KEENAN'S PLACE \nA small, run-down house. Hockey gear, dirty laundry and Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa. He munches a burrito while watching the game. \nLUKE (O.S.) KEENAN!   COME HERE, QUICK!!! \nKeenan leaps up. \nKEENAN WHAT?! \nHe races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum. \nBATHROOM \nLuke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the mirror, horrified. \nLUKE Look!   My chest! \nKeenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now. \nKEENAN Yeah? \n", "test1_id": 1221, "test2_input": "LUKE I had hair. Come on! Not a lot, but you've seen me -some- right? \nKEENAN Okay, I don't know.    So? \nLUKE Well, where'd it go? \nKeenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed. \nKEENAN I really thought you gettin' laid was gonna' help. What is it with you, man? I mean, you're smarter than me, you're better lookin' than me. \nLUKE I am not. \nKEENAN I know. But I'm just sayin', you can get any girl you want. \nLUKE Easy for you, you've got Janine. \nKEENAN I'm still workin' on my GED. How long you think Brainiac's gonna' wanna' hang with that? \nLUKE She worships you. \nKEENAN Man, I'm gonna' be that wild fling she had with the local dude from the bike shop. \"God, what was his name?\" \nLUKE You're crazy. \nKeenan gives him a look of \"I'm crazy?\" \nKEENAN You're gonna' have a great time with her tonight. Just be yourself. ...Mostly. \nEXT. CAFE LUNIZIA - NIGHT \nCheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung with far too many white lights. \nMICHELLE I caught him with my best friend. Former. Such a cliche'. \nLUKE Sorry. \nMICHELLE Winthrop Hawkins. \"Hawk.\" From this Park Avenue family. He'd know what kind of mushrooms those are, what the best wine is. \nLUKE The best wine is beer. \nMICHELLE I'm such a moron. \nLUKE You're not. \nMICHELLE No, I am.    I have incontrovertible proof. \nShe kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table, a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) It's a hawk. Get it? \"Hawkins?\" See, you're smirking! \nLUKE I'm not. \nMICHELLE And it's GREEN! That's the one color tattoo they can't REMOVE! \nLUKE Oh.   Bummer. \nMICHELLE I'm considering a prosthetic foot. \nShe smiles. \nThey sip from their glasses and drink each other in. \nLuke contemplates a kiss,... \nbut his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) What's the matter? \nLUKE Nothin'. Maybe just kind a' hot out here. You want moron? When my dad died, -it's okay, I was nine. I barely knew what was goin' on- But I thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so I painted smiley faces and fish all over it. \nMICHELLE That's sweet. \nLUKE Yeah, I'm sure dad would've loved that. \n", "test2_true": "MICHELLE So, what do you think makes a good relationship? \nLUKE For real? I don't know. Friendship. Great sex. Knowing you want to be there even when it gets scary or bloody. \nMICHELLE Whoa.     Where'd that come from? \nLUKE Sorry. \nMICHELLE No, it's just not the usual guy thing. ...You're great, you know? \nLuke puts his hand on his chest, FEELS something. \nHe stands, puts on his jacket. \nLUKE Will you excuse me a sec'? \nNEAR THE KITCHEN \nHYPER-VENTILATING, his arms CLUTCHING HIS CHEST, \nBEADS OF SWEAT on his forehead, \nLuke checks the Men's Room door: LOCKED. \nHe ducks out the service entrance. \nEXT. PARKING LOT By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head, WHIPS off his jacket and shirt, and looks down... \nHis eyes GO WIDE. \nLUKE -AAH! \nOn his chest: FEMALE BREASTS. \nTwo WAITERS come outside for a smoke. \nFIRST WAITER Table twenty-nine. Like to bring her the cannoli special. \nLuke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a HIGH FEVER, and PASSES OUT, slumping to the ground. \nBEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT \nLuke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the ground, shirtless among bits of garbage. \nHe watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory: \nHe GRABS his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal. \nHe stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck. \nEXT. WOODED HIGHWAY - LATE NIGHT \nLuke's Semi THUNDERS along. \nINSIDE THE CAB \nLuke stares out in shock. \nHe hears HEAVY BREATHING, MOANS, VOICES. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Oh yes!   Don't stop! \nHe looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over. \nRIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR \nin it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Lie down for me, baby! \nThe HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him. \n", "test2_id": 1222, "test3_input": "MAX What's the point? It never works out. Or they just cheat on you anyway. \nPOLLY Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when I was your age. A boulevard of broken hearts. But eventually, I found him. \nShe sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket. \nPOLLY (CONT'D) Scratch.   Then he died. \nMAX Sorry. \nPOLLY Everything reminded me of him. So, I came here, half way round the world to forget. Then created this place, just like the one where we met. \nMAX He can't handle this. Us.   He can't handle who he is. \nPOLLY You being a guy too? \nMAX Or him being a girl. \nPolly's confused, but presses on. \nPOLLY Everyone's terrified. But once you really know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole. \nMAX No one wants to know who I really am. \nPOLLY You're so sure? \nMAX It's impossible. He was the one person I thought could understand. But no, it's impossible. \nMax puts the cue stick down, and moves off.    Polly calls after,... \nPOLLY It's worth finding out. \nEXT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON \nMax slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag. \nLUCA Hey. \nMAX Hey. \nLUCA I know she doesn't want to talk to me. But do you know where I can find her? \nMAX New York.     Left two days ago. \nLUCA Oh, man.    ...You're staying? \nMAX Just 'til Friday. \nMax returns to his work. \nLUCA I wanted to apologize to her. Forget it, I don't know,... Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but I just wish she knew how much I, -and that I wasn't cheating, I was just trying to be a man for her. (laughs) She'd have a field day with that one, huh? \nMAX True. \nLUCA If you talk to her, please just tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her the best,... everything. \nMAX Thanks. \nLuca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response. \nLUCA I'm sorry.     To you too. \nMAX For what? \nLUCA Mixed signals, I guess. \nMax walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing. \nMAX Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch! \nLUCA You all right? \nMAX Stepped on a nail.    Damn it! \n", "test3_true": "MAX (CONT'D) So, you gettin' used to this at all? \nLUCA I wish. \nMAX You definitely had me confused. \nLUCA For whatever it's worth.     I think you're a pretty hot guy. \nMAX Thanks.   But you're not interested? \nLUCA Truth is, I am. And I guess it sounds crazy, but I couldn't do that to Michelle. \nLuca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock. \nMAX For whatever it's worth, I think you're pretty hot too. \nLUCA Thanks. \nMAX Too bad you're a moron. \nLUCA Excuse me? \nMAX I have incontrovertible proof. \nLuca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the TATTOO OF A GREEN BIRD. \nMax meets her eyes, \nand it finally dawns on Luca, \nstanding, in shock, and now putting it all together, \nshe LUNGES for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him. \nShe RIPS Max's T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking over oil cans. \nPassion.   Unbridled. \nIN THE PARTS YARD \nLuca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge tires, as Max's face transforms... \nBY OLD RADIATORS \nMichelle slams back onto the crabgrass. She pulls Luca toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke. \nBY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS \nLuke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing, \nTRANSFORMING as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and Luke and Luca -or was that Max? \nINT. MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nWhite gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. The sun's first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows. \nMichelle stirs slowly, then BOLTS AWAKE.       She grabs Luke, a vise grip around his torso. \nHe awakens, groggy. \nLUKE Hey you.    ...Good morning.   What's up? \nMichelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him. \nLUKE (CONT'D) You still think I'm going to bolt, don't you? \nMICHELLE And leave me stuck. \nHe smiles. \nLUKE What do you want, a gender pre-nup? \n", "test3_id": 1223}

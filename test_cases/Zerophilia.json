{"train": "ZEROPHILIA \nWritten by \nMartin Curland \nRevised: March 1, 2004 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT \nMist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the distance. \nThe full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN, splashing a one man pup tent. \nINSIDE THE TENT \nLUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly awkward and unaware he's growing handsome. \nHe listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer. \nHe peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS himself against the side of the tent, as... \nOUTSIDE \nan RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop in the mud. \nStillness. \nLuke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver- side window of the RV. \nLUKE Are you all right? \nInside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed. She nods 'yes.' \nLUKE (CONT'D) How did you even get here?       There's no road. \nALEXA I'm sorry.     I'm from Utah. \nLUKE It's okay. \nALEXA Are you alone out here? \nHe nods 'yes.'    She bursts into TEARS. \nALEXA (CONT'D) My husband. Bastard. I've been driving for days. I don't even know where I'm going. \nLUKE Oh, wow.    I'm really sorry. \nShe gathers herself, sniffling. \nI have warm apple kringel in the camper. Would you like some? \nLUKE Uh, what is it? \nALEXA Pastry. \nINSIDE RV CAMPER \nLuke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry off a paper plate. \nALEXA So, this \"Survival Quest\" is your vacation? \nLUKE Yeah. It's my third try.     Kind a' lame, huh? \nALEXA No. Seven days alone in the wilderness?   I'd be afraid. \nLUKE It's just something I really wanted to do. \nLuke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink. \nALEXA His shoes. Fishing lures.        The electric drill. \nLUKE First off, that woman. We didn't go all the way, you know? \nKEENAN Yeah?   Okay, so? \nLUKE You think technically I'm still a virgin? \nKEENAN Were you inside her? \nLUKE Yeah. \nKEENAN It counts.     Next.   ...What? \nLUKE I been havin' this weird dream. The thing is, I think maybe the dream's real. Forget it. No way I'm tellin' you. \nKEENAN You know enough of my secrets to get me shot. Sharon's mom on Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream is there you can't tell me? \nLUKE It's about part of me gettin' smaller. An important part. \nKeenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then realizes Luke's serious. \nKEENAN You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin' me. You're not thirteen! \nLUKE Screw you.     Maybe I caught something. \nKEENAN I think it's good you bought this truck. \nThey both LAUGH. \nINT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY \nA small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts. \nLuke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke. \nMAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag. \nDripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he occasionally REVS for emphasis. \nMAX I can do the gasket for twenty bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this thing? Two, three hundred, maybe? \nLUKE Shit.    Can I hold off on that? \nMAX No skin off my ass. But a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow. \nLUKE Ah, Jeez.     I shouldn't got this. \nMax considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and SIGHS. \nMAX Four hundred seventy-five horsepower. Twenty-eight inch wheels. It's a classic. Let me dig around out back. Maybe we got a used set. \nLUKE That'd be great.   Thanks. \nMax disappears through a squeaky door at the back. \nLuke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender. \nHe sits, impatient for Max to return. \nHe examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque- wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of Max. \nHe spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T- shirt, with warm, confident eyes. \nLuke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets down the torque-wrench. \nLUKE (CONT'D) It's not my wrench. It's my truck. \nMICHELLE What's wrong with it? \nLUKE Oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple T-sprocks. The flanges are sheared off.   No big deal. \nMICHELLE You have to watch my brother, Max. He's sellin' you \"T-sprocks?\" \nLUKE Yeah? \nLUKE I had hair. Come on! Not a lot, but you've seen me -some- right? \nKEENAN Okay, I don't know.    So? \nLUKE Well, where'd it go? \nKeenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed. \nKEENAN I really thought you gettin' laid was gonna' help. What is it with you, man? I mean, you're smarter than me, you're better lookin' than me. \nLUKE I am not. \nKEENAN I know. But I'm just sayin', you can get any girl you want. \nLUKE Easy for you, you've got Janine. \nKEENAN I'm still workin' on my GED. How long you think Brainiac's gonna' wanna' hang with that? \nLUKE She worships you. \nKEENAN Man, I'm gonna' be that wild fling she had with the local dude from the bike shop. \"God, what was his name?\" \nLUKE You're crazy. \nKeenan gives him a look of \"I'm crazy?\" \nKEENAN You're gonna' have a great time with her tonight. Just be yourself. ...Mostly. \nEXT. CAFE LUNIZIA - NIGHT \nCheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung with far too many white lights. \nMICHELLE I caught him with my best friend. Former. Such a cliche'. \nLUKE Sorry. \nMICHELLE Winthrop Hawkins. \"Hawk.\" From this Park Avenue family. He'd know what kind of mushrooms those are, what the best wine is. \nLUKE The best wine is beer. \nMICHELLE I'm such a moron. \nLUKE You're not. \nMICHELLE No, I am.    I have incontrovertible proof. \nShe kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table, a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) It's a hawk. Get it? \"Hawkins?\" See, you're smirking! \nLUKE I'm not. \nMICHELLE And it's GREEN! That's the one color tattoo they can't REMOVE! \nLUKE Oh.   Bummer. \nMICHELLE I'm considering a prosthetic foot. \nShe smiles. \nThey sip from their glasses and drink each other in. \nLuke contemplates a kiss,... \nbut his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) What's the matter? \nLUKE Nothin'. Maybe just kind a' hot out here. You want moron? When my dad died, -it's okay, I was nine. I barely knew what was goin' on- But I thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so I painted smiley faces and fish all over it. \nMICHELLE That's sweet. \nLUKE Yeah, I'm sure dad would've loved that. \nSYDNEY Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid. \nLUKE Excuse me? \nSYDNEY Why in the world do guys say \"it sucks\" as if it were a bad thing? I mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? So, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. \"What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just SUCK?,\"... \"You won an Olympic Gold Medal?!, that BLOWS!\" \nLUKE I guess you're right. \nSYDNEY It must be great at your age. That river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! How about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic Gold? \nLUKE No thanks.     Jeez, lady. \nDisappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door. \nSYDNEY I ought to dye my hair.      Don't you think? \nLUKE Uh, I don't know.    Looks fine. \nSYDNEY Your hair is such an incredible color. \nLUKE It's brown. \nSYDNEY I love it. Do you think I could cut just a little piece? Match the color? It really \"sucks.\" \nLUKE Nah, c'mon. You're messin' with me. \nSYDNEY I'm not. I love it. You really should get rid a' that thing, anyway. I have clippers in my bag. \nLUKE What thing? \nSYDNEY Cowlick. Right here.     See?   I can just snip it off. \nShe SNIPS his hair.    Luke pulls away. \nLUKE Hey. \nSYDNEY What's the matter? Don't you like being touched? Don't you like being a guy? \nLUKE No. I mean,... What?      Sorry, but you're just bizarre. \nShe CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter. \nSYDNEY May be. But I learned long ago, you can't change your true nature, even if it can change you. \nAs she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle. \nEXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DUSK \nAcres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm lights inside. \nParked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and Luke's Semi. \nINSIDE POOL HALL \nSmoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls. \nKeenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables. \nLUKE Holy shit. It's that lady from the store! Grey and black at the bar. \nKeenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon. \nRENTAL COUNTER \nJanine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from the worldly British owner, POLLY. \nShe runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the bar. \nPOLLY That boy, Keenan, still giving you trouble? \nJANINE Actually, I tried exactly what you said. \nPOLLY And...? \nINT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - LATE NIGHT \nOn a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment. \nKeenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.   Luke keeps one hand down his pants for reassurance. \nSYDNEY In the world?   A hundred. A thousand. There's no way to know. It doesn't show up in any normal DNA test. It's triggered when you first have sex. \nLUKE The woman in the RV! \nKEENAN (dark) From Utah. \nSYDNEY Now, you're Morphescent whenever you're aroused. \nKEENAN You tellin' me this is gonna' happen any time he gets the hots for a girl? \nKeenan looks over at Luke... \nKEENAN (CONT'D) Man, this could be a problem. \nLUKE Is there a cure? \nSYDNEY It's not a disease!    But there are steps you can take. \nLUKE Well, what are they? \nSYDNEY Take it easy. You can't rush this. Before anything, you need to try going all the way. \nKEENAN \"All the way?\" \nSYDNEY You need to turn all the way into a female. \nLUKE You out of your mind?! \nSYDNEY You have to give it a try. \nKEENAN Maybe we should get a second opinion. \nLUKE Yeah, may be! 'Cause you can FORGET THAT! \nSYDNEY Fine, but I warn you, they've never seen this before. First, they'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications, surgery, electroshock therapy, -god knows what. \nKEENAN If he were to try goin' all the way, then what? \nLuke glares at him. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) I'm just askin'. \nLUKE It ain't gonna' happen! \nSYDNEY Oh, for Chris' sake! I'm trying to help you. That Z chromosome's not latent anymore! You don't get control a' that thing, you don't know when it's going to kick in, what it's gonna' do! You want to end up with three left breasts, behemoth hips and one testicle?! \nLuke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect. \nSydney calms herself down. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Now, there's no reason for that to happen. Sorry. You're not the only one who didn't get any sleep. Now, are you going to let me help, or not? \nKEENAN How would he even do that?   Go all the way, I mean? \nSYDNEY He's a Z. (to Luke) You become Morphescent when you get turned on. You can change all the way when you have an orgasm. \nLUKE With who? \nSYDNEY I'm available. \nLUKE No way! \nSYDNEY Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this stage, you don't really need anyone else. \nLUKE Huh? \nSydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off. \nJANINE C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play with their pucks. \nBEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER \nLuke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and realizes... \nSOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN. \nPanicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it, \nEverything's normal. \nOr is it? \nHe frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,... \nHe slumps back against the logs, \nWAVES OF RELIEF. \nINT. LUKE'S HOUSE - DAY \nLuke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after. \nLUKE You TOLD HER?! \nKEENAN I had to. You know Janine.   She knew somethin' was up. \nJANINE I've read about this kinda' thing, but I didn't think it was real. It's so cool! \nLUKE It's disgusting! \nJANINE How can you say that? If I had a chance to be a guy for a day, I'd jump at it. Seriously, Keen, wouldn't you want to get inside a girl's body? \nRealizing she just handed him the perfect straight line... \nJANINE (CONT'D) Don't EVEN go there! (rolling her eyes) Fine. You're boys. Still, isn't it every guy's dream to have a pair of boobs to play with anytime he wants? \nLUKE Not my own! (to Keenan) Man, how could you tell her?! \nKEENAN She should be here. It's just weird, two guys alone, one turnin' into a girl. \nJANINE Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly something you get to see every day. \nLUKE Forget it! \nJANINE What, HE gets to, and I don't! \nLUKE No one gets to! \nLuke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door. \nKeenan and Janine take up residence outside. \nJanine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door. \nJANINE Should we put on some soft music? \nKEENAN You want a magazine in there? \nLUKE (O.S.) Shut up! \nLATER \nJanine keeps an ear held close against the door. \nKEENAN How 'bout a couple beers? \nJANINE Maybe you want to take a bath? \nLUKE (O.S.) Will you PLEASE shut up?! \nJANINE Does he sound different? \nFemale Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror. \nFEMALE LUKE This is too weird. This is freaking me out. \nKEENAN Should we call Dr. Catchadourian? \nFEMALE LUKE What for? I did it. Now, I can switch back. Get outta' here. \nJANINE Already? \nKEENAN Yeah, okay, yeah. \nJANINE Will you stop starin'?! \nJanine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the room, their eyes locked on her amazing body. \nOUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER \nJanine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch. \nLuca opens the door. \nFEMALE LUKE Janine? It's like I can't get in the right mood or something. \nJANINE Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no one could in this situation. \nFEMALE LUKE You gotta' help. I need to do this right now! \nJANINE You can't force these things. \nKEENAN Some girls go half their lives before they even have one. \nJANINE Okay, Studly, what do you suggest? \nKEENAN She likes it when I tell her stuff. \nJANINE Like what? \nKEENAN \"You're so beautiful,\" \"I love your smile,\" \"The English Patient was my favorite movie too.\" \nJanine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.       Female Luke swings the door shut. \nThe DOORBELL CHIMES. \nFEMALE LUKE (O.S.) Who's that?! \nKEENAN Pizza!   Figured you'll want some after. \nFRONT DOOR \nJanine throws it open, Max stands outside. \nMAX Hey. \nJANINE Can I help you? \nMAX I was lookin' for Luke. \nKEENAN Hey, man. He's not around right now. What's up? \nFemale Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet. \nFEMALE LUKE Thank God.     I'm starving! \nShe stops in her tracks, stares at Max. \nMax stares back, intrigued. \nMAX How ya' doin'? \nFemale Luke nods 'okay.' \nMAX (CONT'D) I'm Max.    You live here too? \nJANINE (shrugs) He's a hunk. \nLUCA I got to switch back.    Right now! \nJANINE What's the big deal? \nLUCA Get out of here!     Just GET OUT! \nJANINE Okay, okay. \nOUTSIDE BEDROOM \nJanine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.    He looks up at her, questioning. \nKEENAN What's goin' on? \nJANINE It's a girl thing. \nKEENAN Does he need any help in there? \nJANINE Not from you. \nOUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER \nKeenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door, half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY. \nBUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom. \nLUCA (O.S.) This is good! \nKeenan and Janine PERK UP. \nKEENAN Finally. \nJANINE Alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,... and flip that center thingy back... \nKeenan finds this particularly unsettling. \nLUCA (O.S.) (enthused) Did you get this thing at the mall? \nJANINE No. \nKEENAN Janine wouldn't have one a' those. \nJANINE Please. And mine's got way more features than that one. (Keenan's crotch) Or that one. \nKeenan gives her the evil eye. \nLUCA (O.S.) So, where'd you get it? \nJANINE It was Larissa's.    My roommate. \nInside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS. \nLUCA (O.S.) GROSSS!!! \nOUTSIDE DOOR \nKeenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack. \nKEENAN I'm just sayin', he's not that experienced with girls. \nJANINE Oh, and you are? \nKEENAN I'm startin' to wonder if you are? \nJANINE I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies. \nKeenan flips the TV remote, disturbed. \nINSIDE THE BEDROOM \nLuca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated. \nSydney smiles, nods in agreement. \nSYDNEY A lot of guys could use one of those. \nLUKE So, what now? Do I take pills or something? \nSYDNEY No, it doesn't work like that. This may sound odd, but I need to know if you're attracted to me. \nLUKE What?    No. \nSYDNEY Hmm.    You're not gay, are you? \nLUKE NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted to you like that. \nSYDNEY Okay, calm down. This could be a problem. Right now, you can go either way anytime you want. It's a very special and critical time for a Z, something you'll experience only once in life. \nLUKE Good. \nSYDNEY You need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female. \nLUKE What? \nSYDNEY Don't you see? You get to choose. \nLUKE I don't want to choose.   I want to be a guy. \nSYDNEY Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires. It's important to know for sure. \nLUKE Believe me, I know. \nSYDNEY I think you need to try again. \nLUKE No way! \nSYDNEY Why're you so resistant? If the truth is, you want to be a guy, great, but if not... \nLUKE Don't even say that! \nSYDNEY Well, clearly some part of you feels differently. You couldn't change if you didn't want to. \nLUKE What?!    That's crap! \nSYDNEY That's the thing about the truth. It'll set you free, but first it can really piss you off. \nSydney moves to leave. \nLUKE This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a guy! \nSYDNEY Then what's the problem?   You are one. \nSydney turns to leave. \nLUKE You're not gonna' help?! \nSYDNEY I will, the moment you're ready to try again. You can come back to my place right now if you want. \nLUKE Forget it! \nEXT. LUMBER MILL - DAY \nBikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.    Abandoned timber surrounds an asphalt clearing. \nLuke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a friendly, if brutal roller hockey game. \nLuke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs, cheering them on. \nJeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY to score the winning GOAL. \nThe Guys CHEER. \nCHAD Well, ain't we a basket a' biscuits? \nJEREMY Yeah, Luke, what got into you today? \nLuke breaks free of the guys, and moves off. \nINT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN \nSydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with Jeremy. \nJEREMY This shirt? I've had it for years. \nSYDNEY Well, it's very sexy. I love men's clothes. What else have you got in your closet? \nJeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches, her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside. \nJEREMY Polly, are you alright?   Didn't mean to walk in on you. \nPOLLY Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love, tears. That's the trade-off. \nShe puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks behind the bar. \nSYDNEY My God, he's gorgeous. \nPOLLY Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the sweetest boy in the world. Sorry, darling, I'm afraid you'll find he's not your type. \nSYDNEY Oh, we'll see about that. \nPOLLY I think he may prefer men. \nSYDNEY I certainly hope so. \nKeenan and Janine enter. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) You two better have a seat. \nJANINE Is Luke alright? \nSYDNEY He should have full control over this now. Something must be really confusing him. The only thing I can think of... \nKEENAN What? \nSYDNEY When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine? \nJANINE No.   Not me. \nKEENAN Well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me. \nJANINE No.   Definitely not. \nSYDNEY Wasn't it just the two of you? \nJANINE Not exactly. \nJanine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out. \nKEENAN Oh, give me a break! No way! Max?! They just had a huge fight. He tried to beat the crap out of him! \nJanine and Sydney exchange a knowing look. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!   He was just turnin' into a girl! \nJANINE Exactly.   He was a girl. \nKEENAN Oh!   This is just wrong. \nJANINE Would you rather she was attracted to me? \nKEENAN Would you?! \nJANINE Maybe I would! \nSYDNEY Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke needs your help. He needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants. \nJanine nods. \nJANINE So, what's all this mean? \nJANINE NO! I want to know! Just exactly what's wrong with being a girl?! \nLUKE Nothin'! It's great!    It's fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen to BE one! \nJANINE Maybe we should've had this conversation the other afternoon?! \nLUKE That wasn't my choice! \nJANINE I sure as hell didn't make you do it! \nKEENAN Janine, will you just let me talk to him for a sec'? \nJANINE Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!' Give me a fuckin' break! \nJanine storms off with the box. \nKEENAN Sorry, man. She talked me into it. You know Janine. \nKeenan picks up his bike, gets on. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) Look, uh,... you do like bein' a dude, right? \nLUKE Asshole! \nKeenan GRINS, rides off. \nKEENAN (calling back) You should thank me.    The one she picked out was PINK! \nUP THE WALKWAY \nLuke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box mangled inside. \nGlancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the dress out, brushes off some dirt. \nHe shoves it back in the trash, stares at it. \nINT. MINI-MART - NIGHT \nLuke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves. \nThe CHIME BINGS. \nHe peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight. \nMichelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him. \nMICHELLE Hi. \nLUKE Hey.     How are you? \nMICHELLE I'm okay.     You? \nAs they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer. \nLuke maneuvers to keep his distance. \nLUKE Okay.     You look really nice. \nMICHELLE Thanks.    I was hopin' you might call. \nLUKE I was going to. \nMICHELLE There's something I need to talk to you about. -But did I do something wrong? \nLUKE No. Nothin' like that. There's just some stuff I've got to sort out. \nMICHELLE Like what? \nThey gaze at each other across the magazine rack, \na mountain range of silence between them,... \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) There's nothing you can't tell me. \nMichelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray of water, upset. \nSteam rises, filling the bathroom. \nShe begins SINGING, longingly,... \nMICHELLE \"I wanna know how to go To the inside of love. I can't find my way through.\" \nWashing herself, \nbehind the shower curtain, \nthe timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts. \nAs her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes... \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) \"I'm outside of love, To the side or above, I can't find my way with you\" \nA glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows more muscular, \nand her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,... \nas MICHELLE BECOMES MAX. \nMAX \"Must be a special view, Finding a me with a you, On the inside of love.\" \nMax steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror. \nINT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT \nA persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She swings the door open. \nLuke stands outside in POURING RAIN. \nSYDNEY Oh, honey.     Come in. \nBY THE FIREPLACE \nSydney pours hot tea. \nLUKE You're one too.    Why didn't you tell me? \nSYDNEY I didn't want to confuse the issue. \nLUKE So, it's true what you said? You really know. I wouldn't change unless I wanted to? \nSYDNEY Maybe some part of you. \nLUKE What part?    How much of me? I mean, for it to work? Half? More than half? What if it was only a tiny bit, -a thought? \nSYDNEY I don't know. But I believe there may be thousands of Z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. Nothing ever happens. You couldn't keep it from happening. \nLUKE I love being with Michelle. How come I can't control it when she's around? \nSYDNEY I think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over. \nLuke nods sadly. \nLUKE You think I don't really want to be a man. \nSYDNEY I think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are. It was for me. \nLUKE Maybe for me too. \nSYDNEY Right now, you're Morphescent. The key is to have sex with another Z. You become Adulmorphic. Your gender locks. You can't just change anytime you want. \nLUKE Another Z? \nSYDNEY That's why I came all the way out here. \nLUKE And why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack? \nSYDNEY Thought maybe I could save you some distress. But you say you're not attracted to me. For it to work, both of us have to be into it. \nMAX Good. \nLUCA Where'd you learn to speak Italian? \nMAX Just tourist stuff. \"I'll have the spaghetti bolognese.\" \"How much for a room?\" \nLUCA Have you been? \nMAX Little Italy. In New York. Someday, though. Want to go with me? \nMax leans over and KISSES Luca.   She responds, tentatively at first, \nthen as she grows more confident,... \nher face REDDENS, she GASPS. \nLuca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.    She brushes sawdust off her dress, stands. \nLUCA Look, this was a mistake. \nMAX Yeah.   Of course.   I know. \nLooking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the floor, incredulous. \nKeenan exits out through the giant doors. \nLUCA Oh, Jesus... \nMAX Are you and he...? \nLUCA Huh? \nMAX It's really none of my business. \nLUCA No! I'm sorry.    I shouldn't've come here. \nMax stands, brushes off the sawdust. \nMAX Please don't say you're \"just visiting.\" That you \"need to leave.\" I'm the one who needs to leave. \nMax skates off across the giant shop floor. \nEXT. LUMBER MILL - DUSK The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt. From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled down window. \nACROSS THE PARKING LOT \nKeenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists open another beer, which he gulps. \nAT THE TRUCK \nLuke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats and a T-shirt. \nKeenan sits on the running board. \nKEENAN I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?! You do wanna' be a girl? You're into guys now? \nLUKE No! I don't know exactly.    I don't know. \nKeenan downs his beer, pensive.   He crushes the can and hurls it, SMACKING a garbage can. \nKEENAN What about Michelle? \nLUKE I had to be sure. I am now. Come on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I make out with a girl, I start turning into one. You gotta' admit, it's a little weird, isn't it? \nSuddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan stands. \nLUKE (CONT'D) Let's get outta' here.  You want a ride somewhere? Janine's? \nKEENAN Why don't you go see her?   Think you're more her type. \nKeenan picks up his bike. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) I'll see ya' round, okay? \nThe alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF SCREEN... \nSYDNEY (O.S.) Just let yourself go completely. \nLUKE (O.S.) Wow, this is intense. \nSYDNEY (O.S.) When two Z's do it, the lateral hypothalamus gets completely overwhelmed,... \nLUKE (O.S.) OH, MAN!! \nSYDNEY (O.S.) Cellular fission kicks in, and, well,... you can go Zytusional! \nLUKE (O.S.) Unbelievable! \nThe chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly stare. \nLUKE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Oh no.   What's happening? \nLuke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH... \nHALF-LUCA (O.S.) What have you done?! (Luca) NOOOOO!!!! \nThe SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE, \nculminating in the extraordinary, never before heard, \nSOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX... \nLUCA/LUKE AND SYDNEY (O.S.) \nSilence. \nMIRROR - LATER \nA great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears in reflection: MALE SYDNEY. \nBehind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in her mouth. \nMale Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in the mirror. \nMALE SYDNEY (into phone) I hear you're the best. Yes, it's an emergency!   Please. Or I'll have to cut it myself. (to Luca) Now, you look me in the eye, and tell me that wasn't the best sex you ever had. \nLuca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY! \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) (into phone) Half an hour! YES! THANK you! \nMale Sydney clicks the phone off. \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) You can have all my clothes. Oh, and I just bought these incredible Anna Felucci pumps. (reconsiders) Maybe I should keep those. \nMale Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray Italian tux. \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Okay, I wasn't completely honest with you, but I never lied either. It stopped. That is what you wanted.    You're Adulmorphic now. The only way to switch is to do it with another Z. \nHe gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.   He sits on the bed, speaks softly. \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) I know you don't believe me, but this is the right thing for you. Eventually, you'll figure that on your own. But I could tell it was just gonna' take way too long! \nLuca stares, distraught. \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Oh, for Chris' sake. Being a woman doesn't make you any less of a man! \nThe entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles. \nMale Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger... \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Damnit! I can't live my whole LIFE wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake! I'm a man! I love havin' this chest, these arms! But most of all,... (grabs his pant crotch) Welcome home, boys! Hang in there, I'm takin' you out for a SPIN! \nLATER \nLuca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed. \nA KNOCK at the door. \nINSIDE THE SEMI The truck CAREENS around a CURVE. \nLUCA Can't this thing go any faster?! \nLuca considers... \nLUCA (CONT'D) You know me better than anyone. What do you think? \nKEENAN Huh? \nLUCA I mean, if I weren't a hundred percent sure which I'm s'posed to be. If you had to say. \nKEENAN All I know is, every time you look at Michelle, or think about her, you smile. What the hell else do you need to know? \nLUCA It's not right. She deserves to be with a normal guy. \nKEENAN So, you don't get to be with anyone? \nThey drive in silence. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) That why they call it \"zero- philia?\" \nLUCA She's not gonna' want some guy who thinks maybe he's supposed to be a girl sometimes. \nKEENAN How do you know? Did you ask? \nLUCA No way I'm gonna' ask her that. \nKEENAN Well, you have to.   Where are your nads, man?! \nLuca glares at him.   Keenan realizes his mistake... \nKEENAN (CONT'D) We'll get 'em back. \nThe truck ROARS on. \nEXT. POLLY WOG'S \nAs Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill. \nMALE SYDNEY Come on, let's grab a couple beers. \nSydney tugs at his T-shirt. \nMALE SYDNEY (CONT'D) Of course, I see you brought your own six-pack. \nGRAVEL PARKING LOT \nKeenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the crowd. \nJanine waves to Luca and points across the way. \nLuca nods. \nLUCA Let's go! \nKEENAN Jeez.    She won't even look at me. \nThey stride across the field. \nBEHIND THE BARN \nMale Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall. \nMALE SYDNEY I do love to mess with Texas. \nKeenan and Luca appear around the corner. \nLUCA There! \nMALE SYDNEY We better get outta' here. \nKeenan reaches them first.      He wrenches Male Sydney and Jeremy apart. \nLUCA I'm not sure. \nMICHELLE You asshole! \nMichelle moves off. \nALONGSIDE THE BARN \nLuca runs up. \nMICHELLE I don't believe this.    You slept with that guy?! \nLUCA It's not what you think. \nMICHELLE Oh, please! What about Max? \nLUCA What about him? \nMICHELLE Don't you care about him at all?! \nLUCA Not like that: I'm straight!   I'm attracted to you! \nMICHELLE Oh, who cares, you idiot! And sorry to break it to you, but I'm straight too. \nLUCA No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm not who you think I am- \nMICHELLE Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who you are! \nLuca stares, stunned. \nLUCA You know I'm a Zerophiliac?! \nMICHELLE Yes! So you can just go fuck yourself. -Literally! \nLUCA Does Max know who I am? \nMICHELLE What if he does? Do you? \nLUCA He's a guy! \nMICHELLE And you're a girl! \nLUCA I'm not! \nMichelle gestures \"Oh really?!\" \nLUCA (CONT'D) I'm not supposed to be! \nMICHELLE There's no supposed to be anything, you just ARE! \nLUCA Is that what you think?!   NO! \nMICHELLE Well, then congratulations! You're a guy, just like every other guy I ever met! I can't believe you slept with him! \nLUCA He was a woman! I was tricked.   I didn't know I'd switch. \nMichelle stares, incredulous. \nMICHELLE You're gonna' tell me he's a Z too?! Both of you?! \nLUCA Yes! \nMICHELLE Well, that's just perfect. What, is there something in the water around here?! \nLUCA She told me it would make it stop. That it would keep me from turning into a girl. \nMICHELLE So what?! Why's that so important to you?! There's no way this was gonna' work. \nLUCA Because I'm a Zerophiliac. \nMICHELLE Because you can't stand being one! Bye, Luca. \nLUCA (correcting her) Luke. \nMAX What's the point? It never works out. Or they just cheat on you anyway. \nPOLLY Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when I was your age. A boulevard of broken hearts. But eventually, I found him. \nShe sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket. \nPOLLY (CONT'D) Scratch.   Then he died. \nMAX Sorry. \nPOLLY Everything reminded me of him. So, I came here, half way round the world to forget. Then created this place, just like the one where we met. \nMAX He can't handle this. Us.   He can't handle who he is. \nPOLLY You being a guy too? \nMAX Or him being a girl. \nPolly's confused, but presses on. \nPOLLY Everyone's terrified. But once you really know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole. \nMAX No one wants to know who I really am. \nPOLLY You're so sure? \nMAX It's impossible. He was the one person I thought could understand. But no, it's impossible. \nMax puts the cue stick down, and moves off.    Polly calls after,... \nPOLLY It's worth finding out. \nEXT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON \nMax slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag. \nLUCA Hey. \nMAX Hey. \nLUCA I know she doesn't want to talk to me. But do you know where I can find her? \nMAX New York.     Left two days ago. \nLUCA Oh, man.    ...You're staying? \nMAX Just 'til Friday. \nMax returns to his work. \nLUCA I wanted to apologize to her. Forget it, I don't know,... Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but I just wish she knew how much I, -and that I wasn't cheating, I was just trying to be a man for her. (laughs) She'd have a field day with that one, huh? \nMAX True. \nLUCA If you talk to her, please just tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her the best,... everything. \nMAX Thanks. \nLuca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response. \nLUCA I'm sorry.     To you too. \nMAX For what? \nLUCA Mixed signals, I guess. \nMax walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing. \nMAX Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch! \nLUCA You all right? \nMAX Stepped on a nail.    Damn it! \n", "test1_input": "As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from the passing car. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nA glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined. \nThe FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR HORN SCREAMS by. \nLuke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's \nLEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR \nThe car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears. \nTHROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD \nLuke stares out, EYES GLAZED. \nINT. KEENAN AND LUKE'S GARAGE \nThe decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves, slugging a makeshift punching bag. \nKeenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes. \nKEENAN We takin' up boxing? \nLUKE I don't know. I am. \nKEENAN What's goin' on? You competin' for Mr. Universe this week? \nLUKE Everyone should just mind their own fucking business! \nKeenan recoils at the attitude. \nKEENAN Didn't go so great, huh? \nLuke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD RAGE. \nHe collapses in a heap. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) Dude. \nLUKE It was goin' great. She's amazing. Funny. And really smart.    And the way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.' \nKEENAN Cool. \nLUKE Then I started feelin' all weird again, and,... oh, man, you'll think I'm nuts... Keen, I had breasts. I felt 'em. \nKEENAN Whoa, first date.     Definitely the 'new Luke!' \nLUKE No!     On me. \nKEENAN You're startin' to creep me out. Listen, I think I know what's goin' on, okay? \"Acute Adolescent Anxiety.\" It's from the stress of college, girls, grades. It's really common. \nLUKE I'm not an adolescent.    Where'd you get this crap?! \nKEENAN The Net. I found all the symptoms right off: panic attacks, \"Localized Alopecia\" -that's hair loss. This doctor wrote back, \"Any chance your friend, Luke, just lost his virginity?\" \nLUKE You told, -you gave him my name?! \nKEENAN He's a doctor, back East. He's sending this information pack. Look, I started thinkin' you're goin' bipolar on me or somethin'. Come on, man, BREASTS?! \nLuke considers. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell. \nHearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. \nMAX You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell away from my sister! \nLuke GASPS for air. \nMAX (CONT'D) You don't say a word?! You just leave her sittin' there?! \n", "test1_true": "Max shoves him across the yard. \nMAX Get out a' here!   She's not home, anyway. \nLUKE Will you tell her I came by? \nMAX No. She's honest with you, so you bolt? And then what, you wake up feelin' sorry for her? \nLUKE No! Is that what she thinks?   I left 'cause a' what she said? That's crazy! She's like the most incredible girl I ever met! \nMax sneers, skeptical. \nLUKE (CONT'D) I had this 'pasta quattro funghi' - four mushroom. It took me a while to even figure it out, but I think someone put shrooms in it, or somehow they got in there by mistake. I was hallucinating and everything. \nMAX Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to be a world-class asshole. Fortunately, I'm familiar with the cause. \nLUKE Will you please just tell her I came by? Forget it. I'll catch up with her on my own. \nMAX No.    You won't. \nLUKE Look, I'm gonna' see her again, -if she'll see me. I don't care what the fuck you say about it. \nMAX Oh, really? \nThey face off. \nLUKE Yeah, really. \nMAX You get near her, I'll feed your nuts to the neighbor's dog! \nLUKE What kind a' dog is it? \nMAX Huh? \nLUKE I mean, is it a pitbull, or what? \nCaught off guard, a smile escapes Max. \nLUKE (CONT'D) I'm crazy about her. \nMAX Shrooms, huh? \nLuke nods 'yes.' \nMAX (CONT'D) I'll tell her you came by. \nLuke nods, appreciative. \nEXT. MUDDY WATERS' MINI-MART - NIGHT \nA tanker truck QUAKES past. Surrounded by fir trees, the eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food. \nINSIDE MINI-MART \nLuke stands behind the cash register, leafing through \"The Outdoors Man.\" \nThe CHIME BINGS and SYDNEY enters, early thirties, elegant in thrift-store chic. She's cool and in control, ...at least on the outside. \nShe surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke. \nSYDNEY Had a sudden intense craving for a cherry popsicle. \nLUKE You can check in that freezer. \nSYDNEY What a relief. I'm Sydney.    You? \nLUKE Luke. \nSYDNEY Workin' late, huh?   Luke? \nLUKE Yeah, four AM. It sucks. \n", "test2_input": "KEENAN What're you talkin' about? \nSYDNEY Chromosomes. Most people have forty-six: Two X if you're a girl, an X and Y if you're a guy. He's got forty seven: An X, a Y, and a Z. \nPOOL TABLE \nJanine and Michelle select pool cues. \nJANINE We've only been together six months. And he's such a guy's guy, everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six months in \"Juvey.\" \nMICHELLE Wild past, huh? \nJANINE I think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him. \nMICHELLE You. \nJANINE No. He doesn't trust me at all. Luke. He's a rock. \nMICHELLE Yeah? \nJANINE So, yes, you can trust him. I'm hoping Keenan's the same way. 'Cause believe me, I'm not used to rocks, I'm used to pebbles. \nMichelle LAUGHS. \nMICHELLE Grains of sand. \nLuke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern. \nJANINE Everything okay? \nKEENAN Sure.   I need a drink. \nKeenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) (aside to Luke) That lady's nuts. \nLuke nods. \nAT THE BAR \nSydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a slight Texas drawl. \nJEREMY Another round? \nSYDNEY Please. You see that couple over there? I don't get it. What's he see in her? \nJEREMY The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd give my left one to be with her. \nSYDNEY Yeah?   So could he. \nPOOL TABLE - LATER \nNow alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then catches Michelle's admiring eyes. \nShe smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by the jukebox. \nMICHELLE Your friends sorta' like each other, huh? \nLUKE Super-glue. Thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart. \nMICHELLE How'd they meet? \nLUKE Keenan sold her a bike. I don't think they've been apart more than six hours since. \nLuke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot and sink the ball. \nLUKE (CONT'D) I never thought in a million years you'd go out with me, let alone twice. \nMICHELLE You're not s'posed to say that. That's a total pathetic, loser thing to say. But I'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) Okay, two word answers only. Why'd you ask me out in the first place? \nLUKE Beautiful. Unpretentious.     Why'd you say 'yes?' \n", "test2_true": "Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) ...Hot.   Deep.   Three words. \nHe smiles. \nLUKE Okay, two words. What're you most passionate about? \nMICHELLE Friendship. Trust.     You? \nLUKE Hockey.   ...Hockey. \nMICHELLE So much for \"deep.\" \nThey LAUGH. \nLUKE You. \nThe electricity between them charges the air. \nLuke maneuvers himself closer. \nLUKE (CONT'D) Okay, I'm gonna' take a wild shot. Ricochet off the back, over here, then straight into that side pocket. What are my chances? \nMICHELLE Point zero zero zero one. \nLuke takes his shot,... \nand KISSES HER. \nThe ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks in the pocket at the side. \nAT THE BAR \nJeremy looks on, aroused.        Sydney squints, dismayed, barely able to watch. \nJEREMY Damn. Will you look at that tonsil hockey? \nSYDNEY I'd prefer not. This could get bad. \nJEREMY You've been staring at him all night. You got a thing for him, or what? \nSYDNEY Actually, I'm hoping he's got one for me. \nPOOL TABLE \nKeenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated. \nKEENAN Looks like you two are gettin' on okay. Should we rack up another game? \nMICHELLE Definitely! I'd like to get good at this pool thing. \nLuke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue. \nMICHELLE (CONT'D) Okay, I'm gonna' break this wide open! \nLUKE Go for it! \nBefore Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack, \nMichelle HAMMERS the cue ball. \nIt CRACKS off the rack, \nROCKETS off the table,... \nand CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH. \nKeenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP. \nThey CRINGE, poised, waiting for Luke to react. \n", "test3_input": "MICHELLE God.    Sorry. \nLuke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table. \nHe sees them watching him. \nLUKE What? \nKEENAN Man, I'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby. \nLUKE No, I'm all right. \nSurprised, they return to the game. \nMichelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,... \nwith a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right. \nHe casually touches his hand to his pants. \nHe pales slightly. \nLUKE (CONT'D) Would you excuse me a sec'? \nHe looks to Keenan for help. \nAT THE BAR \nSydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the back. \nShe flags Jeremy. \nSYDNEY Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast! (a glance at Luke) Better give me the whole bottle. \nOUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM \nLuke tries the men's room door, locked. \nKEENAN In here. \nKeenan opens another door that leads them into a store room. Luke follows, with a look of concern. \nINSIDE STORE ROOM \nKEENAN (CONT'D) I mean, it was like a precision- guided missile. \nLuke unzips and gently digs in his trousers. \nHe looks down, SHUDDERS,... \nLUKE Uh- ah- \nLuke's face CONTORTS, terrified. \nKEENAN I'll get some ice. \nLuke shakes his head \"no,\" points toward his crotch, GASPS, barely able to make a sound... \nLUKE It's-!     Look! \nKeenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed... \nKEENAN What? \nthen takes a look,... \nHis EYES GET HUGE. \nKEENAN (CONT'D) DUDE!!! \nSydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon. \nSYDNEY I was afraid a' this! (to Keenan) Make sure no one gets in! \n", "test3_true": "Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.   Each time the horror of it grows more intense. \nLUKE Oh, GOD! \nSydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a prescription bottle. \nSYDNEY It's gonna' come back.    Drink this! \nLUKE What're you givin' me?! \nSYDNEY Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload of Darvon. You gotta' calm down. \nLUKE \"Caaalm Down?!!!!!!\" \nSYDNEY Here we go... \nHe and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating MANTRA... \nLUKE \"CAAALM DOWN?!!!\" \nKEENAN What's wrong with him?! \nSYDNEY He's a Zerophiliac. \nKEENAN A what?! I'm gettin' a doctor! This isn't right! \nSydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall. \nSYDNEY I am a doctor! You breathe one word, anyone else sees him like this, and he's fucked! Pictures all over the net, tabloids, television! \nLUKE TELE-VISION?!! \nSYDNEY No!  We're gonna' get it back! (to Keenan) You let me help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life. Now, you his friend or not?! \nKeenan nods that 'yes, he is.'     Sydney releases him. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Hang onto him. So he doesn't get hurt when he passes out. \nKEENAN Now just wait a sec'?     Is it CONTAGIOUS?! \nSYDNEY There are no recorded incidents of transmission from physical contact. \nKEENAN \"Recorded incidents?!!\" \nLUKE Oh, PLEASE God!     What did I DO WRONG?! \nSYDNEY Nothing.   You're a Z. \nKEENAN \"RECORDED INCIDENTS?!\"     Oh my God, I used his deodorant! \nSYDNEY Oh, will you calm down? \nKEENAN \"C A L M    D O W N ?!!!\" \nLUKE \"C A L M    D O W N ?!!!\" \nLuke's eyes glaze over... \nHe weaves, losing his balance... \nSYDNEY Finally. \nSydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.    He passes out. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) He'll be alright. He didn't go all the way. When you fall asleep or pass out, a Z almost always reverts back. It's called a Nocturnal Remission. \nKeenan approaches Luke, then steps back. \nSYDNEY (CONT'D) Oh, relax, it's not contagious. \nKeenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig. \n"}

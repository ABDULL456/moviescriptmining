DAVE Nothing. It's just a name. I made it all up. I was born in Bloomington. I went to Bloomington High. I was the treasurer of the Latin Club and head of the Ushers for our assembly programs...I... 
KATHERINE Stop kidding around. 
DAVE I'm what you call 'a cutter.' F Only I'm not really a cutter either, so I don't know what I am. 
KATHERINE And Napoli...and the big family... Dave just nods that they were all lies. 
KAT IE Well, it was a good act. You certainly fooled me. Cont.

DAVE I just didn't know how else... 
KATHERINE Do you know what you are? 
DAVE No, I haven't a clue. 
KATEINE I'll tell you what you are. 
(STARTS CRYING) I'll tell you. You...You... But she's too upset to tell him anything. She runs inside the classroom. The doors close. Dave stands still. The door opens. Dave smiles as Katherine reappears. She runs up to him and slaps him on the face and then runs back inside. 
CLOSEUP - DAVE His face changes from a guilt-ridden sinner to one of almost anger. Not quite. But there is a hint there of: The hell with her thenI EXT. DAVE' s HOUSE - DAY 155 Mike is holding the Little 500 bike. It's heavy and ungainly in comparison to Dave's Italian racer. Dave looks at the bike. Mike, Cyril and Moocher look at him. 
DAVE Can't I even add some toe-clips? 
MIKE No, it's official issue. They said you can't add or change a thing. 
DAVE It's a piece of junkl 
CYRIL But it's got a nice personality. And it's had its rabies shots already. 
MOOCHER I don't think it looks so bad. 
DAVE That's because you don't have to ride it. Cont.

MOOCHER You don't have to either, Dave. We're not going to beg you. 
CYRIL Plead perhaps, but beg...never. We have our pride. 
MISS The hell with it. At least we got invited. That's something. I'll take it back. He starts to take the bike away. 
DAVE You actually seem relieved, Mike. Mike pauses. 
DAVE You don't think we can win more, do you? Mike is silent. 
DAVE Why not? 
KIKE Well, maybe they are better. 
DAVE I've never heard you say that before. 
MIBE Thatts because I ,never felt it before. 
CYRIL My dad would be proud of you. Our family motto is: It can't be done. 
DAVE We'll see about that. He takes the bike from Mike and starts wheeling it away. He gets on it and rides it into the garage. The guys look at each other. NOISE is HEARD coming from the garage.

INT. MR. BLASE'S GARAGE - DAY 156 
The entire bike is dismantled. The wheels are off. The bearings on the wheels are out. The cranks are off and the crankshaft has been removed. Dave is holding the saddle in his hand. He's pushing down on it. It's very hard.

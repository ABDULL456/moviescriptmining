INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY 
An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF. Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g. 
WADE (V.O.) It puts food on the table. Haven't the people of this town lived hand-to-mouth for long enough? 
INT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY 
FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO. 
WADE (V.O.) We're all gonna die in this hell hole. 
FLOYD Yeah, of boredom. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading Playstation magazine. He listens to the RADIO. 
WADE (V.O.) Wouldn't it be nice not to worry about surviving retirement? Or taking a shot at that life-long dream?

HARLAN It would be nice to get the message out. Let people know the aliens walk among us. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

WADE (V.O.) If Chris McCormick refuses to sell his mines. The rest of us are out of luck. 
Chris frowns. 
INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY 
WADE (V.O.) I don't think it's fair for one person to wield that much power. But he's just like his father. Selfish. Greedy. And more than a little bit nuts. 
SAM Uh-oh. 
Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
The locals stop eating and look toward the radio. 
WADE (V.O.) That family has been digging in those tunnels since the twenties. If there was something down there, don't you think they would have found it by now? 
INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY 
Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio. 
WADE (V.O.) Common sense does not apply to crazy people. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 
WADE (V.O.) Might as well be chasing a leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Chris is furious as he PEELS OUT and speeds toward Harlan's. 
INT. DINER - DAY

You will be safe, my friend. 
GRACE 
We want you to be there tonight. A beat, Costa smiles.     Realizes she's serious. 
COSTA 
No. I'm not meeting him. Absolutely not. You ever go fishing? The bait always dies. 
GRACE 
He won't get within fifty feet of you. The second we see him, the cuffs go on. 
COSTA 
(adamant) Grace, no. 
INT. STAKEOUT VAN - NIGHT 
Costa gives Grace a look as Reynaud tapes a microphone to the BODY ARMOR he is wearing. 
COSTA 
What if he shoots me in the head? 
INSPECTOR REYNAUD 
I will take the bullet for you like the Secret Service. Okay, friend? Reynaud is serious.     Grace helps Costa with his shirt. 
COSTA 
You're good. You could move a lot of art if you wanted to. Their eyes meet for a beat. 
COSTA 
And inspire some too, I'm sure. Right then something very rare happens; Grace blushes. 
INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (1:29 AM) 
Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS.      THE DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT. Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze. Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve- wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger. Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop, pours Costa a Scotch. 
BARTENDER 
Don't worry.   You're doing fine. 
COSTA 
Could you look any more like a cop? 
BARTENDER 
What? 
COSTA 
Could I have some water?    I'm cooking in this thing. Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR. The Bartender gives him a Dasani. VARIOUS ANGLES: A half-dozen UNDERCOVERS are mixed in with the CLUBGOERS. CAMERA FINDS Reynaud sitting at the bar near Costa, gives Costa a reassuring nod through the crowd. 
INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT (1:53 AM) 
Parked outside the club. Grace and Laval watch Costa via the TV built into the dash. 
GRACE 
Costa fits Asher's choice of victims. Travels the World looking for art. Single. No kids or anything. (looking around) Asher's here somewhere. Watching. With all the patience in the world. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
I wish I had his patience. He should be a cop. His mother should be punished. Like the owner of pit bulls that attack kids. 
GRACE 
You got kids? 
INSPECTOR LAVAL 
Three. 
GRACE 
Don't keep them in a cage. 
INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM) 
Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks around. Only sees strange faces. Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN 
THE RESTROOM NOW." 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling.        MUSIC MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his shoulder. No one is watching. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside. Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls. The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down. Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing... Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door. Waiting... Costa freezes.     Backs away as... The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A BLACK MAN emerges.       One of the guys at the end of the bar. Costa exhales.        A bundle of nerves. 
BLACK MAN 
Go outside. Costa eyes him.

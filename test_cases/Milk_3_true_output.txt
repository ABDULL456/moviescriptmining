HARVEY MILK Don't move. Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him. 
SCOTT SMITH I suppose I can wait tables. 
HARVEY No way. I want you right here with me... Did you see place downstairs is for rent? 
SCOTT SMITH Yeah. 
HARVEY MILK I was thinking we could open a shop together. 
SCOTT SMITH What kind of shop? 
HARVEY MILK One with very little overhead. Not too much work... A little one, just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere, New York... 
20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973) 
Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products). Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA." 
HARVEY MILK Just a little to the left... The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome: 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk. 
MCCONNELLY You're the new renters? 
HARVEY MILK Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera. 
Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary. 
HARVEY MILK (CONT'D) I want to join the, um... What is it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's Association. I want to help in any way possible. I'm no interloper. A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll forgive that. McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window. 
MCCONNELLY I don't think your application will be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a family neighborhood. Your kind are far more welcome on Haight street. 
HARVEY MILK (trying to keep it friendly) What "kind" do you mean, sir? 
MCCONNELLY (not playing along) The Merchant's Association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors. 
SCOTT SMITH Based on what law? 
MCCONNELLY There's man's law and there's God's law in this neighborhood and in this City. The San Francisco Police force is happy to enforce either. 
HARVEY MILK (to McConnelly as he walks away) Thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood! 
SCOTT SMITH We pay taxes you know! Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet. 
21 INT. HARVEY AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE -- DAY 
Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized. 
HARVEY MILK We'll form our own business association! Start with the gay- owned businesses... We'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film. We'll ask them what they want to see done here... what they want changed... We'll get money rolling into this neighborhood. Revitalize it... 
SCOTT SMITH Can I come in now? 
HARVEY MILK (O.S.) One more minute! (back to his new scheme) I'll go to the neighborhood banks. They must have some gay customers. 
SCOTT SMITH Harvey. What's with all this political activist crap? I thought you were a goddamn Republican. Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still rambling on to Scott in the bedroom. 
HARVEY MILK I'm a businessman, Scott. I think businesses ought to treat their customers right. Even their gay customers. For God's sake, this is San Francisco! 
SCOTT SMITH Harvey. It's just like every other city in this country. People hate us. Big surprise.

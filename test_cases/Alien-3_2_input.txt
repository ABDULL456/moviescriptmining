JOHN Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that there may be something to what she says. 
ABBOT There isn't. 
The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel, notebook.  John follows him -- 
JOHN I don't understand what you are doing. 
ABBOT This colony is my responsibility.  I am protecting the colony. 
JOHN From what?  This woman?  You never gave her a chance.  How can you be so sure you're right? 
ABBOT A better question is what makes you think I'm wrong? 
JOHN You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it. 
ABBOT (realizes) That's right.  You both did. (beat) And what was it? 
JOHN I -- I don't know what it was.  But I don't think Ripley was a party to it. 
ABBOT She admits she brought it. 
JOHN But she tried to warn us -- 
ABBOT You know that's how the devil works. Deception. 
JOHN But I believe her.  I don't know how to describe it -- A feeling. 
ABBOT You haven't seen a woman in thirty years. Where does this feeling originate, John? 
JOHN (points to his head) Here. 
Pause. 
ABBOT I believe you.  But your feelings are fooling you. 
JOHN It's - It's her conviction.  I just think -- 
The Abbot snaps at him -- 
ABBOT Don't think. 
John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair. Forces a smile. 
ABBOT It's been a long night.  For all of us. You really don't understand what you're dealing with here. 
JOHN That's what she said. 
The Abbot chafes. 
ABBOT These are ideas which threaten the very system we live under.  The creature is dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them. Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere, but leave this alone. 
JOHN But I -- 
ABBOT Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias into the Library, all right?  For your own good, just stay out of this. 
John looks like he's going to protest. 
ABBOT I mean it. 
JOHN (slowly) Yes, Father. 
John turns and leaves the room. The Abbot stares after him. 
INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT 
Dark. Dank. Dreary. A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another. The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered. 
Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM - HAMMERED in tight. 
TWO ANCIENT WORKERS 
Drab, torn gray clothing. Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall. Methodically covering up -- 
RIPLEY 
Watching them work. BAM-BAM-BAM. Defeated. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)

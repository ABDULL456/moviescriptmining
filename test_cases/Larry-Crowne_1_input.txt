JANET As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man." 
TONY What did you say when I asked you out? 
JANET I said "Yes." You were there, remember? 
TONY I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me." 
JANET Yes you are. 
TONY Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it? 
JANET 
Disaster looms on most first dates, but I'm talking to you like you're a friend I want to make out with. 
TONY Hold that thought. Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car. 
Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops. 
DEAN TAINOT I take it back. I take it back. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Drive, asshole! Drive away! 
DEAN TAINOT I've been drinking, too. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline! 
DEAN TAINOT You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and 
WIN! 
MERCEDES TAINOT LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER! 
DEAN TAINOT Screw you, you washboard! 
MERCEDES TAINOT Oh, chillax!!! 
GPS VOICE Please enter your destination. Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now. 
EXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER 
Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She sits and removes her shoes. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear... 
The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time 'Scoot'. All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and Talia. Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the bus stop. She slows. 
TALIA Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop. 
TALIA (CONT'D) You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused. 
BUS BENCH 
Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to her. 
LARRY CROWNE Ms. Tainot? 
MERCEDES TAINOT No. He takes off his helmet. 
LARRY CROWNE 
Larry Crowne. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Jesus Christ. 
TALIA And I've been calling you 'Lance'. 
LARRY CROWNE Do you need a ride? Hop on. 
MERCEDES TAINOT And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi? 
TALIA Hey. Bambi was a boy. 
LARRY CROWNE I was heading home. 
(TO TALIA) Right? We're done scooting? 
TALIA Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens.

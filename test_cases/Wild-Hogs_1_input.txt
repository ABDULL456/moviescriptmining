EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY 
The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys nod in agreement.

EXT. BLANCHARD SPRINGS, OZARK NATIONAL FOREST - LATER 
DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up. 
BOB Thanks for waiting for me, jerks. The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and cannonballs into the water. 
BOB (CONT'D) Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold: He sees DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are just staring at him. 
BOB (CONT'D) What? 
WOODY Why are you naked? 
BOB We're swimming. You guys kept on your skivies? 
DOUG Skivies? What are you, a Newsie? 
DUDLEY I kept mine on because I didn't want everyone to see my crank. 
WOODY 
(TO BOB) Yeah. That, and being naked with a bunch of guys is gay. What's wrong with you? 
BOB I don't know. We took showers and stuff together in college. I thought this was kind of... you know, the same. 
DOUG I guess I get that. 
(THINKS) I mean, we would have been naked in college. Why are we... Oh, man. It's true. We are tamed. We're old guys.

WOODY No, we're not. Don't say that. Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air. 
DOUG I will find old Doug! Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up. 
DUDLEY I will... Do what Doug does! Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers. 
WOODY I will be naked with my gay friends, and if they look at my jock, I will kill them. Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at each other and smile. It's a nice moment. Until a family approaches. Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the family laughs and shakes his head. 
FAMILY DAD Hope you guys don't mind a little company. The mini-van was getting a 
LITTLE-- The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned. 
DOUG Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I 
UH-- 
WOODY There's a shallower spring up the path. The kids might like that even more... The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.

FAMILY MOM 
(TO WOODY) Oh, no. These little squirts like to 
DIVE AND-- The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water, and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable. 
FAMILY MOM (CONT'D) 
(VERY TENSE) Janey, Kyle, Holland. Out of the water. We're going to find a new spot. 
JANEY No, Mama. This place has little rocks 
THAT-- 
FAMILY MOM Get out of the damn water! Now! The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off with them down the path. After a moment of awkward silence, Doug looks at the guys. 
DOUG We should go.

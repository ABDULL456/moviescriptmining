The only operating broadcast tower in London; home of the Mouth. 
INT.  RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH 
Lewis Prothero leans forward and lets his voice pour like syrup over the microphone. 
PROTHERO Good morning, London.  This is the voice of Fate -- Damn. 
He stops and coughs. 
PROTHERO Good morning -- ack.  Good morning Lond-- Goddammit!  Where is my bloody tea?! 
In the control booth, Roger Dascombe, his hair thinner now, rubs his temple. 
DASCOMBE Would someone get his lordship his bloody tea? 
He clicks on the microphone. 
DASCOMBE Lewis, they want this report on the first hour -- 
PROTHERO I know.  I know.  Damned inconvenient this entire affair. Fine.  Let's try again. 
He clears his voice and the red "record" light turns on. 
PROTHERO Good morning, London.  It is 6 am, the fifth of November 2019 and this is the voice of Fate.  The new day brings good news and bright prospects from overseas, where negotiations with New China are moving in a positive direction. Last night's scheduled demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch. 
Dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling. 
PROTHERO Spokesman for the Interior ministry said both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the unsuspecting public.  Plans for new landmarks are well underway. 
Prothero sits back, shaking his head. 
PROTHERO Do you believe this crap, Dascombe? 
DASCOMBE It's not our job to believe it, Lewis.  Our job is to tell the people -- 
PROTHERO "Exactly what they tell us."  I Know but do you think that people will believe it? 
DASCOMBE They will if it's you that's telling it to them.  Now let's try it again. 
INT.  SHADOW GALLERY 
V is alone, listening to the first morning broadcast. 
PROTHERO (V.O.) ... plans for new landmarks are already well underway. 
He clicks off the radio.  Walking down a hall, he stops and peers into Evey's new bedroom. 
She is fast asleep, looking remarkably at peace.  Quietly, he shuts the door. 
EXT.  TRAIN STATION 
People are hurrying to board a departing train. 
INT.  TRAIN CAR 
Prothero is staring out his window. 
PROTHERO "Remember, remember, the fifth of November..." 
He talks to his bodyguards almost as if talking to himself. 
PROTHERO Do you suppose that's why he did it? 
BODYGUARD 1 Sir, who did what, sir? 
PROTHERO Guy Fawkes.  He tried to blow up Parliament. 
The guards look at each other, confused. 
PROTHERO Don't they teach history in school anymore? 
BODYGUARD 1 Sir, we're both straight military, sir. 
BODYGUARD 2 Sir, yes, sir.  I was fighting in Ireland by the time I was sixteen. 
PROTHERO Yes, of course.  My mistake. 
He turns back to his window. 
EXT.  RAILROAD 
The train rumbles along, heading for a tunnel. 
INT.  TRAIN CAR 
Prothero watches the countryside rolling past. 
PROTHERO I love trains.  I remember riding the underground with my father. Shame they shut them all down. 
Bodyguard 1 looks out the opposite window just as the train enters the tunnel. 
BODYGUARD 1 What the hell's that! 
EXT.  TRAIN 
For a flashing instant, we see V in silhouette, cloak swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the bridge onto the train. 
INT.  TRAIN CAR 
Prothero and Bodyguard 2 stare at Bodyguard 1. 
BODYGUARD 1 I thought I saw a man jumping onto the train. 
BODYGUARD 2 The train's doing almost seventy. It would break his legs. 
BODYGUARD 1 You're right, I... It must have been rags. 
EXT.  TRAIN 
Deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.

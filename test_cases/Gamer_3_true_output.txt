GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING.       The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open - 
HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN. 
HACKMAN (friendly) Hi, Kable. 
BOOM. 
KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR. 
HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES. 
125   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                               125 
KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK, SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE. 
TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE has obviously interrupted something. 
126   INT. ELEVATOR - SIMULTANEOUS                                       126 
HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still smoking - shoulder strapped. 
HACKMAN (to ANGIE) Anybody in there? 
The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING, NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE. 
HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious. 
GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes: 
GORGE/ANGIE Come on... do it... 
HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one... but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.

WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007 126   CONTINUED:                                                        126 
The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE. HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK. 
ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY. 
HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS... 
KABLE is waiting. 
127   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                         127 
KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts with BLOOD. 
HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches; displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall behind him, four inches deep. 
HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away, HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out a set of HACKMAN'S toes. 
KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up his own WEAPON to close the deal... 
... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE. 
MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN. 
KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and breaks for the BACK EXIT. 
128   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                                128 
KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM. 
KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at GORGE: 
KABLE YOU!   WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO? 
CONTINUOUS SHOT: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across the street, leading the way;

KABLE takes out another BLUE at a distance, following close behind her. They run into a GENERIC, UNMARKED BUILDING... 
129   INT. SOCIETY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                                129 
... the SHOT CONTINUES, across the LOBBY, through an anonymous grey door... 
130   INT. STAIRS/PINK CORRIDOR                                         130 
...and down a FLIGHT OF STAIRS... MUFFLED MUSIC is THUMPING, getting LOUDER... down a PINK CORRIDOR and into... 
131   INT. UNDERGROUND RAVE - CONTINUOUS                                131 
... a 24 HOUR UNDERGROUND RAVE, in full effect.

73    INT. LIVING ROOM. BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                73 
Rachel runs the hem of a partially-made WHITE GARMENT through a SEWING MACHINE. She finishes and takes it over to where Stephan stands waiting. It's unfinished, but a fairly good approximation of a MEDIC'S WHITE COAT. 
RACHEL Try this on. 
Stephan puts it on. She tugs at the coat, straightens the unfinished collar, runs her hands down the front to smooth it out. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) (re: the coat) How does it feel? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   31. 
STEPHAN (Flirting) Nice. 
Rachel ignores this, begins to pin the cuff of one of the sleeves. 
STEPHAN (CONT'D) Here you are, Mossad agent, all those years of training, the highest levels of marksmanship and krav magah, first big mission...sewing. 
Rachel resists a smile, brandishes the pin. 
RACHEL Black belt in dressmaking. 
He holds up his hands in surrender. STEPHAN I never argue with an armed woman. 
74    INT. KITCHEN. SAFEHOUSE - LATER                              74 
Rachel and Stephan sit as David serves the dinner. Rachel examines her dish. 
RACHEL (Politely) What is it? 
DAVID (Beat) It doesn't have a name. 
Stephan tastes his. 
STEPHAN (Grimacing) Shit. 
David lifts his spoon, blows on it. 
DAVID (Solemn) Now it does. 
They laugh a little, settle into eating. 
David stares at his bowl, deciding whether or not to say something. Finally... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   32. 
DAVID (CONT'D) It's my birthday. 
They look up at him in surprise. 
75    INT. BAR - LATER                                             75 
Tinny music plays. 
The place is almost empty. In the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer - just young people, laughing, a little drunk. They could be students. 
Rachel is reciting something from memory. 
RACHEL Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... STEPHAN We're too late for all of those. 
They laugh. 
RACHEL Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals." 
STEPHAN (Flirtatious) What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs. 
RACHEL I don't know. I'm waiting to find out. 
STEPHAN (smiles to himself) Youth... 
RACHEL What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal? 
STEPHAN (Smiling) Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   33. 
RACHEL So what's your goal? 
STEPHAN Director of Collections by forty. 
They laugh. 
RACHEL (To David) What about you David. What "life goal" are you pursuing? 
David smiles, stares at his drink. 
DAVID This is it. 
Rachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings. RACHEL This is it? This is all you want? 
David laughs. He would obviously rather change the subject but Rachel is a little drunk, a little curious. 
RACHEL Seriously, what do you want out of life? 
DAVID (Beat, shrugs) I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth. 
He looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere.

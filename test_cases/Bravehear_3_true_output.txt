Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates. 
ROYAL MAGISTRATE William Wallace! You stand in taint of high treason. 
We PUSH IN on the iron mask that binds his face. We can only see his eyes -- but they are bright. 
WALLACE Treason. Against whom? 
MAGISTRATE Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say? 
WALLACE Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king -- 
MAGISTRATE It matters not, he is thy king! 
WALLACE -- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject! 
MAGISTRATE Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?! 
WALLACE I do not confess. 
MAGISTRATE Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe. 
EXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER 
The stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to this day as the Wallace Tower. 
INT. PRISON - NIGHT 
Wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints. 
We can only see his eyes, as he prays. 
WALLACE I am so afraid... Give me strength. 
OUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR 
The jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters. 
JAILER Your Highness! 
PRINCESS I will see the prisoner. 
JAILER We've orders from the king -- 
PRINCESS The king will be dead in a month! And his son is a weakling! Who do you think will rule this kingdom? Now OPEN THIS DOOR! 
The jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright. 
JAILER On your feet, you filth! 
PRINCESS Stop! Leave me! (they hesitate) There is no way out of this hell! Leave me with him! 
Reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries to distract her. 
WALLACE M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger. 
PRINCESS Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. 
WALLACE Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves? 
PRINCESS Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live. 
WALLACE If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. 
She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the tears. And the jailers are watching. 
WALLACE Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger. 
She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading... 
PRINCESS You will die! It will be awful! 
WALLACE Every man dies. Not every man really lives. 
She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers... 
PRINCESS Drink this! It will dull your pain. 
WALLACE It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.

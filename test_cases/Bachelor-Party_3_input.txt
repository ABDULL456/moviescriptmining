There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist. 
He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters. 
RICK What the hell are you doing? 
LARRY I'm trying to slash my wrists. 
RICK You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? 
LARRY I couldn't find any razor blades. 
RICK Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. 
LARRY (suddenly laughs like a crazy man) Ha, ha, ha. 
RICK No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party. 
As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life. 
RICK Gary, how we doing, big stallion? 
GARY Rick, I really think I'm in love. 
RICK This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on. 
Rick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror. 
GARY (into mirror) This time it's real. She's wonderful. 
Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his dress and turns to Gary. 
SHE The name's Tim. I'm always available. 
He blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back. 
SHE/TIM By the way... I also do engine work on BMW's. 'Bye. 
Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat. 
EXT. STABLES - NIGHT 
Ryko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they see. 
RYKO All right. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Standing there is a donkey, eating straw. 
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Cole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out, then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on. He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and enters the other hotel. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
The party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick. 
O'NEILL Rick, I'm concerned. 
RICK About what? 
O'NEILL This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. 
RICK (trying to joke his way out of it) Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. 
O'NEILL I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. 
RICK Oooooo. 
O'NEILL (indicating the bedroom) Right in there, pal. 
RICK If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. 
O'NEILL That's the old Rick! 
Rick enters the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM 
It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman. 
RICK Hellooo! 
Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions later. 
RICK (to himself; overwhelmed by her) Eat my chair!

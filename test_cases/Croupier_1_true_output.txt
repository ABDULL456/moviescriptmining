He passes a poster for the National Lottery bearing the legend: 'IT COULD BE YOU'. JACK doesn't see it. 
INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A WOMAN smashes a plate over a MAN'S head. It's plate- smashing party time, Greek-style. TWENTY drunk PEOPLE having fun. Zorba music. Plates are thrown, stamped on, smashed. 
JACK sits alone at a corner table, drinking, watching the fun, unsmiling. One plate cracks into a wall behind him. A MAN stumbles backwards into JACK's table. JACK swiftly moves his drink out of the way. The MAN apologises, turns to JACK. It is MATT. 
MATT Jacko! How're you doing? (shakes Jack's hand vigorously) I heard about the raid. Pity they didn't pull it off. I wish I'd been there. 
MATT has to shout above the noise and music. JACK smiles. 
JACK (quietly) But you were there Matt. 
MATT doesn't hear. 
MATT What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her. 
JACK I'd like to buy you a drink. 
MATT Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight. (suddenly) Hey, you haven't changed your clothes! 
INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
There are four or five PEOPLE left among the debris. MATT has gone. 
JACK is still there, drunk now. 
JACK'S VOICE The music stopped, Jack was drunk... hallucinating. He was back, as a child, in the Wild Coast Casino. 
A BLACK WOMAN comes over to him. Her name is LUCY. 
LUCY You've been avoiding me. 
JACK (blearily) Have I? 
LUCY I'm Lucy. 
JACK And what do you do, Lucy? 
LUCY I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on? 
JACK Are you going to put a spell on me? 
LUCY I might. 
EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - DAWN 
LUCY guides JACK to a parked car. He is drunker than she. When he sees the car he starts to laugh. It is his Austin Healey. 
JACK Nice car. How much did you pay for it? 
LUCY Too much. Eighteen hundred. 
She opens the door for him. They climb in. LUCY starts the car. 
LUCY Where to? 
JACK Turn left at the lights. 
They drive off. 
EXT. STREET - DAWN 
A deserted intersection. The Austin Healey swings around a corner.  A WOMAN steps out from the kerb. 
INT. CAR - DAWN 
JACK reacts. He swings the wheel. LUCY shouts. The car swerves, missing the WOMAN. 
LUCY Hey! I saw her! 
JACK looks back. The WOMAN is shouting after the car.

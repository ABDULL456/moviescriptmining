CJ (quietly) Kill me. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Kumail wears a SHALWAR KURTA. 
KUMAIL Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas. Except instead of the traditional Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which my khansama Chris will serve to you right now. Khansama is Urdu for servant. 
Chris hands out WHITE SUGARY CHALKY CUBES from a tray. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) If you'd like to make it at home, the main ingredients are condensed milk, sugar, and love. At least, that was my mom's recipe. 
CJ (quietly, to Chris) Hey, you look like a children's toy from Malaysia. 
KUMAIL Now all rise for the Pakistani national anthem. 
All stand with their hand over their hearts as Kumail sings. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 
Emily meets Kumail backstage.        She wears a SWEATSHIRT with BRAINS on it. 
EMILY Hey! 
KUMAIL Hey!    So? What did you think? 
EMILY Um, I thought it was great. 
KUMAIL Yeah? 
EMILY I never knew that Pakistan had the world's largest irrigation system. 
KUMAIL Yeah. Something like 14 million hectares are being irrigated. As soon as I read that I was like "oh, that's going in the show." 
CJ and Mary appear behind them. 
CJ Hey, that was... You were in the zone, man. That was the best one we've seen. 
MARY Yeah, that was so honest and good. 
CJ And you know what I realized halfway through? You're from Pakistan! Good to see you Emily! 
EMILY Bye guys! 
CJ Keep up the- 
They exit. 
KUMAIL They seem to like it. 
EMILY They're so nice. 
KUMAIL So, really what did you think?   You know, it's a work in progress... 
EMILY I really liked it. I learned a lot. About Pakistan, and cricket. All those positions. But I just wish that I learned more about you. Does that make any sense? 
KUMAIL Yeah. 
INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Kumail is asleep. EMILY is awake. She looks over at Kumail, and very silently, guiltily, crawls out of bed. 
INT. KUMAIL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Emily sneaks past Chris who is passed out on the couch and goes into the bathroom. 
INT. KUMAIL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Emily looks around Kumail's bedroom for something. 
She starts putting her clothes on. Kumail wakes up. 
KUMAIL Hey. 
EMILY Oh, hi! 
KUMAIL It's 3 AM. 
EMILY Is that diner around the corner open?

Sean nods, hurrying off as others start to crowd around. Miss Van Deusen looks up at them. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine -- everybody go back to what you were doing. 
They disperse. Rennie slowly starts to cry, holding tight to her teacher. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Care to talk about it? 
After a moment to compose herself... 
RENNIE I can't swim. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I gathered that. 
Rennie says nothing else. Miss Van Deusen knows she's holding out. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. (beat) I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since. 
RENNIE It's not that simple. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you? 
RENNIE (long pause) Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him. 
The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful pause. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN When did this start? 
RENNIE About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN After your parents passed away? 
Rennie nods somberly. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Did you have an accident in the lake? 
RENNIE No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees. 
The name has triggered some deep memory...but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncle's voice. 
MCCULLOCH (O.S.) Dear God... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked. He's livid. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... 
MCCULLOCH Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen. 
RENNIE It wasn't her fault. 
He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean. 
MCCULLOCH Stay away from her...both of you. 
He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks their path, slipping his flask away. 
DECK HAND He's come back and you're all going to die. 
Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch. 
RENNIE Just...leave me alone... 
She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
as a loud, firm KNOCK punctuates the silence. Then comes a sultry voice... 
TAMARA (O.S.) The door's open. 
McCulloch swings it open. 
MCCULLOCH I'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe. 
TAMARA Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles? 
He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer. 
MCCULLOCH Where did you get that alcohol? 
TAMARA I packed it. Just for us. 
EXT. DECK CORRIDOR - STALKING POINT OF VIEW 
as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the people. 
INT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS

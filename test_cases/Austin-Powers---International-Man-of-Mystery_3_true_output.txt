VANESSA I am not. 
AUSTIN Oh, yes you are. 
VANESSA I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm always the designated driver. 
They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at her.  There is an awkward silence. 
She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away. 
AUSTIN I can't.  You're drunk. 
VANESSA It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. (pause) What was my mother like back in the Sixties?  I'm dying to know. 
AUSTIN (sentimental) She was very groovy.  She was so in love with your Dad.  If there was one 
other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed. 
Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep. A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a 
RED LIGHT FLASHES. 
Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (on the picture phone) Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately. 
AUSTIN Right away, Exposition. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Where is Vanessa, by the way? 
Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure. 
AUSTIN She's working on another lead right now. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck. 
AUSTIN Thank you, Basil. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Oh, and Austin&emdash 
AUSTIN (knowing) Yes? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. 
AUSTIN Oh, yes.  Thank you. 
BASIL EXPOSITION There's one more thing, Austin. 
AUSTIN Yes? 
BASIL EXPOSITION Be careful. 
AUSTIN Thank you. 
Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card. 
INT.  ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE 
Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.  Austin passes a piece of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy. 
AUSTIN Paging Dr. Freud. 
He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase.  He opens it. 
FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT 
Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature camera/pendant. 
AUSTIN (photographing) Give it to me baby.  Super. 
We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's holdings in a flow-chart fashion. 
AUSTIN Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes! Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

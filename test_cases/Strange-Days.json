{"test1_input": "Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle. Good morning. \nThe TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured black man. \nANCHORWOMAN ... bodies of two men found early this morning under the Hollywood freeway have been identified as rap star Jeriko One and bandmember James Polton, known to fans as \"Replay\". A third body, that of a woman, has not yet been identified.  With his band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko One's outspoken political stance and violent lyrics have stirred nationwide controversy... \nCUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one. \nCUT TO: \nLenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day. \nLENNY (on cellular) You know I can get you anything you want, anytime you want it, just not right now.  We'll hook up at the club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah. \nLenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of the Coral Lounge. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORAL LOUNGE \nThe decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office. It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure cooker. \nLenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He leans on the bar. \nBARTENDER Hey, Lenny. \nLENNY Anything without an umbrella. \nHe gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket: Fabrizio. \nFABRIZIO Lenny my man, I think you want to meet a friend of mine. \nLenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power- casual, sitting at a booth across the room. \nLENNY Looks like money to me. \nLenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio across the room. \nFABRIZIO Don't forget your friends. \nLENNY 10 percent, Fabri, like always. \nThey slide into the booth with KEITH. \nFABRI Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was telling you about.  He can get you anything you-- \nLENNY (cutting him off) Just a second.  Not to be rude, Keith, but I got to ask, are you a cop? \nKEITH I understand.  No, I'm not. \nLENNY You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right? \nKEITH That's right. \nLenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the table. \nLENNY Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law, would be my guess. (off the guy's scowl) Relax.  I just like to guess, is all.  It's my job to know people and what they want... what's behind their eyes. \nFABRIZIO Lenny gives people their heart's desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny? \nLENNY That's right.  My second question I gotta ask, so we get our bearings here... have you ever jacket in? Have you ever wiretripped? \nKEITH No. \nLENNY (a winning grin) A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time... \nKEITH (shrugs) Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you? \nLENNY I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software. \nKEITH Clips. \nLENNY That's right.  Clips. (Lenny leans in, working the guy) Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it. \nKEITH What kind of things exactly? \nLENNY Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be. (handing Fabrizio a twenty) Fabri, get us another round, would you. \nFabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar. \nLENNY You want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can.  But I'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's not what you're interested in here. It's about the stuff you can't have... right?  The forbidden fruit. \nKeith nods, mesmerized by Lenny. \nLENNY Like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins.  Or... (pointing discreetly) ... see that guy, with the drop-dead Philipino girl friend? (Keith looks) Wouldn't you like to be that guy for twenty minutes?  The right twenty minutes.  I can make it happen.  And you won't even tarnish your wedding ring. \nKeith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins. \nKEITH (hooked like a carp) Sounds good. \n", "test1_true": "KEITH (flushed, sweating, ready) Talk to me about costs, here. \nLENNY Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me. \nKEITH What?  Right Here? \nLENNY (grinning) Step into my office. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORAL LOUNGE/MEN'S ROOM \nClose on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter reacting to a Squid tape.  He jerks... his mouth drops open... he gasps.  His hands start to move over his body, feeling it wonderingly.  He gasps again, tilts his head down, moans... and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback. Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny. \nLENNY You were just an eighteen year old girl taking a shower.  Are you beginning to see the possibilities here? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE \nA figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit. She tries the door of the car: locked.  She looks toward the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny. Better not. \nShe takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a note on the label: \"HELP ME.  IRIS.\" She drops the tape through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces off the seat, onto the floor. \nShe looks through the windshield, totally distraught, trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street. She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out. And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground, crying, afraid to move. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORAL LOUNGE \nA man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame.  A daunting figure as he approaches the bartender. \nMAN (MAX) Where is he? \nBobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR/CORAL LOUNGE \nLenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy corridor with her new customer, Keith. \nKEITH Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public? \nLENNY (grinning) You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me-- \nBehind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and SLAMS him face-first into the wall, jamming a .45 against his skull. \nMAN (MAX) Don't move!  That's it, assume the position you miserable techno-perv puke. \nCop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet apart.  Starts to cuff him. \nMAN (to Keith) Beat it fuckwad. \nAsh-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall.  On the main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and hurries after him. \nBack in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his attacker against the opposite wall.  The guy offers no resistance.  In fact, he's too weak from laughing. \nMAN (MAX) Gotcha. \nLENNY Damnit, Max, I was with a client! You think that's funny?  To mess with a man's livelihood?  It's not funny! \nMAX You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders. \nLENNY (laughing a little) Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money. \nMAX Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink. \nLENNY Least you can do. \nMax Peltier, which he mispronounces \"Pelcher\", slings his arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder.  They cross to the bar.  Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing between strangers like an out of control tractor. \nREGULAR Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max! \nMAX Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might kill every man in here.  But first I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink. (seeing another regular) Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your wife does give good head. \nMax lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop. \nMAX Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie. \nLENNY Thanks, Max. \nMAX D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp? \nLENNY This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe. \nMAX That's not sayin' much. \n", "test1_id": 1815, "test2_input": "LENNY I thought we were friends. \nMACE No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here. \nLENNY So am I.  Just trying to get by. \nMACE No, you're just trying to get off. \nLENNY Macey... I've never seen you like this. \nMACE Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer. \nLENNY I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really. \nMACE Look, I gotta get some sleep. \nLENNY You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies? \nShe hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm. \nMACE (a tiny smile) Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it. \nLENNY Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way. \nMACE Jesus, Lenny. \nLENNY Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her. \nMACE Sure, Lenny. (she puts the car in gear) The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT \nAs Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens the door. \nLENNY Come on, let me buy you a drink. Let's drink and make up. (Mace shakes her head) Alright, I'm going to see Faith. That means you can watch me suffer. I'll be in agony, you'll feel so much better.  Total and thorough payback, whatdya say? \nMace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH \nMace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge. \nThere are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs. \nThe Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain). \nLenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. \nThrough the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind. SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. \nIt is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. \nThe woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot. \nTran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. \n... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second. \nTran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet- thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four. \nLENNY Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse? \nMACE Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and \nLENNY Rams... that's football, right? \nHe can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar. \nMACE Forget her. \nLENNY She still loves me. \nMACE She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this. \nLENNY She's my destiny. \nMACE Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. \nLENNY You'll see. \nMace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny virtually ignores them. \nApproaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him; no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense. \nTran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they stay casual. \n", "test2_true": "TRAN You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays? \nLENNY You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls. \nTRAN (glancing at Faith, back at Lenny) I already got everything I need from you. \nFAITH Cut it out, Tran. \nLENNY Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break. \nTRAN Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist. \nLENNY Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out. \nTRAN I always do. \nLENNY Faith, can I talk to you a second? \nFAITH I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny. \nLENNY I just got to talk to you for one second. \nTRAN About what? \nLENNY That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it? \nTran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly in the general area between his table and Lenny. \nTRAN I don't feel anything between you. See, your trouble is you assume too much, Lenny.  You assume there's something where there's nothing. You assume you have a life.  But you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own. \nFaith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny. \nFAITH (icy) We have nothing to talk about, Lenny. \nTRAN Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car. \nJoey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall. \nLENNY Faith, call me, okay? \nFAITH No, Lenny. \nWade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering. As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him coming the other way. \nLENNY Tick, listen, I can't stop right now.  but I'll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about. \nHe's working the room even as he's getting dragged outside. \nTRAN Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams. \nFAITH Leave him alone, Tran. \nTRAN He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now. \nFAITH You're too goddamned paranoid. \nTRAN Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RETINAL FETISH \nBeemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside. \nA SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the entering crowd. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH \nLenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor. Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks on, crosses to a door, and enters... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH \nA tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana, whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five Lenny as he walks in. \nLENNY So, those rascals still haven't grown back yet, huh? \nTEX (peering under the blanket on his lap) Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now, though. \nLENNY (handing Tex a Squid) Present.  Something I had made.  Let me know what you think. \nTEX Hey, alright.  Got something here for you, too. (passes him an envelope) It just showed up tonight, don't know who left it. \nLENNY Fan mail from some flounder? \n", "test2_id": 1816, "test3_input": "INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT \nSquid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room, passing the mirror on the dresser. \nLENNY (V.O.) Come on... look in the mirror.  You know it's there, you're keeping your eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT! Who are you? \nCUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near him. \nLENNY He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot. \nMACE So that gives you something. \nLENNY It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear. \nAs he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he is using to boost the gain. \nMACE Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself. \nLENNY I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong... \nMace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on and hits playback. \nSquid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death, separated by burst of static... \n... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons, searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on the tape, trying to manage his revulsion... \n... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts, afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is alive with them, shimmering. \nMACE No more, Lenny. \nLENNY Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad. \nLenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly. \nLENNY She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night. \nMACE It's not your fault. \nLenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with him. \nLENNY Sex killers act alone.  So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made.  Cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene. \nLenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a bottle of vodka. \nLENNY And anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker.  They're roadkill. \nRequiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes, waiting for the Tylenols to hit. \nLENNY See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve. \nMACE But that doesn't add, does it. \nLENNY No it doesn't. \nMACE Because Iris knew somebody was after her. \nLenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing. \nLENNY She said \"If they get me\".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason. \nMACE So the guy's not a sicko. \nLENNY If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko. \nMACE Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear? \nLENNY Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone. (he seems to run out of energy) But then why give the rape to me? \nMACE That's where it gets a little strange. \nLENNY And what about the guy that was following me? \nMACE Now you're really getting paranoid. \nLenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples. \nLENNY The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck? \nMACE Sure. \nMace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little. \nLENNY How's Zander? \nMACE OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him. \nLenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap. \nMACE I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry. \n", "test3_true": "She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He is out cold. \nMace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving. \nAnd we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but there it is. \nShe shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now. Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty top of the couch, sighs.  And keeps her hand moving soothingly on his head. \nCUT TO: \nEXT./ INT.  MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY \nMace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco house in Inglewood.  It's dawn.  A neighbor is walking the dog.  Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of toys left scattered in the front yard. \nInside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns at her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch. \nZANDER Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy? \nMACE Just Lenny. \nZANDER Right.  That explains it. \nMACE Are you going to make me beg? \nZander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around her.  Big hug. \nMACE (looking at weird stuff in cereal) What is that? \nZANDER Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good. \nMACE Well give me some then... I'm starving. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT \n2:20  P.M.  DEC 31 \nLenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing.  He is on the couch, still clothed.  He hears Max's voice on the answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver. \nMAX (V.O.) Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed. \nLENNY W'sup, Max? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY \nMax, on the cellular, across the street from a church where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One. The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control cops. \nMAX Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've just been saying words over Jeriko. Tensions running pretty high down here.  I'm telling you. \nWHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes out of the church with Faith next to him.  Corto, Vita, Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around them as the press bears down, shouting out questions. Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after her.  The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the car as it pulls away. \nCUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny. \nLENNY (V.O.) Faith OK? \nMAX Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash. \nLENNY Looks like she was holding out. \nMAX Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move. \nLENNY (V.O.) He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith. \nMAX I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT \nAs Lenny is hanging up he notices something.  A MANILA ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his front window, next to the door.  \"NERO\" is printed on the envelope. \nOh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He stares at it with dread. \nLenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and punches PLAY. \nPOV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally- like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door... the back door to Lenny's apartment. \nThe killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room. \nMoving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively looking around the door frame to the living room.  There is Lenny, crashed out on the couch. \nNow moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends the blade... click, click, click, click. \nThe blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat. Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark. \n", "test3_id": 1817}

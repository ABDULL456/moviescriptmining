{"train": "S T R A N G E   D A Y S \nby James Cameron & Jay Cocks \nfrom a story by James Cameron \nAUGUST 11, 1993 \n1:06 AM DEC 30, 1999 \nBlackness.  We hear: \nVOICE Ready? \nSECOND VOICE (LENNY) Yeah.  Boot it. \nA burst of bright white static exploding across the darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to street sounds and rapid breathing. \nAN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front seat. \nOur POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in \"our\" hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into a coat pocket. \nOUR VOICE Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording. \nThe guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask. He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off. \nLANE Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for waitin' till I get this fuckin thing on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or what? \nHe tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it. Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up over our field of view. \nWe realize: this is not some ride-along verite video. \nWE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is human experience. \nThe driver is a Hispanic guy named \"SPAZ\" DIAZ.  Lane is a white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald with primer. \nLANE Next alley... just pull in slow. (turning to us) Hurry up will ya.  Here. \nHe hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the rounds, snap it closed. \nDiaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside. \nLANE Let's go. \nOut of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now. Through the door, after Lane, moving fast. \nInto the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning, surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: \"quiet\" in any language. \nOur hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the front room. \nWe hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through. \nWhip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we put the gun on them. \nOUR VOICE (shouting, edgy) Don't move, don't talk, don't do nothing. \nOur POV is whipping around, from the front door to the owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he steps back from the cash-register. \nWe scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred bucks in tens and fives. \nNow yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up. \nInto the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking them in. \nLane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him. We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one way, then the other. \nShit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the car. \nDoor not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning rubber as he launches back down the alley. SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then-- KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out into the street. \nThe cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street. He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better. \nThe cop car surges onto the street behind us. \nLooking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the cars, into the intersection. \nA near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating. Another red light ahead. \nLANE Don't stop! \nTruck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ cuts the wheel but too late... \nClipping the truck and spinning. The street outside smearing past like the view from a Tilt-a-whirl. \nThen KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and launching up and over, and-- \nKRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass. \nIt gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves. Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down. \nShe continues her run, moving away from the direction of the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying, she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of sight. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT \nIris sprints down an alley between buildings.  Rats scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and the sound of the helicopter droning, circling. \nShe pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well- lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low- life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station. \nShe walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign, feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding. She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely glance at her. \nLOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes and boots of winter. \nSHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block, behind her. \nIN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street. They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties, and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a ferret. \nENGELMAN She's a hooker, vice'll have her in the book.  We can pick her up later. \nSPREG No.  Now. \nIRIS knows the cops are behind her.  She is terrified to turn.  Finally she can't stand it any more.  She breaks into a run.  The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring after her. \nIris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to her and the cops jump out. \nIris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full- tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose groceries go flying. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN \nIris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a hurdler. \nThe cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness... a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey. \nStreet people fall back as Spreg thunders through them. They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop and his boy wonder. \nThe two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight. \nMOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains, eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) Do you request back-up? \nSPREG Negative.  Suspect is a black male, age 35 to 40.  We're handling it. \nA train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops' footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close. \nSuddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes, thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman straight-arms his pistol. \nENGELMAN FREEZE! \nIris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She gasps for breath and looks up to see... \n... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun through the window. \nThinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and presses herself up against the solid wall next to the door, where he can't see her. \nOUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train. He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt. \nIris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag her right out through the window. \nShe struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the window, screaming. \nThen... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head. \nSpreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol and fires at Iris. \nShe jerks back through the window and drops to the floor. A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over. \nSPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the cap. \nCLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET. \nIris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes going crazy wide. \nENGELMAN Oh shit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT./ INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIT'S 4 AM.  Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate into the center court of his ratty building.  The pool furniture is in the pool.  Gang graffiti marks the walls. Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the place an eerie, dead glow.  Can out slick Lenny really live in this dump? \nThrough a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the F.G. \nBEEP.  And... \nIRIS (V.O.) Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be there, you got to help me, come on, pick up, pick up... \nSunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle. Good morning. \nThe TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured black man. \nANCHORWOMAN ... bodies of two men found early this morning under the Hollywood freeway have been identified as rap star Jeriko One and bandmember James Polton, known to fans as \"Replay\". A third body, that of a woman, has not yet been identified.  With his band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko One's outspoken political stance and violent lyrics have stirred nationwide controversy... \nCUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one. \nCUT TO: \nLenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day. \nLENNY (on cellular) You know I can get you anything you want, anytime you want it, just not right now.  We'll hook up at the club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah. \nLenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of the Coral Lounge. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORAL LOUNGE \nThe decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office. It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure cooker. \nLenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He leans on the bar. \nBARTENDER Hey, Lenny. \nLENNY Anything without an umbrella. \nHe gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket: Fabrizio. \nFABRIZIO Lenny my man, I think you want to meet a friend of mine. \nLenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power- casual, sitting at a booth across the room. \nLENNY Looks like money to me. \nLenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio across the room. \nFABRIZIO Don't forget your friends. \nLENNY 10 percent, Fabri, like always. \nThey slide into the booth with KEITH. \nFABRI Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was telling you about.  He can get you anything you-- \nLENNY (cutting him off) Just a second.  Not to be rude, Keith, but I got to ask, are you a cop? \nKEITH I understand.  No, I'm not. \nLENNY You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right? \nKEITH That's right. \nLenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the table. \nLENNY Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law, would be my guess. (off the guy's scowl) Relax.  I just like to guess, is all.  It's my job to know people and what they want... what's behind their eyes. \nFABRIZIO Lenny gives people their heart's desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny? \nLENNY That's right.  My second question I gotta ask, so we get our bearings here... have you ever jacket in? Have you ever wiretripped? \nKEITH No. \nLENNY (a winning grin) A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time... \nKEITH (shrugs) Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you? \nLENNY I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software. \nKEITH Clips. \nLENNY That's right.  Clips. (Lenny leans in, working the guy) Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it. \nKEITH What kind of things exactly? \nLENNY Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be. (handing Fabrizio a twenty) Fabri, get us another round, would you. \nFabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar. \nLENNY You want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can.  But I'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's not what you're interested in here. It's about the stuff you can't have... right?  The forbidden fruit. \nKeith nods, mesmerized by Lenny. \nLENNY Like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins.  Or... (pointing discreetly) ... see that guy, with the drop-dead Philipino girl friend? (Keith looks) Wouldn't you like to be that guy for twenty minutes?  The right twenty minutes.  I can make it happen.  And you won't even tarnish your wedding ring. \nKeith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins. \nKEITH (hooked like a carp) Sounds good. \nLENNY It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle. \nMax raises his double shooter. \nMAX To the jungle!  Where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day. \nHe downs it in two fierce gulps. \nLENNY You were lucky, Max. \nMAX Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here! \nBobby pours for Max. \nMAX You seen Faith lately? \nLenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor sagging. \nLENNY Naw.  She won't call me. \nMAX Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre. \nLENNY Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern. \nCUT TO: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and Lenny at the bar. \nMAX I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. (philosophically) Broken hearts are for assholes. \nLENNY (seeing Iris) Hey, Iris, you okay? \nIRIS Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's serious... \nMAX (looking at her face) What happened, honey, some john get rough on you? \nIRIS (to Lenny) I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in trouble, and so is Faith. \nMAX (as Lenny reacts to the name) There it is, the magic fuckin' word. \nLenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the bar. \nIRIS Can we go to your car?  There's something you have to see right away. \nHe nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral Lounge. \nLENNY What's going on? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nLenny and Iris come out the front door. \nIRIS It's a bad situation... if they get me I know they're going to -- OH SHIT! \nShe bridles like a startled horse.  Lenny looks at what she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.  Must be the cops.  He turns back... \nShe's gone.  What the hell? \nHe looks back at the red light... and edges around the corner to see what the cops are up to... \nIt's not a cop car.  It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on the hook.  Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a biker only meaner. \nLENNY Hang on, that's my car-- \nTOW DRIVER Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank. \nLENNY Hey wait a second... \nIgnoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift, and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm. The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in Lenny's face. \nLENNY Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two million years of human evolution and that's the best idea you can come up with? (driver continues with the hoist) Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll pay you three fifty, right now.  All you gotta do is drop it off the hook and say you came by, your mark wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh? \nDRIVER You got the cash on you? \nLENNY I was going to write you a check, if that's-- \nThe guy is getting into his truck. \nLENNY Okay, okay, I totally respect that call.  I would want cash.  They'll take my check inside... I can see you're pressed for time, just give me two minutes... here keep my watch for collateral. \nHe hands the guy his watch. \nLENNY It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two minutes. \nLenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.  Lenny runs after his car, yelling, watching it recede. \nLENNY Son of a bitch! \nLenny walks back to the bar.  He sets his Haliburton up on the truck of a car and pops it open.  He takes out a tiny digital cellular phone and dials a number.  While it's ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of the briefcase and slips it on. \nLENNY (an arm around her like a buddy) Mace!  You're a life-saver. \nMACE (resigned) Driving Mr. Lenny. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LIMO - NIGHT \nAs Lenny and Mace cruise the night streets, passing the ongoing pageant of cops and decay.  Mace glances at Lenny, sitting next to her in front, and at his omnipresent Haliburton. \nMACE So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads? \nLENNY No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it. \nMACE Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs. \nLENNY Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives. \nMACE Uh huh, I wanna hear this part. \nLENNY Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something-- \nMACE Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig. \nLENNY Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks. \nMACE Lenny, this shit's illegal. \nLENNY Define illegal. \nMACE Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months. \nLENNY (kidding) Yeah, but that was for love. \nMACE Define love. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ST. JAMES CLUB - NIGHT \nMace's limo wheels up to the hotel on the strip. \nA soberly-dressed Japanese executive is waiting next to the doorman. \nINSIDE the car, Mace spots him and scowls. \nMACE Dammit, Lenny, you made me late. \nLenny opening the door before the car stops. \nLENNY What's his name? \nMACE Fumitsu. \nLENNY Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind. \nFumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for him.  Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front passenger door. \nMACE Um, excuse me. (can't stand to say it) Sir.  Excuse me.  Mr. Nero. \nShe walks calmly to him. \nMACE (hissing through her teeth) What the fuck are you doing? \nLENNY (winning smile, innocent) Coming with you. \nMACE You will not live to see the morning. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT \nAs the limo stops at an elegant home in this top-bucks, old-line residential area.  There is a loud party in progress, with a couple of hundred guests spread through the house and backyard.  Mace scowls deeply as Lenny gets out of the car and starts into the party with Mr. Fumitsu. They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old friends. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT \nMace, having a cigarette with other security drivers, watches Lenny through the tall windows of the old Spanish house.  She sees him working the room, rubbing up against the money, networking.  No dialogue.  A pantomime of Lenny working his prime turf.  She stares at him for a while, then looks at her watch.  Sighs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT./ INT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE/GARDEN - NIGHT \n... as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's path, a top cop named PALMER STRICKLAND. \nSTRICKLAND Nero. \nLENNY (uh-oh) Strickland. \nLenny slumps in the back seat. \nMACE You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all. \nLENNY I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain. \nMACE What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic. \nLENNY It is my sword and my shield, Macey. \nLenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket.  He looks a it, puzzled. \nMACE What's that?  Present from Faith? \nLENNY No idea. \nHe opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY. \nPOV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear, almost hyper-real. \nWE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel. An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time. \nWe come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door. Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty. \nLENNY It's a test pattern so far. \n\"Our\" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very professionally picked. \nLENNY Alright, a little B&E action. \nWe enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON. \nThe Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask. \nThe Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man, dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous. \nLENNY Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense build. \nThe Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door. \nThe Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She turns... \nIt is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties. Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep. Pours the Scotch shakily. \nCUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread. \nIN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside. \nWe stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in the bathroom, washing her face with cold water. \nWe move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes whip back.  Widening in terror. \nShe reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed. We go after her. \nHer hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning-fast. \nWe follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall. \nSlam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor. Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades. \nShe sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor... nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door. \nON LENNY, reacting.  Going white. \nMACE What is it? \nLENNY Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO! \nLenny goes back under the wire, seeing... \nWE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom... propping her up with her back against the white tile wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And crying. \nIRIS (voice distorted) I haven't seen your face... I haven't heard your voice... you can still let me go... \nZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH. \nMoving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack. Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending. What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box. \nLENNY Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to his own output.  She's seeing what he's seeing.  She's seeing herself. \nIris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And she can feel what he feels. \nThe Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now she can only see what the wearer sees. \nAnd also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous clicking sound. \nWe lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T- shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. \nMACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. \nLENNY He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all. \nMACE And gives it to you. \nLENNY Wants to share. \nMAX That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy. \nLENNY Why me? \nMace is hugging herself.  Edgy and tense. \nMACE Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach. \nLENNY I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that. \nMAX He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something. \nMACE Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now? \nLENNY Jesus, Mace.  Back off. \nMACE This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts. \nMAX Problem is, Lenny knows everybody. \nMACE Take the tape to the cops. \nLENNY Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me. \nMACE So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around-- \nMAX Naw, he's right.  They'll figure Lenny's the perp, or go through his client list, ruin his life... such as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys in Homicide... tell them she was a friend of mine and they'll keep me in the loop.  Get me the forensics and all that. (he opens his car door) Get some sleep.  I'll call you when I get something. (he starts his car) And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I were you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ELEVATOR AND TRAN'S LOFT \nThe elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl across his body as the old machinery pulls him up toward... \nFAITH, in the loft above.  She looks into the vast bedroom... \n... at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback trodes, his eyes closed.  She softly closes the sliding door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast to Lenny's ratty digs. \nLENNY'S POV through the cage-door of the elevator as it reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in the shadows.  He slides open the cage-door and she moves quickly to him. \nFAITH (whispering, furtive) You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there. \nLENNY Iris is dead.  She was murdered. \nFaith stiffens.  We see the fear, now, exposed. \nFAITH Who did it? \nLENNY Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too. (he grabs her shoulders) Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it. \nFAITH Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun. \nLENNY (hurt) I have a gun.  It's under my bed. \nFAITH You don't know what you're fucking with here. \nLENNY Tell me. \nA VOICE from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in the air. \nTRAN Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him. \nTran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation. Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and Vita Minh. \nFAITH Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris? \nTRAN A tragic story, no doubt. (to Lenny) How'd you get up here? \nLENNY Charm. \nTRAN (looks at Faith) Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer. (he grabs Faith by the arm, steps closer) Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants. (he turns her loose) Hands off.  See? \nLenny glances at the open elevator right behind him.  So close.  She just has to take one step to him... and they will be out of there.  Together. \nLENNY It's alright.  He means it. \nTRAN (to Faith) I do mean it. (to Lenny) And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand? \nShe glares at them both for a long moment.  Emotions play across her face, complex and unreadable.  She steps back, taking her place at Tran's side. \nFAITH I made my choice, Lenny. \nTRAN (to Lenny, nodding toward the elevator) You're going down. \nINT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT \nSquid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room, passing the mirror on the dresser. \nLENNY (V.O.) Come on... look in the mirror.  You know it's there, you're keeping your eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT! Who are you? \nCUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near him. \nLENNY He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot. \nMACE So that gives you something. \nLENNY It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear. \nAs he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he is using to boost the gain. \nMACE Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself. \nLENNY I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong... \nMace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on and hits playback. \nSquid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death, separated by burst of static... \n... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons, searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on the tape, trying to manage his revulsion... \n... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts, afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is alive with them, shimmering. \nMACE No more, Lenny. \nLENNY Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad. \nLenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly. \nLENNY She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night. \nMACE It's not your fault. \nLenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with him. \nLENNY Sex killers act alone.  So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made.  Cops know they'll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene. \nLenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a bottle of vodka. \nLENNY And anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker.  They're roadkill. \nRequiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes, waiting for the Tylenols to hit. \nLENNY See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve. \nMACE But that doesn't add, does it. \nLENNY No it doesn't. \nMACE Because Iris knew somebody was after her. \nLenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing. \nLENNY She said \"If they get me\".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason. \nMACE So the guy's not a sicko. \nLENNY If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko. \nMACE Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear? \nLENNY Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone. (he seems to run out of energy) But then why give the rape to me? \nMACE That's where it gets a little strange. \nLENNY And what about the guy that was following me? \nMACE Now you're really getting paranoid. \nLenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples. \nLENNY The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck? \nMACE Sure. \nMace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little. \nLENNY How's Zander? \nMACE OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him. \nLenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap. \nMACE I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry. \nThe POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends. \nLENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel anything. \nCrossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under control. \nThen... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click. \nHis eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently toward the kitchen. \nThen he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine. He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round. \nHeart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes intact. \nMace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon jacket over a tank-top. \nMACE Whatup Lenny? \nLENNY (hands shaking) Jesus, Mace! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT \nA little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag: clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do that, she knows things are freaky. \nMACE Where we going? \nLENNY Anywhere. (finger to his lips) We'll talk about it in the car. \nMace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of audio surveillance. \nLENNY Hand me that box of tapes, will you? \nHe's pointing to a shoe box full of \"Faith\" tapes.  Mace hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in the bag, starts to zip it... \n... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror: something's the matter. \nMACE What is it? \nLENNY This tie doesn't go with blue! \nHe yanks off the tie and grabs another. \nCUT TO: \nINT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY \nMace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles. Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending Millennium LA party. \nPOOR MAN ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of the century.  Ten square blocks of madness, with live music, fireworks and the actual rich and famous of LA hobnobbing with us peons.  Also yours truly the Poor Man will be there at the KROQ bandshell, giving away \"Millennium LA\" and \"KROQ 2-K\" T-shirts by the truckload-- \nLenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the back window. \nMACE Will you relax.  There's nobody back there. \nLENNY Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! \nMACE You better keep a low profile for a while. \nLENNY No shit.  You got someplace in mind? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY \nOn Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five. Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of. \nCecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS, and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to \"The Prophets of Rage\" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste. \nZANDER What do you got? \nLENNY (pulls a tape out of his pocket) Today I have... \nMACE (seeing the tape) Lenny, have you lost it completely? \nLENNY Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only. (hands tape to Zander) John Coltrane.  \"A Love Supreme.\" Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful. \nZANDER Let's play it now! \nLENNY Later.  Your mom'n I are heading right back out. \nGroans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even musters the gumption to speak up. \nCECILE Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a full 24 hours, I have to get ready for the party tonight... \nMACE Cecile. \nMace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace. \nENGELMAN Facing us, where we can see it. \nLenny slowly opens the Haliburton.  He takes out the tape and holds it out toward Spreg. \nLENNY Take it and turn her loose.  Okay? \nSPREG Absolutely. \nAnd you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire-- \nWhich is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog. \nLenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover. \nMace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into the car, starting it up. \nSpreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing. He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked nearby, to give chase. \nSpreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even has the door closed. \nCUT TO: \nINT./ EXT.  LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT \nMace has the big car floored.  She looks in the rear-view as the truck gains on them.  Mace is doing her thing... what she's trained for.  Security driving.  She whips some moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them. \nLENNY (holding on) Oh no, we're not being followed, Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny. \nThey hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.  The truck is right behind them. \nLENNY Shit! \nMACE Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant. \nLENNY Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof? \nMACE Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do. \nTHE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a parked van.  Mace accelerates.  The truck stays with them. \nEngelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns. The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the rounds don't come all the way through. \nSpreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light- standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse buildings which front the harbor. \nThe truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange sparks. \nMace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier, stopping before it reaches the end. \nThey are trapped. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT \nEngelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover behind it.  They rake the limo with bursts from their AK- 47s. \nINSIDE THE CAR.  Lenny and Mace keep their heads down below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the armored body panels hold. \nLenny is punching his cellular. \nLENNY Goddamnit!!  911 is busy! \nMACE It's okay, Lenny (he looks at her hopefully) They'd never get here in time anyway. \nMace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from the sideswiping. \nSpreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it. \nHe tosses the flare under the limo... \nKA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are covered in roaring flames. \nMACE (matter-of-fact) This is bad. \nLENNY The gas tank's going to go any second! \nMace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black water. \nInside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car sinks. \nUNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the big streetlights at the end of the pier. \nINSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb. \nLENNY Are you out of your fucking mind?! \nMACE Fire's out, isn't it? \nShe scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge. \nThere are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign automatically as she carries Zander past them. \nONE OF THE BOYS Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl? You never come roun' here no more. \nLenny follows with his wardrobe bag.  The homeboys give Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.  Mace chills them with a glare. \nMACE He's with me. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA small and dingy place.  Cecile has done her best to make it a home. \nMace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door. \nHe quickly sets up his playback deck on the table.  He puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket. Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively... knowing that it contains the answer to all this madness. \nHe puts it into the deck.  The deck closes.  He punches PLAY. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on the balcony of the apartment... visible through the window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the... \nKITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table, trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old cement.  Hands shaking. \nMACE Tell me. \nLENNY I can't tell you.  You've got to see. \nMACE Uh unh.  I won't do it. \nLENNY Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important. \nMace sees how serious he is.  She nods: OK.  He puts the trodes on her. \nLENNY Sorry this has to be your first playback. \nHe hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits her.  She opens her eyes... \nLENNY Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see double. \nShe bites her lip as the sensation of being another person floods through her. \nPOV SEQUENCE: We are Iris.  Riding in a car.  Fixing our makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor.  Iris flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street. It is night. \nWe look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing when we first saw her, two nights ago.  She puts her lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist.  Iris turns her head and we see the driver. \nIt is JERIKO ONE.  He is laughing, talking to someone in the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly. \nIris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash. \nJERIKO Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O \nOur POV swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an LAPD car behind us, with the gumball machine on.  A spotlight hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren.  Jeriko pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder. \nCOP VOICE (on bullhorn) Go to the bottom of the ramp. \nJeriko and Replay are both swearing.  He pulls the car down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously. Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.  We hear the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars. \nWe see the outlines of TWO COPS advancing through the beam of the spotlight, their guns drawn. \nJERIKO (jumping out of the car) Goddamn, now what you pull me over for?  If I was going any slower I'd be parked-- \nCOP VOICE 1 Get down on your knees and put your hands on your head.  Now! \nCOP VOICE 2 Everyone else, out of the car and down on the ground. \nOur POV comes up and out of the car.  Jeriko is righteously pissed off.  He's not following orders. \nCOP VOICE 1 Put your hands behind your head right now! \nHe goes along, madder than ever.  The cops get Replay down on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb. \nThe cops are closer now.  We see that they are SPREG and ENGELMAN. \nENGELMAN (to us) Put your hands on the hood of the car and don't move. \nWe exchange a look with Diamanda.  Fucking cops.  But Jeriko is winding them up.  Not giving them the pleasure of the humiliation.  You can see it escalating. \nJERIKO I suppose you stopped us cause you had suspects fitting our description in the area, what you're gonna tell me.  What was the description?  Two black males in a car?  Yeah, right, I heard that one before... \nAs Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his ID, Jeriko checks name tags. \nJERIKO Well you stopped the wrong black male tonight officer... what is it? Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm the 800 pound gorilla in your mist, fucker.  I make more in a day than you make in a year, and my lawyers love to spend my money dragging sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you into court.  Get a man down on the ground with no probable cause.  Fuck you! \nSPREG Shut the fuck up! \nMACE (steely) Listen to me, little sister. There's something going on, and it's very big.  Now you've got to take care of Zander.  And stay off the streets tonight... you hear me on this? \nCecile gets the message.  She nods. \nMACE Curtis.  What about you?  Do we understand each other?  You stay put. \nCURTIS Yeah.  I'm wit it. \nMace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car. \nCURTIS (to Cecile) Damn!  She worse than you. \nCUT TO: \nINT./ EXT.  CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT \nLenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver the dark streets.  Xenon searchlights crisscross the rooftops nearby.  They see patrol cars passing on cross- streets, lights flashing.  It feels like the entire LAPD is looking for them. \nEverywhere in the street there are small crowds, street parties in progress.  People drinking and firing bottle rockets.  The police watch everything. \nLENNY So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny. \nMACE Well, look at the plus side. \nLENNY There's a plus side? \nMACE Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you. \nLENNY It was a tough call. \nMACE I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops. \nLENNY I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her. \nMACE Why? \nLENNY To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am. \nThey pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security pass and the cop waves them on. \nLenny lets his breath out slowly. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE/TICK'S VAN \nLenny and Mace pull in with a SQUEAL of brakes and park the car.  Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp. \nMace and Lenny get out, approaching the van.  Hearing tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up.  He gets out wearing an ill-fitting rental tux.  Music louder, echoing in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight. \nMAX Sounds like Tick's already celebrating. \nLENNY You may be a little overdressed for this party. (Lenny pounds on the van door) Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up! \nMace slips out her .380, on alert. \nLENNY (knocks again, then opens rear van door) Tick, I got to talk to you, man... oh shit. \nTick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes on his head.  He's breathing, but otherwise he's still. Near lifeless.  A cyborg after a power outage.  All the equipment in the van is trashed. \nLENNY (as he starts to examine Tick) He's been cooked-off \nMAX Is he dead? \nLENNY No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain. \nMace hits \"Off\" on the built-in CD player.  The sudden silence is creepy.  Lenny gets right in front of Tick's eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs. \nTICK'S POV: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static. Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's face, almost invisible.  We hear the tiniest ghost of his voice, like a radio playing two blocks away. \nLENNY He's totally cut off from the outer world. \nMACE How long does it last? (off Lenny's look) Oh. \nMAX Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks. \nMACE This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys. \nMAX There's more to this whole thing than you think. \nLENNY Whattya mean? \nMAX All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff. \nLENNY What stuff? \nMAX Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control. \nLenny takes this in.  All the fight goes out of him.  This is just too overwhelming. \nMax shows up suddenly, right in front of him.  Stopping him. \nMAX Tran, listen.  I was wondering how you want me to work it tonight, down at the Bonaventure.  You want me downstairs at the party or upstairs at the suite?  Where you going to be, mostly? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  TEX'S ROOM \nWhile Max stalls, Faith talks. \nFAITH Tran and Jeriko weren't getting along.  He was afraid Jeriko was getting ready to dump him, but he wasn't sure, so he started with the surveillance.  A couple nights ago he wires up Iris and sends her and the other girl, Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table. \nCUT TO: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's table with Diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay.  Iris stands over Jeriko for just a moment.  Then he nods, smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in the booth right next to him. \nFAITH That night Iris calls up, freaking. She comes over and Tran watches the tape.  He just loses it.  He can't believe the disaster she's gotten him into.  He's terrified the cops will beat it out of her who she was working for, and come looking for him. \nCUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin- lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing. Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's poison. \nLENNY Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch. \nMACE Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way. \nCUT TO: An image of Tran burning the squid tape.  It blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like a venomous snake. \nFAITH The scandal would wipe him out.  If it got out that he had his own artists under surveillance... he'd lose all his other acts.  He'd be over. \nNow we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris.  He wipes at her tear-streaked face.  Hands her a wad of bills. \nFAITH So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do. \nLENNY Yeah... he figured out what to do all right. \nFAITH You think Tran killed her? \nLENNY The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there. \nFAITH What a nightmare. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MAIN FLOOR \nTran impatiently gestures to Corto. \nTRAN Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch. (to Max) We'll talk about this later. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  TEX'S ROOM \nMace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds count. \nMACE Come on.  We're out of here. \nLenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands. \nLENNY Leave here with me, right now. \nMace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling. Faith considers her options.  Then she smiles at him. \nFAITH Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel. \nFaith hugs him, and he clutches her.  Mace locks her jaw and looks away.  This is hard for her. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nMace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell.  They push through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor. Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi- consciousness.  Faith looks back and sees: \nTRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking protesting people out of the way. \nMace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the corridor. \nBehind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.  Vita, Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl. \nTex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms. Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against the floor... \nTEX Teach you... (pound) to mess with... (pound) a helpless cripple! \nLenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and a wall of sound. \nBehind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose through tall grass.  Mace drops back, going tail-end- Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in. \nON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd, Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and... \nTRAN is right in front of him.  In the whirling shapes and colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw. Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again, smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass. \nLenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost in the pounding darkness. \nMAX (V.O.) I intend to. \nLenny punches END.  Mace looks at the number written in blood on the white formica.  Her eyes ratchet up, boring into Lenny.  Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room. \nLENNY Okay, we gotta get over there. (opens the bag) Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something-- \nMACE I'm not going. \nLENNY Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless-- \nMACE Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that. \nLenny nods, hearing what she is saying. \nLENNY That sounds right. (but it changes nothing) I'm going. \nHe reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of \"Faith\" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the suit.  Mace's frustration explodes as anger. \nShe grabs his shoebox full of tapes.  Holds them up to him. \nMACE You gonna get yourself killed for this?  This toxic-waste bitch! \nShe dumps the box of tapes on the floor.  She starts stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into junk. \nLENNY What the fuck are you doing?! \nLenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to stop her, push her away.  They struggle for a pathetic, tragic moment. \nMace snaps.  She grabs him by the lapels and swings him around, slamming him back against a wall. \nMACE Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny! Right here.  Right now.  This is realtime... not playback.  Real... time.  Time to get real.  Understand what I'm saying... she doesn't love you.  Maybe she did once, I don't know, but she doesn't now.  These are used emotions.  It's time to trade them in. \nMace's tone becomes more gentle.  We see that her outburst is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion. \nMACE Lenny, memories were meant to fade. They're designed that way for a reason. \nLenny seems to crumple.  He knows he has to let go.  But it is so painful. \nLENNY Have you ever been in love with somebody who didn't return that love? \nMace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb sometimes. \nMACE Yeah.  Lenny.  I have. \nLENNY It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them... \nMACE I guess. \nLENNY And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it? \nMACE No.  It didn't. \nLenny's eyes are brimming with tears.  He makes no attempt to hide it... doesn't brush them away. \nLENNY I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul. \nMACE You never told me. \nLENNY But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her. (long pause) See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left. \nMACE No, it's not. \nMace takes his face in her hands.  She kisses him lightly on the cheek, where the tear-track is. \nMACE Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a party. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT \n11:07  P.M. \nIT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection video screens are set up all over the place. \nLA is connected to other cities all over the world by satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast. It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia blow-out. \nMadness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It may be the party of the century, but it looks like the middle of a third world revolution. \nMACE That's it.  Let's bail. \nAnd she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit. Snappy. \nMace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between her upper thighs. \nIn fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her braids now loose and full, like a mane. \nLenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is caught by a sudden realization: \nLENNY Mace... you're a girl. \nINT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR \nIt is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is hyperventilating. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOTEL BALLROOM \nMace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air- kissing each other. \nBut as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And Mace follows him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL \nA few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips. \nMace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on, slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland, stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow. \nSTRICKLAND Yes? \nShe puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal. He scowls. \nMACE There's a tape in there you need to see.  I mean right now. \nWhile see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in the mirror at Mace. \nSTRICKLAND If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd arrest you for possession of illegal equipment-- \nMACE (interrupting) Just look at the tape!  You want to know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in the stall right now and hit Play. \nThe young cop steps up behind her. \nYOUNG COP Sir, is there a problem here? \nMace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them. \nMACE Damn!  I knew it-- \nStrickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him down and vanishes out the door. \nSTRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His expression is opaque. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL \nLenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner, where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off. Beemer moves toward him. \nLENNY Now, Wade, can we talk here, like two human beings-- \nWe think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right, straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed, and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can. \nHe drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe he might have been a cop once. \nLENNY It's not personal. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BALLROOM \nMace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past the tables when... \n... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted. VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks. \nMACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto walks up to her, looking mean and smug. \nMace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch. Corto screams and grabs his face. \nCORTO Aw, not the fucking nose!! \nShe slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired effect. \nMace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move but... \nSuddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night. \nVITA Hey, enjoy the party. \nMace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red \"Exit\" sign above a fire door and goes through. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE \nLenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves down the empty corridor. \nHe approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad sign. \nThe last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant. He looks like Tick did. \nLenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He hits PLAY. \nTHE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt. \nLenny feels the climax building. \nFaith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning. \nSuddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it Faith.  And on her... \n... MAX. \nPants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly. \nLENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not have the strength or the will to stop the tape. \nIN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure. Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump forward onto her, and her face fills the POV. \nFAITH I love you. \nLenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the tape is not over... \nTHE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start. \nLike lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the room, too stunned to resist. \nTRAN You're going to die, you're both going to fucking die. \nWe slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor with his back to the mirror. \nOur eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking fast. \nMAX This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead. \nFAITH Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening. \nMAX Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick. \nFAITH What're you going to do? \nStill in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when he figures that out, starts to splutter. \nFAITH You can't just... kill him. \nMAX I'm not.  Just a little poach job. \nFAITH Jesus. \nMAX Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass. \nTran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his words. \nMAX You shut the fuck up, right now, I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger! \nK-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this has already happened relative to Lenny entering the suite). \nMAX Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true. \nFAITH My God. \nWe don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is about to happen, or to the realization that she has the capacity to let it happen. \nMAX Here's how much I love you, baby. \nShe stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special madness. \nThe POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the fireworks inside Tran's head. \nTHE TAPE ENDS. \nLenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical gloves look incongruous with his tux. \nMAX Don't make any assumptions about our friendship, Lenny. \nLenny stands up, slowly. \nLENNY No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max. \nMAX Only way I could stand your ties. \nMax moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of Lenny's waistband. \nMAX I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice. \nLENNY Where's Faith? \nMAX I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran. \nFaith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in both hands and deflects the gun. \nFAITH Lenny!! \nLenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the room. \nMAX Fucking bitch!! \nBLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away... \nHis \"hair\" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig, containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with effort as he struggles with Lenny. \nHe continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards. The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above. \nMax is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry. Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room, falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters under the couch, out of play. \nMax punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes down to one knee. \nMax pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away from the downthrust. \nThe knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away, pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass. \nMax pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny twists with all his strength and spins Max into the railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and Max topples. \nAs he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he is being strangled by the tie. \nLenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max sees it coming a split second before it happens. \nLenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's hands. \nMax takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck. \nLenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor. Fireworks continue to boom across the sky. \nLenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her. \nHe turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps walking. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nDOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind, walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her, aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns and... \n... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress. Spreg curses and looks around. \nEngelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people out of the way as he runs. \nMace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look. \nSpreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd. \nON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt of her pistol. \nSpreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal. Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe. \nA shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg, using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt. \nShe shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes over and kicks his gun away. \nShe takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises the baton. \nMACE All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!! \nHe slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's. \nThe crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a police baton.  The cops advance toward her. \nMACE Wait.  Let me tell you what's going on here-- \nThe nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down. She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them watches fascinated, gasping. \nMace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg. \nMACE NO!!  NO!!! \nThey crack her with their batons, telling her to stay down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach. \nA BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking cops. \nAnd then they come out of the crowd... one, then three, then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white, Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more. They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down. It becomes a brawl. \nThen cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot- gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above, like the divine light of God. \nMace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up. Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled down. \nThrough the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene. Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses. Then... \nHe points at the two prone cops. \n", "test1_input": "TICK Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it... \nTick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The whole works are covered with congealed blood. \nTICK Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'. \nLENNY Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me. \nTICK Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice. \nLenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet, pulling out a tape. \nLENNY Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'. \nTICK Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.' \nLENNY I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer. \nTICK Ha!  That's for fucking sure. \nLENNY What else you got? \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE/SERIES OF SHOTS \nLenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets. Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food chain. \nLENNY Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a man of my word.  I'll drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks, buddy. (hangs up) Prick. (to the car ahead honking) What kinda move you call that?! Lemmings. \nLenny turns up the radio.  SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as the talk-radio provides commentary. \nLenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the light-poles.  Banners proclaiming the coming \"Millennium LA\" festivities. \nTALK-RADIO HOST ... it's a little after 2 am on December 30th, 1999... the second to last day of the whole darn century, and the phone lines are open.  Dan from Silverlake, you're on the air. \nTransition to a rougher section of town.  Buildings roll by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns. some are burnt-out ruins. \nDAN FROM SILVERLAKE Uh, hi. \nHOST So Dan, are you looking forward to the New Year? \nA building is burning out of control.  In the foreground, silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench. \nDAN Not really.  I mean what's the point?  Nothing changes New Years day.  The economy sucks, gas is over three bucks a gallon, fifth grade kids are shooting each other at recess... the whole thing sucks, right?  So what the hell are we celebrating? \nA shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass. Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants.  Their lives in shopping carts. \nHOST You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one happen to think that us making it 2000 years is worth celebrating-- \nLenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and energy. \nWE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance, Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter. Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic neighborhood. \nBACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER. Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away. Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the number. \nON LENNY DRIVING. \nAhead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint. The cops have thrown a block across the street and are shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through. Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand, not missing a beat in his conversation.  This is just part of life in LA. \nLENNY (on cellular) Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now, can't you hear me knockin'? \nCUT TO LENNY working his way through a crowded club, music pounding.  Strobe lights.  We don't see much.  He hears his phone rings and pulls the tiny DIGITAL CELLULAR out of his breast pocket.  Sticks a finger in his other ear and answers. \nCUT TO LENNY, back in the BMW, on the streets.  On the move. \nLENNY -- so you line up the talent, shoot the clip, get it to me by Monday. OK?  Client wants a guy and two girls, the guy wears... yeah, I know, thinks he's being original. Girls have to be young.  So don't use your mother like you usually do. Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big tits... French tits.  That's it... like Champagne glasses... you got it.  What a pro.  Page me. \nLENNY PULLS UP to the security checkpoint of a gated community.  The white upper-middle class hiding behind walls and paid security. \nLORI If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd know that there won't be another thousand years.  Right now we are in the Last Days, as foretold in the book of-- \nHOST The Last Days?  You mean the coming of the Apocalypse, right?  The Rapture? \nLenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping through about twenty plastic security passes for different parts of town, all bogus.  He finds the right one and flips it onto the dash. \nLORI Yes, that's right.  You only have to look at the signs... there are wars and rumors of wars-- \nThe RENT A COP at the guardshack hits him with his light. \nLENNY (lying) I live here. \nThe cop waves him through.  Lenny is the right color. \nHOST Now just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the Rapture supposed to hit, exactly? Is it midnight New Year's Eve? \nAnd WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy, distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert, the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium approaches. \nHOST Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern Standard or what?  I mean, what time zone is God in, anyway? \n", "test1_true": "Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car.  There is no-one around.  He barely glances at it.  Common sight these days.  If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not going to let it break his rhythm. \nLENNY (cellular) I just got something in, Bobby, you might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai joint goes south, and these three scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run. It's a beauty, two thumbs up. Parental discretion advised.  I'm talking it's the master, not some stepped-on copy.  One of a kind. \nLENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR.  He slides into a booth with NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses too young.  A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning against Skinner. \nLENNY Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man. (fingering his jacket) Red leather.  Nice feminine touch. \nSKINNER (laughing) Fuck you, Nero. \nLENNY Whattya got for me? \nCUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy. Lovemaking in point-of-view.  We look down, see OUR BODY, a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's torso.  The image is dark, a primal impression.  Sound of harsh breathing, rustling sheets. \nBACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his belt, next to his pager.  He is hunched over the table, \"sampling\" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset. Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail. \nLENNY Yeah, I can use this... (to the stoned girl) ... but honey you gotta move your eyes slower next time.  It's too jerky. \nSKINNER It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut her some slack. \nTIGHT SLOWMO SHOTS... ABSTRACT: SQUID tapes and money changing hands.  A SQUID tape sliding sensuously into a deck. \nTIGHT CU LENNY, through the windshield of his car.  Neon moving over him. \nNEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a futuristic war zone. \nINSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage of hyenas shot at night in total darkness. \nThe impression is of a society under siege, an occupied nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the police spotlight define our reality. \nHOST Go ahead, caller, you're on the air. \nVOICE My name's DeWayne, and I got a New Year's resolution for the po-lice. Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down with 2-K. \nCRASH Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids racked up against a storefront.  A dozen 16 year-old girls and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the cops walk up and down, reading IDs. \nHOST 2-K?  What's that DeWayne? \nA group of cops have two black guys proned out.  Nearby a crowd jeers, shouting insults.  A black kid throws a beer bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd. \nDEWAYNE 2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin tomorrow night.  Out with the old and in wit da new.  See for the Man, no new is good new, what I'm sayin. He like to keep it the way it is. But we going to take it, make it new, make it our own.  History gonna start right here, right now-- \nLENNY cuts him off as his cellular call connects. \nLENNY Hi, Dave, this is Lenny. (pause) Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right. Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just that I have something that might be of interest, and since I always call you first-- (pause) Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then. \nCUT TO: \nA GAME ARCADE.  Light and noise as the customers drop quarters for synthetic thrills.  Lenny is talking to a nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named EDUARDO. \nEDUARDO Let me get this straight... you gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a hair net and bang some beautiful babe.  I don't know, I gotta think about this. \nLenny smiles and pulls out a SQUID-net.  He motions Eduardo into the shadows. \nLENNY Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors. \nEDUARDO What's all this squid shit? \nAs Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over Eduardo's head, he holds class. \nLENNY Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test. \nEDUARDO Hey, fuck you, man. \nLENNY Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. (Lenny holds up the recorder) See we call it \"being wired,\" but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean? \nEDUARDO Yeah, right. \nLenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head, turning him into a headbanger.  Eduardo scowls at this set-back to his suavete. \nLENNY Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it? \nEDUARDO No problem. \nLENNY A star is born. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRAIN YARD - NIGHT \nA woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare. \nIRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying, runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane of curly red hair. \nShe is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild. \nShe runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling. Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on. \n", "test1_id": 1815, "test2_input": "LENNY I thought we were friends. \nMACE No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here. \nLENNY So am I.  Just trying to get by. \nMACE No, you're just trying to get off. \nLENNY Macey... I've never seen you like this. \nMACE Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer. \nLENNY I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really. \nMACE Look, I gotta get some sleep. \nLENNY You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies? \nShe hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm. \nMACE (a tiny smile) Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it. \nLENNY Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way. \nMACE Jesus, Lenny. \nLENNY Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her. \nMACE Sure, Lenny. (she puts the car in gear) The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT \nAs Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens the door. \nLENNY Come on, let me buy you a drink. Let's drink and make up. (Mace shakes her head) Alright, I'm going to see Faith. That means you can watch me suffer. I'll be in agony, you'll feel so much better.  Total and thorough payback, whatdya say? \nMace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH \nMace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge. \nThere are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs. \nThe Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain). \nLenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. \nThrough the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind. SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. \nIt is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. \nThe woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot. \nTran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. \n... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second. \nTran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet- thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four. \nLENNY Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse? \nMACE Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and \nLENNY Rams... that's football, right? \nHe can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar. \nMACE Forget her. \nLENNY She still loves me. \nMACE She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this. \nLENNY She's my destiny. \nMACE Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. \nLENNY You'll see. \nMace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny virtually ignores them. \nApproaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him; no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense. \nTran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they stay casual. \n", "test2_true": "TRAN You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays? \nLENNY You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls. \nTRAN (glancing at Faith, back at Lenny) I already got everything I need from you. \nFAITH Cut it out, Tran. \nLENNY Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break. \nTRAN Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist. \nLENNY Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out. \nTRAN I always do. \nLENNY Faith, can I talk to you a second? \nFAITH I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny. \nLENNY I just got to talk to you for one second. \nTRAN About what? \nLENNY That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it? \nTran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly in the general area between his table and Lenny. \nTRAN I don't feel anything between you. See, your trouble is you assume too much, Lenny.  You assume there's something where there's nothing. You assume you have a life.  But you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own. \nFaith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny. \nFAITH (icy) We have nothing to talk about, Lenny. \nTRAN Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car. \nJoey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall. \nLENNY Faith, call me, okay? \nFAITH No, Lenny. \nWade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering. As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him coming the other way. \nLENNY Tick, listen, I can't stop right now.  but I'll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about. \nHe's working the room even as he's getting dragged outside. \nTRAN Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams. \nFAITH Leave him alone, Tran. \nTRAN He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now. \nFAITH You're too goddamned paranoid. \nTRAN Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RETINAL FETISH \nBeemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside. \nA SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the entering crowd. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH \nLenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor. Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks on, crosses to a door, and enters... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH \nA tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana, whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five Lenny as he walks in. \nLENNY So, those rascals still haven't grown back yet, huh? \nTEX (peering under the blanket on his lap) Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now, though. \nLENNY (handing Tex a Squid) Present.  Something I had made.  Let me know what you think. \nTEX Hey, alright.  Got something here for you, too. (passes him an envelope) It just showed up tonight, don't know who left it. \nLENNY Fan mail from some flounder? \n", "test2_id": 1816, "test3_input": "Lenny looks at the envelope, which has \"Nero\" hand-printed in block letters.  Tex takes a pull from a flask as he takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in. He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY. \nIN POV we are on a beach.  Early morning.  We are running flat out, with the wind.  Looking down... we are barefoot on the wet sand.  Foaming water races up the sand and breaks around our strong male legs.  Looking up again, to see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An exquisite moment of pure life force. \nTIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift. \nTex opens his eyes.  Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but Lenny's gone.  Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH \nAs Lenny comes down the stairs from the VJ booth, tearing open the envelope.  An unmarked Squid tape falls into his hand. \nThe HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing. Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes. \nSUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on its eve of judgment. \nLost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak. \nA techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature. \nLenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times. But it always has the same effect on him.  He is transported into another world by her, a world in which there is only the two of them. \nTIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform before.  Holy shit. \nFaith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she possibly could.  Then nothing. \nWhen it is over she just drops the microphone and walk away.  Fuck you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH/BACKSTAGE & DRESSING ROOM \nAt BACKSTAGE, Lenny wends his way through the warren of corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post- modern opium dens.  Sinister and scary.  He glimpses Faith, going into her dressing room.  He hurries... \n... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity table.  She is drenched with sweat.  Spent.  Chugging a beer.  This is the first time they have been alone together in real-time for months.  Pain and the memory of joy. \nLENNY Hi, baby.  I've missed you. \nFAITH I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you. \nLENNY I'm already hurting. \nShe doesn't turn.  Just watches him in the mirror.  Most of the scene plays this way.  It is a cold parody of their love-making playbacks. \nFAITH You have to go.  I mean it. \nLENNY Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble. \nFAITH (startled, turning to him) You talked to Iris?  When? \nLENNY Tonight. \nFAITH Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you? \nLENNY I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on? \nFAITH Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself. \nLENNY It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you. \nFAITH That's a good one, coming from you. \nLENNY Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys. \nFAITH He has his uses too. \nLENNY What?  He gonna record you on his label? \nFAITH Maybe. \nLENNY Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers. \nLenny is right behind her now.  He puts his hands on her shoulders, tenderly. \nLENNY Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will. \nFAITH Damn right. \nLENNY It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him. \nShe shrugs away from his touch.  Cold again. \nFAITH You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around. \nLENNY Max Pelcher?  You're kidding? \nFAITH Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me. \n", "test3_true": "FAITH You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say \"The End.\" You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes. \nShe looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves. As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on the table.  She looks frightened and alone. \nFAITH Hell. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  RETINAL FETISH/CORRIDOR AND MAIN FLOOR \nTurning a corner from the dressing room into the CORRIDOR, Lenny runs into Max. \nLENNY Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy. \nMAX I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it. \nLENNY You should feel like shit. \nMAX I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right? \nLENNY Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. (already over it) Hey, at least you got a job! (slaps him on the back) Watch her for me.  Stay on her. \nMAX I'm on her. \nLenny climbs the stairs to the MAIN FLOOR, pushing his way through the crowd. \nVita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran, whispers in his ear.  Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he stands to go after Lenny. \nMace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks around for Lenny.  Can't find him.  But figures there's got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's looking for Lenny.  She whips out her cellular. \nCUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along hold and hustling him toward the back of the club. \nLenny's cellular rings. \nLENNY Can I get that? \nHe reaches for his cellular, connects with... \nMACE, over by the bar. \nMACE Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I think Tran's got Beemer looking for you. \nBACK TO: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door. \nLENNY Thanks for the tip. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ALLEY/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT \nBeemer shoves Lenny into the alley and shuts the door behind him. \nLENNY I recognize you.  You're Wade Beemer.  Running back for the Rams, am I right? \nBeemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses. \nBEEMER Yeah, that's right. \nLENNY I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what? \nBEEMER Bullshit politics. \nLENNY It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?

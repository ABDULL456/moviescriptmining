As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE. Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and glances back: 
MILO What was that? 
CASS (INNOCENTLY) What was what? 
MILO Did you find something? 
CASS How could I find anything? I'm not the detective. 
MILO Lemme see your purse... 
Milo takes a step closer to her, but: 
VOICE FREEZE! 
Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his eyes. 
GUARD Hotel security! Stay where you are! 
MILO Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably gonna want this. 
Milo holds up HIS GUN. 
GUARD (PANICKED) DROP THE WEAPON, NOW! 
MILO Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload it. 
Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE GUARD'S FACE. 
The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the table. 
Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room. 
INT HALLWAY- EVENING 
Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING: BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls Cass into the stairwell... 
INT STAIRWELL- EVENING 
Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP. 
MILO You're gonna have to jump. 
CASS I can't. 
Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE WINDOW. 
EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING 
Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO THE GROUND. 
Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR. 
BOBBY (O.S.) Ok, so some guy you're looking for has disappeared. You want me to put out an all-points on him? 
INT CADILLAC- EVENING 
Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino. 
MILO (into phone) The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks dirty cops might be involved. 
SPLIT-SCREEN: 
INT POLICE STATION- EVENING 
Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room, busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his chair. 
BOBBY Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when you're around her your brain turns to mush. 
MILO Yeah, well, that doesn't change the fact that someone took a couple shots at us. 
Beat. 
BOBBY You get a plate number? 
MILO Happened too quick. But it was a dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey, New Jersey plates, and the car was wrecked, I know that. 
Bobby thinks this over. 
BOBBY Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I can find. Just hold tight, Ok? 
Milo checks his watch. 
MILO Ok. But we're kinda on a clock here.

It does? 
LONE 
Most women I know pretend to be tougher than they really are. (beat) Listen... if you ever need someone -- to look out for you, keep an eye on -- (changing tack) -- or whatever -- I'm available. He pulls a card from his wallet, passes it to her. 
PATIENCE 
Wow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LONE 
(catching himself) Oh hey, I didn't mean that to sound like a come-on 
PATIENCE 
(disappointed) Oh. 
LONE 
I mean, unless you... (rising) I'm just going to shut up now and go. 
PATIENCE 
See you around. 
LONE 
Yeah, you will. He gives her a wave and heads out of the coffee shop.      A broad smile spreads over Patience's face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AVENAL FACTORY - DAY 
LAUREL'S SMILING FACE on a BILLBOARD. It's only there for a moment, quickly plastered over with -- A NEW BILLBOARD featuring DRINA'S FACE. We're outside a dramatic, gated industrial COMPLEX, TRUCKS with the AVENAL LOGO, a sprawling CHEMICAL FACTORY at the center. 
INT. AVENAL FACTORY - GEORGES' OFFICE - DAY 
HUGE VATS, DUCTS, PIPES, etc., it's a busy, VERY NOISY environment. CAMERA FINDS GEORGES' OFFICE, large windows overlooking the factory floor. INSIDE, behind the thick windows, it's SILENT.       This is a hard, masculine space, all steel and wood. GEORGES stands by a table, WESLEY and ANGEL at his side; IVAN NEVSKI, 50s, a smoldering Russian scientist, is showing them 
MEDICAL PHOTOS of people's faces, the eyes covered with black BARS -- the skin is BLOTCHED, lumpy, something very wrong. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GEORGES flips through these quickly, his tone frustrated. 
GEORGES 
Okay, with too much YP-3 you get side-effects -- but too much of anything is bad for you -- tap water, sunshine, cigarettes -- 
ANGEL 
It's like leprosy or something... 
GEORGES 
The point   is, now that we've adjusted the formula, Beaunique   works. Plumps the skin, removes wrinkles,   leaves a nice rosy glow -- it's perfectly safe now,   my own wife uses it... His voice trails off as he considers this fact. He glances at the medical pictures, puts them aside. Airy denial: 
GEORGES 
You want to be beautiful, you've got to make certain sacrifices. I mean, look at Botox, women are lining up to get their faces paralyzed. NEVSKI has been doing a slow burn, now blurts out: 
NEVSKI 
Enough! Pretending my YP-3 is only for your cosmetics, feh! You've known about these "side- effects" from the start, they are not side-effects at all -- 
GEORGES 
What?   You're not making sense -- 
NEVSKI 
I thought I'd left this sort of madness behind me - - then I find out you've been in contact with Xavier Bartok -- 
GEORGES 
I've never heard of the man. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEVSKI 
I still have connections. You may have used me, but I am not a fool. 
GEORGES 
Doctor Nevski, is it possible you've gone insane? NEVSKI spins on his heel and storms out. 
ANGEL 
Russians, sheesh. 
GEORGES

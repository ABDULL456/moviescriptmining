A lone condom disregarded on the floor. 
We see his bedside drawer ajar. 
He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.

Later - 
BRANDON lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight on. 
SISSY enters. BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches. 
SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white sheet. Snuggles up to BRANDON 
BRANDON I have to be up and out by seven. 
SISSY inhales through her teeth. 
SISSY (to herself) It's cold. 
Uncomfortable SILENCE- 
BRANDON Sissy, get out of my room? 
SISSY doesn't move. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Sissy, get out of my room. 
All this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs- 
BRANDON (CONT'D) GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT! 
SISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and slowly walks around the bed. 
SISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit.

Midday- 
The office is in full flow- 
BRANDON crosses it, clearly worse for wear. 
A TECHNICIAN wheels a computer out of BRANDON's office. 
STEVEN (in passing) Hey slacker, your computer's back. 
BRANDON heads towards his desk, stopping on seeing- 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Dave's looking for you. 
STEVEN exits again. 
BRANDON observes, his computer is back at his desk.

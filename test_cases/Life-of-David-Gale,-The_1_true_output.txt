Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book. 
She's almost in tears, yelling. 
BITSEY Everyone! Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk! How far is it? 
ZACK Took me 30 this afternoon. You've got 26, maybe more. 
BITSEY I'll make it. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE 
The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist. 
EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE 
The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring stop signs. 
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE 
The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and disappears into the fog. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE 
The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on. 
She punches scan. 
BITSEY (to the radio) Give me the time. Give me the goddamn time. 
EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE 
The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles." 
INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE 
Bitsey smells something. 
EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE 
The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand. 
She doesn't close the door. Starts running. 
Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. 
She runs, and runs. 
A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns, starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on. 
She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past a sleepy farmhouse. 
She runs, and runs. 
She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. 
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. 
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold. 
Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights. They rise on hill and then fall behind another. 
They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach. The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION. She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot hear her. We HEAR NOTHING. 
INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - SUNRISE 
In the b.g., Dusty walks out the front door carrying two large suitcases. On his desk in the f.g. is a radiator cap.

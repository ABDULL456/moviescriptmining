TARA My weed! 
EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder. His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD drops ZOIL and runs to his car. 
ZOIL Damnit Haggard, wait! HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black. 
GRAHAM Your dad's persistent, isn't he? 
RUTH You have no idea. CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror. 
CLIVE I think we have a problem. 
GRAHAM What do we do? 
PAUL Go left. 
CLIVE What? 
PAUL 
GO LEFT! CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub. 
INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING 
ZOIL 
(TO HIMSELF) What the hell is he doing?! 
VOICE (O.S.) Zoil. Progress report! 
ZOIL Sir, I- 
INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING 
HAGGARD In pursuit, sir. 
VOICE Who the hell is this? 
HAGGARD Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been compromised. I'm assuming command. 
ZOIL (O.S.) Now wait a goddamn minute! 
VOICE I don't give a shit who's in command. Where' my fucking mooncoon?! 
HAGGARD Just ahead of me sir. We're heading East across scrubland just North of Mitchell Creek. 
VOICE I don't wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother fucker is under glass. 
HAGGARD Yes sir! HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES. HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLIVE They're trying to overtake. 
PAUL Don't let him get past. 
CLIVE Shall I ram him? 
RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL 
YES! CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood. 
INT. RV - EVENING 
CLIVE What are we doing exactly?

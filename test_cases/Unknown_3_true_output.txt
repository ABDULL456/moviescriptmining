KA-BOOM! The blast ROCKS the room. People tumble, chandelier falls. KER-ASH! LIZ dives aside as a column SLAMS down near her. SPRINKLERS burst on. Water rains down. Main lights black out... beat, then emergency lights come on. Total CHAOS. Find... BRESSLER, clutching his DAUGHTERS as SECURITY reaches them, surrounding them, searching for signs of Martin... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GINA, dazed, bleeding, picks herself up. Searching the room for Martin... gone. 
INT. KITCHEN. HOTEL IMPERIAL -_CONTINUOUS 
Food-laden serving carts, cook-tops, pots and pans, knives. Falling plaster and debris... deserted. Liz walks through, brisk, angry. Dress torn, a cut across her forehead. She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the sportsbag. Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a knife, starts to toss it as well... .She STOPS. Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the stainless steel surface in front of her. 
LIZ .Hello, Martin. REVOLVING... to find Martin there. Bleeding, hurt, covered is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands. 
LIZ (CONT'D) Be careful, that might go off. She turns to face him. Hair slicked, clothes drenched. Stunning despite everything 
LIZ (CONT'D) Five years as a team... and you end it like this. Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated in her palm. Martin tracks it, steadies the gun. 
MARTIN Don't. Keep your hands where I can see them. Please... GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall, SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little. 
LIZ You know, working with you... it almost wasn't work. We were so good... You, were so good. At the job. At other things... She smiles a little, warming. 
LIZ (CONT'D) Don't you want to know your real name? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN Let go of the knife, Liz. 
LIZ 'Liz?'... Don't you want to know y real name? Don't you still want... me? She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin stepping back... 
MARTIN Please, just stop, Liz... Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto the floor. 
MARTIN His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING in agony as he rips it out, looking up at... 
LIZ A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus, smile... 
LIZ You'll never know. You'll never know who you are... A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently closes her eyelids. 
EXT. HOTEL IMPERIAL - NIGHT 
Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP... as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke. 
GINA moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of people still pouring from the building... She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal, love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Gut instinct wins. She takes a step towards him, he pulls her tight to him. Holds on. All he has. All he knows. 
IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE Hotel survivors... Bressler: shaken, oblivious that he's the epicenter and object of the destruction all around him...

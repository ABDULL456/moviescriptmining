He exits instantly. 
HAROLD Now that's what I call fun. 
PENELOPE Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary. 
HAROLD You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up. 
PENELOPE I did? 
HAROLD We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now. 
PENELOPE A trip, you mean? 
HAROLD I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here. (to PAUL) Go out and play. 
PAUL Play? 
HAROLD Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours. 
PENELOPE He hasn't had breakfast yet. 
HAROLD Buy yourself breakfast. (takes his billfold from his hip pocket, hands PAUL a $100 bill) There we go. 
PAUL A hundred dollars! 
HAROLD The smallest thing I've got. 
PAUL Can I get dressed first? 
HAROLD Make it fast. 
PAUL exits to his bedroom.  HAROLD turns to PENELOPE. 
HAROLD Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon! 
PENELOPE It's so--so stark. 
HAROLD You used to like it stark! 
PENELOPE Just--bang--we have a honeymoon. 
HAROLD (beginning to stalk her cunningly) I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves! 
PENELOPE wants to run, but doesn't. 
HAROLD Good!  You held your ground. 
HAROLD is very close now, but not touching her. 
HAROLD Now--turn around, if you would. 
PENELOPE Turn around? 
HAROLD (laughing) I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around. 
PENELOPE obeys. 
HAROLD I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream. (touches her shoulders gently, expertly) So tense, so tense. 
PENELOPE You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way. 
HAROLD You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time. 
PENELOPE I have a brain. 
HAROLD We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl. 
PAUL (entering, dressed to go out and play) Dad--

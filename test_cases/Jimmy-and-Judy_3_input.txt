Judy fidgets again, then... 
JUDY (blows her top) Because we're both fucking weird! 
Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more. 
JUDY Because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. And God made us for each other and I fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it! 
Judy's out of breath.    Camera still points at her. 
JUDY That's right, right? 
Judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down. 
CAMERA ON: 
I/E. HIGHWAY FIRST-KISS-SMILEY-FACE/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY 
Jimmy is driving in his car with Judy in the passenger seat. Judy has the camera and she is interviewing Jimmy as he drives. 
JUDY (O.C.) Where are you taking me? 
JIMMY To a beautiful place. 
JUDY (O.C.) Where? 
JIMMY Chuck E. Cheese. 
Judy and Jimmy laugh together. 
JUDY (O.C.) No seriously. 
JIMMY I can't tell you.    It'll ruin it. 
JUDY (O.C.) Fine. 
Judy sulks for a second. 
JUDY (O.C.) Jimmy, can I ask you something? 
JIMMY Anything. 
JUDY (O.C.) Do you hate your parents? 
JIMMY Yes, but I understand them. 
JUDY (O.C.) What's to understand? 
JIMMY Lots of things. 
JUDY (O.C.) Like what? 
JIMMY I understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid-life crisis. Generally when an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own lives. They see us as a younger, better version of themselves. (MORE) 
JIMMY (cont'd) They feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval. They used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages, but once we no longer need Mom to nurture our bruises or Dad to be our hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question. 
JUDY (O.C.) How do you know all these things? 
JIMMY When you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. And without any of those things I have nothing but time to think about stuff. 
JUDY (O.C.) You are SO smart. 
JIMMY You are so beautiful. 
Long pause.   Judy doesn't know how to react. 
JUDY (O.C.) You think I'm pretty? 
JIMMY I think you're the most beautiful person I have ever met. The most beautiful person in the universe. 
JUDY (O.C.) No one has ever told me that. 
JIMMY Get used to hearing it. 
JUDY (O.C.) Do you think I'm smart? 
JIMMY Yes. 
JUDY (O.C.) Do you think I'm fat? 
JIMMY Yes. 
JUDY (O.C.) How could you say that? I only way a hundred and ten pounds. 
JIMMY Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said flat. As in flat chested. 
JUDY (O.C.) I am not FLAT! 
Judy smacks him. 
JIMMY Prove it. 
JUDY (O.C.) I don't have to prove it.   Here look.

Jordan grabs Naomi. All at once the boat dips down at an        * impossibly steep angle, until it's pointing almost              * straight down. Captain Ted jams the throttle and the            * boat jerks forward, rising up the face of a giant rogue         * wave, which curls over the top of the bridge and...             * 
KABOOM! -- Blackness. Slowly, painfully, the boat pops          * up from beneath the water, its helicopter RIPPING from          * the deck and crashing into the sea.                             *

211   INT. ITALIAN NAVAL DESTROYER - BELOW DECK - NIGHT                   *211 (SUMMER `96) 
Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends, and the yacht's Crew Members dance to blaring techno music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on. 
JORDAN (V.O.) The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine. Then they make you dance. 
Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Did you see that? That was the plane I sent for to come get us. I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine, three people killed. You want a sign from God, well after all this I finally got the message. I had to make some fucking changes. 
FADE OUT.

Jordan, looking healthier than we've seen him thus far,             * sits on the couch; stacks of paperwork on the coffee                * table. After a few beats, Naomi enters from the kitchen.            *

WE START WITH FLASHES OF THE SEMINAR: Jordan in front of a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience. 
JORDAN At the essence of every personal interaction, of every business transaction, of every effective human communication is PERSUASION... once you learn to control the linguistic encounter, you will be SHOCKED at what will happen... you are a person worth listening to, and taking it one step higher than that, you are someone who can help them achieve their goals...

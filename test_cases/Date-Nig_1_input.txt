PHIL Oh God. 
CLARA How do we get out of here? 
INT. ING'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Manning talks in his off ice. 
E 
LIEUTENANT MANNING Uh huh. I know you don't. It will be contained. Right now. Hanging up the phone, Manning walks quickly back through the police station to the interview room. He stops in the doorway... .it's EMPTY. Confused, he turns to an OFFICER outside at the desk. 
LIEUTENANT MANNING 
(CONT'D) Where'd they go? 
OFFICER They said you were done with them. Manning walks quickly back to his office. Sitting behind his desk, Manning enters a password on his computer and starts typing out an ALL POINTS BULLETIN. We are CLOSE UP on the computer screen as the words come 
UP 
ALL LOCAL AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT... PHIL AND CLARA 
FOSTER... FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE... ARMED AND DANGEROUS. 
INT. TOWNCAR - LATE 
Clara drives as Phil scans the rearview mirror from the passenger seat. 
CLARA We can't just go to another police station, Phil! We don't know how big this is! It might not just be Manning! 
PHIL Well then we're screwed! Who do we go to? The FBI? The CIA? 
CLARA 
(SHAKES HEAD) They're not going to believe us over a Police Lieutenant! 
(REALIZING) Shit. This is their car, Phil. We gotta lose it too. Searching the street, Clara spots a OPEN PARKING SPACE. She whips the wheel around, trying to parallel park into the space. 
RÏ¿½ 
U 
PHIL You've got it, Clara. Spin it back now! 
CLARA just let me do it, She spins too late and too severely, hitting the curb. 
CLARA (CONT'D) Dammit! I hate this! 
PHIL It's all right. You just should have spun it when I told you to. Flustered, she pulls back out and tries again. 
PHIL (CONT'D) rn! Quick! 
CLARA Would you stop it? You're stressing me out! Angry, Clara whips the car back into the spot, NAILING the car behind them and setting off a loud CAR ALARM WITH 
FLASHING LIGH` 
Hearing the alarm, a LARGE MAN rushes out of a restaurant nearby, looking at them. 
LARGE MAN Hey! You just hit my The Large Man stomps toward them. 
PHIL Run! Phil and Clara get out of the car and run away on The Large Man marches over and inspects his bumpe yells after them. 
L Assholes! 
EY INS LAT They catch their breath in the alley. OK. So we've got no car. They know where we live. So where can we- 
(REALIZES SOMETHING) shit. 
Clara's eyes go wide as it hits her as well. 
CLARA Ollie. Phil takes out his cellphone and quickly dials, listening as Ruth PICKS UP.

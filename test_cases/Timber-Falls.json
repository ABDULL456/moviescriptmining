{"train": "TIMBER FALLS \nWritten by Dan Kay \nAll Revisions written by Tony Giglio \nSeptember 2006 \nFADE IN: \n1   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         1 \nCLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks. \nCLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth. \nCLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together. \nCLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS. \nFROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table. \nAN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.    OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD- CURDLING SCREAM cries out. \nThe Young Woman's breathing intensifies.   She watches the light bulb, listens to the screams. \nThe light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.    Peace for a moment. But she knows that won't last. \n2   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         2 \nA YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess. \nCLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH, sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by... \nA CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.    His left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together again... SPARKS FLY. \nYOUNG MAN Please-please stop. D-don't. \nThe Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side. \nELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE. \n3   INT. TORTURE ROOM #1                                           3 \nCLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.   The screams of the Young Man echo through the room. \nThe Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and... \nHer right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up. \nThe light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop. \nThe Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound. \nNo time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves. \n4   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                            4 \nCLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and... ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS. \n5   INT.   CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1                                    5 \nThe Young Woman's left hand POPS free.    Blood oozes out. \nOFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN. \nShe sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain. Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can. \nThe SCREAMS STOP.   Lights return to normal. \nHalf way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds. \n6   INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2                                   6 \nThe Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear. It is. \nWe're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right. The door across from her is slightly ajar... \nYOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the door and the Young Man. \nThe Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her. \nTHE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself. \nThe Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words \"I Love you\". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as... \nLIGHTS FLICKER.     OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again. \nMIKE Come on.   Next one. \nSheryl scrolls again, hits play. \nMIKE \"Bullets\" by the Editors. \nSheryl frowns.   Mike grins and shoots her a wink. \nSHERYL You loaded these songs. You don't need to be so impressed with yourself. \nMIKE I know I don't have to be. \nSHERYL I haven't even heard of half these bands. \nMIKE It's called good music. You should try to familiarize yourself with it, instead of listening to the crap you do. \nSHERYL I listen to crap? \nMIKE Hurts me to be the one to tell you. \nSHERYL I'm sure it does. \nMIKE You gotta be more like me, baby. Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm looking for the next Beatles, U2 or Radiohead. \nSheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles. \nSHERYL So, where does this band fall into that group? \nThe music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, \"I WANT TO BE A COWBOY\" blares. \nSHERYL Fresh, new or cutting edge? \nMike immediately begins to backtrack. \nMIKE How'd that get on there? \nSHERYL You loaded the songs.   You tell me? \nMIKE Must be a mistake. \nSHERYL Says here you've listened to it 86 times. \nBusted. \nSHERYL Is this true? Have you always wanted to be a cowboy? \nSheryl spies more... \nSHERYL You also got \"Men Without Hats\" greatest hits? I didn't know they qualified for a greatest hits album. Can you break me off a little \"Safety Dance\"? \nMike reaches for the MP3 player. \nMIKE Okay, give me that. \nThe Passat speeds past a \"West Virginia\" state sign. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          7. \n16   EXT.   NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - DAY                           16 \nThe sun BURNS above.   The Passat turns into the park. \n17   EXT.   PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY                      17 \nThe Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. Next to the lot is the Ranger Station. \n18   INT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                              18 \nMaps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant bear, fill in the gaps. \nMike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor. \nSAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike wait. And wait. Then... \nMIKE Good morning. \nSam holds up a \"wait a second\" finger.     After a beat... \nSAM Now what can I do you two for? \nSheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc. \nMIKE Well...ah... \nSAM First time here and you're not quite sure where to begin. \nSheryl grabs a National Park Information flier. \nSheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service. \nMIKE You getting anything? \nSheryl checks her phone and shakes her head \"no.\" \nMIKE I'll lock them in the car. \nSHERYL I'll take mine. \nMIKE Why? \nSHERYL Just to annoy you. \nMIKE Seriously... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         11. \nSHERYL In an emergency, I'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there. \nHuh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment. \nSheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. Zips it shut. \nANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain. Mike locks the door. \nMIKE Okay, we all set? \nSHERYL (Excited) Yup. \nMIKE Let's do this. \nMike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof. \nSHERYL Hey, Einstein. What do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us? \nMike swallows his pride and retreats to the car. \nMIKE I was just seeing if you were paying attention. \nMike comes back to the car for the tent.   Sheryl shakes her head and smiles. \n21   EXT.   BASE TRAIL #1 - DAY                                   21 \nThe mountain is breathtaking.    Nature at its best. \nMike and Sheryl have begun their ascent. \nSHERYL It could be fun. \nMIKE Not a chance. High School reunions serve only two purposes... to try to (MORE) \nMIKE (cont'd) rehash so-called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super-model. \nSHERYL So what were you? \nMIKE Me?   I was a stoner. \nSHERYL So what does that mean? \nMIKE How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was high all the time. \nSheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. \nSweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana. \nMIKE Where'd you get that bandana? \nSHERYL It's cute, right? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your eyes. \nMIKE And when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe... \nSHERYL Oh...well...it was the last one... \nMIKE The last one? \nSHERYL Yeah... \nMIKE The entire Army-Navy store... sold out? \nSHERYL Completely. There was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute. \nSheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006   13. \nSHERYL Here... You big baby. \nSHERYL When I see an opening. \nMIKE (Checks map) That path she was talking about winds through these falls. What do you think? \nSHERYL I think... if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain. \nMIKE And they say romance is dead. (Smiling wide) Timber Falls it is. \nThey throw on their backpacks and head on their way. \nMIKE Who's Lewis and/or Clark? \nSHERYL You really were stoned through high school. \nAs Mike and Sheryl trek up the path... \nANGLE ON - The directional sign, \"Timber Falls\" \n23   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #1 - DAY                              23 \nLooking back down on the thin path. FIND - Sheryl and Mike continuing their trek. (SPLINTER UNIT) \nMike maneuvers around a massive tree. He freezes. Gestures for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, \"Don't Move.\" \nSheryl stops, startled.     Mike motions towards... \nA MOUNTAIN STAG, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant in the distance. \nSheryl quietly slides out her digital camera.    Snaps a photo of the animal. \nThe Stag stops chewing and looks at them.    After a long beat, the Stag skips away through the trees. \nSheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles. \nMike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl. He helps remove her backpack and kisses her. She kisses him back. \nANGLE ON - Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt. \nMIKE You're going to lose that out here. \nSHERYL It's fine. I never take it off. Not since you gave it to me. Betcha don't remember... \nMIKE ...February 27, 2006. \nSheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike. Speechless. \nMIKE I remember every moment with you. \nSHERYL I've got you so whipped. \nThey kiss. Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap. He leans back, better positioning, places his hand down, when... \nMIKE OUCH!   FUCK! \nMike brings his hand back up.    BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL CUT across his palm. \nSHERYL What? \nMIKE My hand... Something stuck it. \nSheryl quickly examines the cut. Mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy. He turns away from the wound. \nSHERYL It's okay. It's not too deep.      Let me get the first aid kit. \nSheryl rummages through her bag. Mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing. \nSheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can.    She applies some peroxide... \nMIKE Fuck.   That stung. \nSHERYL Gotta clean the wound, baby. \n24   OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES--                                24 \nFrom a distance... A SICKLE BLADE enters frame, pulls a branch aside. Sheryl attends to Mike's wound. \nThe POV narrows... solely on SHERYL. \n25   TIMBER FALLS, TRAIL #1--                                      25 \nMike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes. \nMIKE You know me and blood... we don't do so well. \nSHERYL I know. (She finishes) All done. \nOFF SCREEN: CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket. \nOkay, he had that coming. \nMIKE Truce? \nSHERYL Truce. \nHe takes her in.   She's quite a sight. He sits down next to her. They kiss.    Then... Mike breaks the embrace. \nMIKE Don't disappear on me again. \nSheryl mouths the words, \"I promise.\"    Crosses her heart. \nHe leans in, they kiss again.   Soft and sweet at first.   Then it deepens. \nSheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss again. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another. \nMike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her legs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about to remove it, when: \nDARRYL (O.S.) Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out. \nDARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE, 20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by... \nBRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other. \nDARRYL Looks like we got ourselves a little party. \nBrody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike, who shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra back closed. \nMIKE We were just moving our way up the mountain. \nLONNIE You were moving your way'round more than just that. \nSheryl eyes her discarded clothes.   Darryl spots them too. He grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them. \nDARRYL (Referring to the smell) Like a peach. \nMike tries to seem relaxed and friendly. \nBRODY You folks best be careful about what you do up here... Never know who's watching. \nMIKE Appreciate the advice...I think we learned our lesson. \nBrody nods as he looks them up and down. \nLONNIE You city folk, ain't ya? Up from Charleston roughing it, seeing how the \"other\" half lives? \nMIKE No, we're from Virginia, just up for a weekend trip. And, uh... you folks live up here? \nBrody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike. \nBRODY It's easy to spot the city folk. It's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be. \nMIKE I think you just startled us is all. \nSheryl looks over at... \n...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly flails it about. \nUncomfortable silence. \nMIKE We'll just be on our way. (Re: Sheryl's shorts) May I have those? \nA bold move from Mike. \nDARRYL Finders keepers. \nLong beat.    Tension high. \nBRODY Darryl. \nBrody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back. \nDarryl reluctantly obliges. \nMike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does. \nMike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun. \nBRODY Where you runnin' off to? \nLONNIE Yeah, we just getting acquainted and shit. \nMike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest. He can no longer hide his fear. \nMIKE We just want to get a little further along before the sun sets. \nDarryl eyes the sky.    The sun beams down through the trees. \nMike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl. \n27   EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                             27 \nThe sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a magnificent light. \n28   EXT.   WATERFALL - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #2 - DAY                28 \nMike and Sheryl move right along.     Still not speaking. \nThe path forks at a BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL. Mike stops, faces the falls, turns to see... Sheryl behind him, catching up. As she does, she slips... \nMIKE You alright? \nSHERYL (balances herself) Yeah. \nShe's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's hand and holds it. \nMIKE I'm sorry. \nSHERYL Do you know how many times I've had someone die on me? How many children? I stopped keeping count. \nMIKE I thought... I wasn't thinking.       What do you want me to do? \nSHERYL Get rid of the gun. \nMIKE What... now? Out here? \nShe holds firm. \nMIKE I can't just leave it here in the woods, some kid could find it. \nSHERYL Then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home, you get rid of the gun. \nMike thinks about it.    His instincts SCREAMING not to do this, then... \nSHERYL Please. \nMike relents. He removes his backpack, ZIPS it open.    He pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out. \nMike WITH A DEEP BREATH, TOSSES THE BULLETS into the woods. \nSHERYL Was that all of them? \nMIKE Yes. \nMike steps back to Sheryl, they hug. \nSHERYL Thank you. \nCRACK! A strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl. Mike turns as well. Their eyes WIDEN. \nCRACK! The FIGURE emerges from the clearing, practically landing on top of them. It's... \nCLYDE, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly. He's got a weed cutter in his hands, wears a PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. He's just as surprised to see them. \nSheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile. \nCLYDE Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks. Just clearing some of the brush off (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT        OCTOBER 17, 2006    28. \nCLYDE (cont'd) the path. We had some heavy rains this past week, knocked some trees and branches down. One of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday, but... if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. \nMIKE It's fine. We were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled. \nCLYDE It's not, but... It's one of my favorite spots, so I often find an excuse to swing by. \nSHERYL It's gorgeous. \nCLYDE Yup. There are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so... inviting as this one. Now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself... How long's your stay? \nSHERYL Just til Sunday. \nCLYDE Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on the other side. It would take you a couple nights just to get there. \nSHERYL Maybe next time. \nMIKE This is a quickie trip. Just getting out of the city for a couple days. \nCLYDE The city, huh. Which? If it's Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya. Whole place smells like feet. I gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local Doc. Not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then... \nSHERYL No, we're not from Charleston. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006             29. \nMIKE But apparently we look like we are. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n33   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 33 \nSTARS FILL THE SKY. Crickets chirp, but aside from that, peace and quiet reign. \nA fire CRACKLES. A tent for two has been pitched. Dirty pots, pans litter the area. Dinner's over and done. \nMike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire.   A sleeping bag wrapped around them. \nMIKE That was... the worst dinner ever. \nSHERYL (Beat) You cooked. \nMIKE Yeah, I'm aware. (Beat) You know what would make this evening perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole jar of it. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. \"I have a jar of moonshine.\" Matter of fact, I've got enough to share with our entire congregation... \nSHERYL ... in Charleston. \nMIKE Our home city, of course. But I should start with you... Would you like some moonshine? \nSheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully. \nMIKE Then what would you like? \nSHERYL I'd like to fuck you. \nMIKE Not very Christian of you. \nSHERYL I'm more Old Testament. \nMIKE What's that mean? \nSHERYL Not sure. But I think it's the nastier of the two books. \nSheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss. Strong and deep. Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. She stands up, pulls Mike into the tent with her. \n34   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            34 \nSheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the T-shirt.    Mike kicks off his shoes, drops his pants. \nMike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off. \nSheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside.    Mike slides her panties down her legs and off. \nFew things in life can be described as perfect.         Sheryl's naked body is one of them. \nSheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him.        She reaches down and slides Mike inside her. \nSheryl KISSES Mike. He slides his hands around Sheryl's butt. Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip HARD. \nThe lovers move in unison.    Perfection. \n35     EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 35 \nInside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue.      Their campfire still burns. Suddenly... \nA SHADOW creeps into frame.    Then a BOOT.    Someone's outside their tent. \n36     INT. TENT - NIGHT                                                  36 \nBreaths get shorter, stronger. Sheryl and Mike build to climax. They don't/ can't notice... \nA SHADOW passes across the wall of the tent. \nThe last final moments before... climax. The lovers EXHALE. Sheryl crashes on top of Mike. He wraps his arms tightly around her. \nTIME CUT TO: \n36 A   EXT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 A \nThe last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT. \n36 B   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 B \nMike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed together as one. \nMIKE I was good. I mean, even better than usual. \nSHERYL If you don't say so... \nMIKE ... if I don't say so myself, yeah. Top notch performance. What, you disagree? \nSHERYL Nah, it was good.   Do you think I had anything to do... \nMIKE No.   All me. \nSHERYL Fine. (Beat; cautious) I liked what the old woman said about us earlier. \nIn the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight. It's Sheryl's locket. The chain broken. He picks it up... \nMIKE (Calls out) Sheryl! \nMike looks around. He's completely alone.     The blood drains from his face. Mike pockets the necklace. \nHe starts into the water... did she drown?    Just as he gets knee deep... \nOFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT! \nMike stops, turns back looking at the forest. \nMIKE Sheryl! \nHe hustles out of the water, heading for the woods. \n45   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY                                  45 \nMike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction and slips, BANGING his knee. \nMIKE Fuck! (Top of his lungs) Sheryl! \nMike pushes himself up, continues on. \n46   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY                               46 \nMike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch of trees and hustles down a slope. \n47   EXT.   CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       47 \nMike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing.        Looking around wildly... \nPOV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the same? Not even sure which direction he just came from. \nMIKE Sheryl! \nStill nothing.   Mike swallows.     What to do now? \nSMASH CUT TO: \n48   EXT.   WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  48 \nTIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees.     HIS LEGS trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then... \nMike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out. \nThe sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there. \nMike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE. \nHe removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it around his wound. \nMike lays back, stares up into the sky.     Tries to catch his breath, calm down. Then... \nFaint sound of LAUGHTER. \nMike sits up.     Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER. \nMike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction. \n49   EXT.   WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  49 \nMike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees.     He stops at the top and looks down. \nPOV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles. \nMike's about fifteen feet above them.      He narrows his focus in on... \nMIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand.     It's Sheryl's blue hikers' towel. \nMike turns red with fury.    He looks back down... \nMIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder. \nMike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near a tree, parallel to him. \n50   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY                             50 \nDarryl and Lonnie continue along, until... \nOFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK. \nDarryl stops, turns.    Lonnie looks at Daryl. \nLONNIE What is it? Hear something? \nDarryl holds his look into the woods, then... \nMike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow.      He freezes, completely floored. \nEverything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits, everything. Even the fire pit. \nMike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless. \nHe SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells.       He closes it, heads back into the woods. \n53   OMIT                                                              53 \n54   EXT.   WOODS #3, TIMBER FALLS TRAILS - DAY                        54 \nMike moves deeper into the woods.      He's a mix of paranoia and determination. \nMike pauses, catching his breath, when... A FEW BLOOD DROPS OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the blood. What the fuck? \nA couple more DROPS hit him.    Mike LOOKS UP... \nA MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by coarse thick ropes. \nMike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware...       A FEW FEET BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP. \nMike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer... his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP... \nSNAP! CRUNCH!    MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN ON HIS LEG! \nMike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel. \nMIKE HELP!?!?! \nMike writhes in pain on the ground.    His eyes watering.     The pain UNBEARABLE. Then... \nMIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden. \nMike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then... \nIda bends down next to Mike. \nIDA Michael, can you hear me?    Michael... \nHer words fade out.    He promptly PASSES OUT. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS. \nFADE IN: \n55   INT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                       55 \nCLOSE ON - Mike's eyes SNAP open, dart side to side, blink. \nREVEAL - Mike lays on a ragged couch.    The place is dark and dusty. A glance around... \nGaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT. \nMike's memory slowly comes back.    He leans up when... \nMIKE Ow! \nA sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced the Gray Bandana on his arm. \nIda enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen. She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops. \nIDA Look who's up. \nMIKE Where am I? \nIDA You're in my home, Michael. You gave me quite a scare. I thought I lost you. \nIda grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and walks back to Mike. \nIDA Lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it. I know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing. That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I'll get some \"evening primrose\" in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well... just about everything. So's do I. \nIda unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound. \nIDA Try and relax. \nIda cleans the wound.    Mike winces.   He can't watch. \nMIKE Thank you.     For saving my life. \nIDA You don't have to thank me. Up here, we take care of one another. That's the only way any of us survive. \nMIKE Um... (Thinks...) I'm sorry, but I don't know your name. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006      44. \nA SCREAM cries out. \nMIKE Sheryl!? \nMike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and... \n62   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                  62 \nMike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO THE ROOM, falls across... \nSheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches. \nSheryl and Mike's eyes lock.     Euphoria, pain all at once. \nMIKE Oh my God. \nMike runs to her, touches her face.    He checks the ropes tying Sheryl. They're very secure. \nMIKE I need something to cut you down, baby. \nSheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room. \nMike follows her gaze... Searching wildly...       scanning the room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS! \nON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT, then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE. \nMike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl.      He slides the blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES.      Several tense moments later... the rope breaks. \nMike tosses the rope and gag away.    They kiss. \nMIKE Are you okay? \nSHERYL Get me out of here.    Hurry. \nMike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists. \nSHERYL He'll be back soon. \nMIKE Who's he? \nOFF SCREEN: A LOUD THUD resounds.    Where did it come from? \nNot wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort. \nSHERYL Come on, come on, come on... \nSNAP!   Finally, the ropes tear.   Sheryl's free.     Just as... \nALL THE LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY GO OUT. COMPLETE AND TOTAL DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a short, but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her. \nBREATHING INTENSIFIES.    Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each other's arms. Then... \nMike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT.      He feels around for the bench, when... WHACK. \nMIKE Fuck! \nHe banged his injured leg on something. \nSHERYL (Whispers) What are you doing? \nMike reaches the tool bench, feels around.    Finds it. \nSHERYL (Whispers) Mike? Mike? \nMike TURNS ON THE FLASHLIGHT.    The beam CUTS through the darkness and onto... \nThe Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike brandishing his axe/sickle. \nSHERYL SCREAMS! \nThe Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR. \nMike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife. \nMIKE Sheryl, run! \nBut Sheryl freezes. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006        54. \nHe comes at Mike again, but... he eludes the attack. \nMike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach, and SWINGS, STRIKING THE CONCEALED FIGURE IN THE KNEE, he drops to the ground. \nThe Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall! \nSheryl's frozen in fear. \nCLYDE Oh my stars, what happened to you? \nSHERYL (Out of breath) You have to help me. I was kidnapped. My boyfriend came... And this man's chasing me. He's chasing me right now. \nCLYDE Calm down. I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying. \nSHERYL He's coming. He's right behind me. \nClyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but... all's peaceful at the moment. No Deacon. \nCLYDE Look, miss, there's no one there. \nSHERYL Oh my God, Mike. \nANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles Sheryl. Deacon steps into frame. Sickle/Axe in hand. He starts toward Clyde and Sheryl. \nCLYDE It's going to be fine, Miss. I promise you. Everything's going to be fine. \nSheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest. \nSHERYL'S POV - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing. \nSHERYL SCREAMS.   CLYDE HOLDS ONTO SHERYL. \nOff her look, Clyde turns... DEACON AND CLYDE STAND FACE TO FACE. The moment's frozen. For too long. \nSomething's not right. \nCLYDE Deacon, what's going on?    How the heck did she escape? \nSheryl looks at Clyde, in shock.    Deacon lowers his head, ashamed. \nCLYDE Want something done, gotta do it yourself. \nClyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt... Sheryl turns, about to run, when... CLYDE CRACKS HER ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \n70   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                   70 \nSHERYL'S POV - OUT OF FOCUS, WOBBLY. LIGHTS, a rainbow of FUZZY COLORS DANCE BEFORE US. Slowly, bring into focus... Sheryl coughs, gags on something. \nSHERYL'S POV - She lifts her arms to discover her wrists are tied together tightly. \nSHERYL'S POV - Ida enters the room carrying something. Sheryl's breath quickens. Ida walks right up to Sheryl.        She places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit. \nIDA Perfect. Just perfect. You are lovely as a summer's day. (Checks her watch) It's almost time. \nSheryl catches her REFLECTION in a small wall mirror. \n71   INT.   CHAPEL - DAY                                          71 \nANGLE ON - A ROPE looped through a hook in the ceiling. FOLLOW THE ROPE DOWN... PASS A PAIR OF BLOODY AND BRUISED HANDS, WRISTS... keep going... end on Mike. \nMike's passed out. He dangles in the middle of the room. He wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope gags his mouth. \nANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE.   As it moves towards Mike... \nDeacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye. \nAn eye for an eye? \nMike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but... \nCLYDE (O.S.) Deacon! \nClyde enters. He wears a long garment around his neck, carries a bible. \nCLYDE That's enough. Get him ready. \nDeacon backs off. He undoes a slipknot on the far wall, which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon lifts Mike to his feet, positions him. \nIt's only now Mike gets a gander at the room. \nThe FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and everywhere. \nAn old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's hollow, full of static and futz. \nMike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as... \nThe iron door slowly CREAKS open. \nANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time. \nShimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still bound. Her mouth gagged. \nCLYDE (Beat) How well do you know your bible, Michael? \nMIKE Jesus Fucking Christ... \nClyde SLAPS Mike across the face. \nCLYDE I told you before to watch that mouth, mister. \nMIKE Fuck you. \nClyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice.    He readies a third. \nCLYDE You through? \nMike spits some blood on the floor.    Nods. \nCLYDE I'll ask again... how well do you know the bible? \nMIKE Not very. \nCLYDE That's okay. It's fine. That's why I am here... teach you the way things are and the way they should be. \n73   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                   73 \nSheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM). \nIda pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair. Satisfied. \nIDA I'll be right back. \nIda exits the room. Deacon stands by the door.        He and Sheryl alone together. \nSheryl tries not to make eye contact. \nDeacon stares at her.     Longingly. \nDEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting with every breath. \nON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP \nDEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and lust in her eyes. \nSHERYL I want you, Deacon. (Jump Cut to...) I want you to fuck me.   Hard. \nON DEACON - His stare deepens. \nSheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place. Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries. \n74   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                      74 \nClyde sits in a chair next to Mike. \nCLYDE Lord knows the will of a man gets tested. Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. It's what makes a man, a man. Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles. Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment... Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. (Beat) Relations prior to marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes. And because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but... as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character. But you'll do it. Because that's what needs to be done. \nMike stares unflinching at Clyde. \n75   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                               75 \nDeacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't. \nANGLE ON - Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh. \nSheryl squirms, but that's all she can do.       Then... \nIDA (O.S.) Deacon! \nDeacon jumps up, backs off. \nIDA You get away from her.    Git!   Now! \nIda sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the room. She shuts the door behind him. \nIDA I'm sorry about that, Sugar.     My brother, he's not well. \nShe retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl. \nIDA It's not all his fault. Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals. Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken to him. What happened with the others won't happen to you. He's promised me that. \nWhat others?   What did he do? \nIDA I'm gonna take that out of your mouth now. I brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some rest. Okay? \nIda unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips... \nSHERYL Please don't do this. Please let me go. Please..I just want to go home. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT         OCTOBER 17, 2006             65. \nIda stares at Sheryl...    debating... \n91   INT.

This seems to bring Ida back from wherever she was, back to the matter at hand... \nIda looks into Sheryl's tear-filled eyes. \nIDA You can help...       by following the rules. \nIda CHOPS off Sheryl's pinky finger. Sheryl SCREAMS. \nANGLE ON - SHERYL'S PINKY FINGER HITS THE FLOOR. \n93   EXT.

He stares out, nervously watching. \nBrody, in his beat-up Pick-up truck, pulls to a stop.    Exits the truck, approaches Clyde. \nBRODY Clyde! \nCLYDE G'morning, Brody. \nBRODY I stopped by your place the other day. \nCLYDE Ida mentioned. \nBRODY So have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker? \nCLYDE (Beat) In fact I have. I saw him and his lady leave. \nBRODY When was this? \nCLYDE Yesterday.     Just before dusk. \nBRODY Bullshit. \nCLYDE Believe what you want. \nClyde looks out at the swamp, then back to Brody, who never stopped staring at Clyde. \nBRODY I saw their car last night in the parking lot at base. So they didn't leave, \"Just before dusk.\" \nCLYDE Well, I was down at base this morning... car's gone now. \nBRODY Something don't feel right here, Clyde. Between you and Ida... \nCLYDE I don't have time for this... \nHe starts to walk away, but Brody grabs his wrist tightly. \nCLYDE Take your hand off me, Brody. \nBRODY What do you know about that hiker you ain't telling me? \nBrody waits a beat, then lets him go. \nCLYDE I told you, Brody...    I saw them leave. Let it go. \nBrody watches Clyde head off. He's even more paranoid now than before. What Brody doesn't notice... \nANGLE ON THE SWAMP...

Clyde, it's Sam at base, come back. \nCLYDE Go for, Clyde. \nMike screams trying to be heard while Clyde has button pushed. \nCLYDE (To Deacon and Ida) Restrain him. \nDeacon holds Mike, while Ida grabs the gag. \nSAM (V.O.) Yeah, morning, Clyde. Got a missing person's report. Young Couple out of Alexandria. We're printing up some flyers with their photos right now. \nMIKE I told you.

A better one. \nMIKE, knife in hand, EXPLODES FROM TORTURE ROOM #2, RUNS STRAIGHT FOR IDA, but... \nIda SWINGS THE SHOVEL, KNOCKS MIKE'S LEGS OUT FROM UNDER HIM. He trips and falls to the floor. \nIda gets up, STOMPS DOWN ON MIKE'S HAND.   The knife drops. \nFROM THE HALLWAY... Sheryl looks out, watches as... \nBACK IN THE ROOM...   Ida grabs the knife, PLUNGES it deep into Mike's calf. \nIDA In for a penny, in for a pound. I can't save your soul now, Michael. I tried. I gave you a way to cleanse yourself of all your sins and deliver you to heaven... and how do you repay me? \nIda takes the knife, DAGGERS IT INTO MIKE'S THIGH. \nIDA BY KILLING MY CLYDE?!? \nSHERYL-- \nSpots the shovel on the floor, grabs it... \nIDA There is no soul blacker than yours. And now, by the grace of God, I must deliver you to Satan myself. \nIda retracts the blade, pulls herself on top of Mike.   Ready to stab again, when... \nSHERYL SLAMS THE SHOVEL OVER IDA'S HEAD. \nANGLE ON - THE SHOVEL BLADE sprayed with blood. \nIda falls over.   Sheryl and Mike stare at her lifeless body. \nSheryl steps over Ida's legs. She takes a big step, clears Ida's upper body...and stumbles. \nSheryl goes to Mike, wraps his arm around her, lifts him up. But just as his foot touches the ground... A SURGE OF PAIN CRIPPLES HIM. Mike falls back to the ground. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                OCTOBER 17, 2006      94. \nMIKE I can't make it. \nSHERYL I'm not leaving you. \nMIKE (Thinks) Clyde's walkie-talkie. It's probably upstairs. Find it. Call the Ranger base. (Remembers) My gun. See if you can find our stuff. My gun's in my backpack, side pocket. \nSHERYL What good's the gun?        You tossed away the bullets. \nMike turns away.   Guilt etched on his face. \nMIKE There's another box of ammo. \nSHERYL Mike...!?! \nMIKE Let's get out of this alive first, then you can bitch me out, okay? \nSheryl concedes.   She goes to the ladder, stops... turns. \nMike looks at her.   They stare at one another. \nMIKE It's okay, baby.      Go. \nSheryl turns, ascends the ladder. \n128   INT.

She finds the wound, but has nothing to stop the blood. \nSHERYL You did it, baby. You saved me. You said you would and you did. Stay with me, Mike. Stay with me. \nMIKE (Barely audible) Love you. \nSHERYL Well, if you love me... Fight.    Please baby, fight. \nShe looks around wildly, spying...

She glares right back. Brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him. \nIDA What'd he do you for anyway? \nBRODY He busted Darryl's face in with a shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and teeth. Nearly killed him. (Beat) You spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me. \nIDA Fine. \nBrody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove. \nIDA He's gone. Brody and those boys are a pain in the backside. I'm sure that cousin of his had it coming. \nIda leads Mike back to the couch. \nMIKE What did the Ranger say? Does he need to speak to me? When is he coming? \nIda heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot water into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water. \nIDA Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone. \nIda stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike. \nMIKE God damnit! \nIda pauses...then: \nIDA Please don't take the Lord's name in vain in this house. \nShe GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until... \nMIKE I'm sorry. \nIDA Drink this. \nIda hands him the steaming mug.    Mike's mind races. \nMIKE Something's not right. \nIDA I'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute. We'll try them again and we'll find Sheryl. You'll see. She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of \"don't know where.\" Happens lots of times. (Looks to the mug) Please drink up, Michael, it will make you feel better. \nMike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his lips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him. \nUnnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping. \nIDA What's wrong? \nMIKE How did you know my name? \nIDA (Confused) Excuse me? \nMIKE Michael. You keep calling me Michael. You did it just now. You did before, just after I woke up. You called me Michael. Nobody calls me Michael. \nIDA I'm sure you're mistaken.    You musta told me before. \nMIKE No, I would have told you \"Mike.\" Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me Michael. \nIDA Well, how else could I have known your name? \nANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006    49. \nMIKE (Beat; thinks...)

I saved your life. Twice. Why would I steal your wallet? (Mike doesn't respond) Now, just drink your primrose... \nMIKE Fuck the primrose! \nMike TOSSES the mug across the room.      It SHATTERS. \nMike lifts himself up.

The poker falls to the floor. \nIda JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat. \nMike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against the wall.

He pulls the rug out... \nREVEAL: A TRAP DOOR.   Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open. \n59   INT.   TRAP DOOR STAIRCASE                                    59 \nFROM BELOW...

He flips it ON. \nSounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable. Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of the hallway. \nMike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards the doors. \nJust as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike.

How do you expect... \nCLYDE Clearly you did not understand. You did not even attempt relations last evening. \nMIKE What you're asking to do is sick.

Vomit splashed down his body. \nClyde and Ida look to one another... \nCLYDE What was that? \n108   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                108 \nDeacon slaps his left hand over her mouth, climbs on top of Sheryl using his weight to keep her in place. Deacon positions himself for penetration, when... \nSheryl SCREAMS, but Deacon's hand muffles the cries. \nWith every ounce of strength left inside her, SHERYL BITES DOWN ON DEACON'S HAND. He SCREAMS, falling off of her. \nCLOSE ON DEACON'S HAND - blood oozes, a large piece looks ripped out. \nSheryl SPITS the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth. \nDeacon grabs the SICKLE/AXE, starts towards Sheryl... \nAt the top of her lungs, SHERYL LETS LOOSE A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM! And... \nIda bursts in the room... \nIDA Deacon!   Stop right there! \n", "test3_true": "IDA Out!   Get out! \nDeacon slinks away. Sheryl curls up in a ball, emotions consume her. She breaks down. \n109   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - SUNSET                                 109 \nThe Sun sinks on the horizon... \n110   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                      110 \nSheryl's tied, once again, to the table. Mike tied to a chair, which is dragged into the room by Clyde. \nSheryl sees Mike's burned chest. \nCLYDE This is getting out of hand, y'all. Nobody wanted what just almost happened to Sheryl to happen. But, you keep dragging this thing out... things are gonna... happen. \nIDA I sent Deacon away for a bit. He knows he done wrong. You say right now that you are ready to perform your marital duties, then I'll keep him away. \nMIKE Have you ever thought that God doesn't want you to have a child? That's why he fucking kills them before they're born. Because you're fucking insane monsters that don't deserve a child. \nIda SLAPS Mike. \nIDA You take that back! \nMIKE No. \nIDA Take it back. \nIda digs her hand into Mike's bear trap wound, squeezes.    But Mike doesn't scream or squirm. He endures the pain. \nMIKE Go ahead and torture me. There's absolutely no way I would ever give a child of mine to you. \nIDA How very brave. Fine. I won't torture you. (Looks to Sheryl) I'll torture her. I can bring back Deacon. Let him have her. Plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can't be made. \nIda grabs a nearby knife, walks up to Sheryl. \nIDA Or maybe we can just start dicing. All we need is a healthy heart, brain and uterus. She don't need the rest of her fingers, or toes... or her nose, ears. I could carve out her eye right now. \nIda places the knife on top of Sheryl's cheek, just below the eye. The tip just centimeters away from the eyeball. \nMIKE No! \nIda takes the knife away, gets in Mike's face... \nIDA Then you will give me my baby. My child, born in wedlock, saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear God and give him praise. \nSheryl starts LAUGHING. Inappropriate, but nonetheless, She's cracking up. Has she finally cracked? \nSHERYL That's why you married us? So we could conceive our child in wedlock? The fucking joke's on you... I'm already pregnant. Eight weeks yesterday. \nClyde and Ida stare disbelievingly at Sheryl. \nIDA You're lying. \nMike stares in shock at Sheryl. \nIn that look, Ida knows Sheryl's telling the truth. \nSHERYL I was trying to find the right time to tell you. \nTEARS fill both their eyes. \nIDA No, no, no, no!    This can't be.   NO! \nClyde grabs hold of Ida, tries to calm her down.        When... \nOFF SCREEN: A GLASS BREAKS.    It came from upstairs. \nIDA AND CLYDE SPRING INTO ACTION.     They exit the room, BOLT THE DOOR LOCKED. \nMIKE'S POV - THE POCKET KNIFE still on the floor. \n111   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                        111 \nBrody and Lonnie stand on the porch.      Brody holds a shotgun, Lonnie a rifle. \nBrody reaches inside the broken window, unlocks it. \nLONNIE We shouldn't just go in.      Ain't right. \nBrody slides open the window. \nBRODY I'm going in. You don't want to, then don't. Check round back or something. \nBrody climbs inside.     Lonnie heads around the back. \n", "test3_id": 2783}

{"test1_input": "Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow.      He freezes, completely floored. \nEverything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits, everything. Even the fire pit. \nMike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless. \nHe SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells.       He closes it, heads back into the woods. \n53   OMIT                                                              53 \n54   EXT.

A FEW BLOOD DROPS OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the blood. What the fuck? \nA couple more DROPS hit him.    Mike LOOKS UP... \nA MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by coarse thick ropes. \nMike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware...       A FEW FEET BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP. \nMike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer... his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP... \nSNAP! CRUNCH!    MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN ON HIS LEG! \nMike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel. \nMIKE HELP!?!?! \nMike writhes in pain on the ground.    His eyes watering.     The pain UNBEARABLE. Then... \nMIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden. \nMike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then... \nIda bends down next to Mike. \nIDA Michael, can you hear me?    Michael... \nHer words fade out.    He promptly PASSES OUT. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS. \nFADE IN: \n55   INT.

A glance around... \nGaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT. \nMike's memory slowly comes back.    He leans up when... \nMIKE Ow! \nA sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced the Gray Bandana on his arm. \nIda enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen. She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops. \nIDA Look who's up. \nMIKE Where am I? \nIDA You're in my home, Michael. You gave me quite a scare. I thought I lost you. \nIda grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and walks back to Mike. \nIDA Lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it. I know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing. That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I'll get some \"evening primrose\" in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well... just about everything. So's do I. \nIda unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound. \nIDA Try and relax. \nIda cleans the wound.    Mike winces.   He can't watch. \nMIKE Thank you.     For saving my life. \nIDA You don't have to thank me. Up here, we take care of one another. That's the only way any of us survive. \nMIKE Um... (Thinks...)

It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody. \nMIKE Ida, I need some help. \nIDA I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie. \nMIKE No, not me. It's Sheryl. My girlfriend. You met her with me yesterday. Something's happened to her. She was gone this morning when I woke up. I looked everywhere and I couldn't find her. We need to call someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We need to find her right away. Do you have a phone? \nIDA I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really had use for one. (Beat) I do have a radio. We can call down to base if you'd like. \nIda comes back to the couch. \nIDA After we take care of you. \nMIKE I'm fine, Ida, please... if you could call now. \nIDA You want to lose this leg? Cause that's what you're risking. Soon as we're done, I'll call. Okay? \nMike concedes.   Ida hands a second rag to Mike. \nIDA Bite down on this... I ain't gonna lie... Lotta pain about to hit you sweetheart. \nMike puts the rag in his mouth. Ida dips the used cloth in the moonshine. He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies the moonshine to the wound. \nMike SCREAMS through the cloth. \nIDA It's okay.     It's almost over. \nIda repeats. Mike SCREAMS again. His eyes water. \nIda offers her palm.    Mike opens his mouth.   The cloth falls into her hand. \nMike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain. \nIda crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths and grabs a larger towel. She walks back to Mike and wraps his calf with the towel. \nIDA We'll get some of that primrose in you and you'll be good as new. \nMIKE Ida? The radio. Please... Can you call down please? \nIDA I'll take care of it right now. \nIda heads to a closed door on the far side of the room.    She opens and enters, sure to close the door behind her. \nMike relaxes, as best he can anyway.    Until... \nKNOCK, KNOCK. \nBRODY (OS) Ida, you in there?! \nMIKE'S POV - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits outside. \nIda exits the room, heads for the door. \nMIKE (Whispers) He's looking for me. \nIDA (Whispers; concerned) Why's that? \nBRODY (OS) Ida! \nMIKE (Whispers) I think he had something to do with Sheryl going missing. \nKNOCK, KNOCK. \nIDA (Whispers) I'll take care of it. \nBRODY (OS) Ida, lemme in! \nIDA I'm coming! \nIda helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove. He winces all the way. She leans him up against the near wall so that he is out of view of the door. \nIda goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an agitated Brody, shotgun in hand. \nSuspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin.    She doesn't budge. \nBRODY What took you so long? \nIDA What do you want, Brody? \nBRODY I'm looking for a man hiker. \nIDA This \"man hiker\" alone or wit someone? \nBRODY He had a lady friend, but...    I'm just looking for him now. \n", "test1_id": 2781, "test2_input": "ON MIKE - Listening nervously. \nIDA Well, I ain't seen no one in days. \nBrody glares at her. She glares right back. Brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him. \nIDA What'd he do you for anyway? \nBRODY He busted Darryl's face in with a shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and teeth. Nearly killed him. (Beat) You spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me. \nIDA Fine. \nBrody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove. \nIDA He's gone. Brody and those boys are a pain in the backside. I'm sure that cousin of his had it coming. \nIda leads Mike back to the couch. \nMIKE What did the Ranger say? Does he need to speak to me? When is he coming? \nIda heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot water into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water. \nIDA Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone. \nIda stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike. \nMIKE God damnit! \nIda pauses...then: \nIDA Please don't take the Lord's name in vain in this house. \nShe GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until... \nMIKE I'm sorry. \nIDA Drink this. \nIda hands him the steaming mug.    Mike's mind races. \nMIKE Something's not right. \nIDA I'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute. We'll try them again and we'll find Sheryl. You'll see. She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of \"don't know where.\" Happens lots of times. (Looks to the mug) Please drink up, Michael, it will make you feel better. \nMike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his lips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him. \nUnnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping. \nIDA What's wrong? \nMIKE How did you know my name? \nIDA (Confused) Excuse me? \nMIKE Michael. You keep calling me Michael. You did it just now. You did before, just after I woke up. You called me Michael. Nobody calls me Michael. \nIDA I'm sure you're mistaken.    You musta told me before. \nMIKE No, I would have told you \"Mike.\" Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me Michael. \nIDA Well, how else could I have known your name? \nANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006    49. \nMIKE (Beat; thinks...) On my driver's license and credit cards, it says Michael. If you stole my wallet from the campsite... that's how you'd have known. \nLong beat. \nIDA You're accusing me of stealing your wallet? I saved your life. Twice. Why would I steal your wallet? (Mike doesn't respond) Now, just drink your primrose... \nMIKE Fuck the primrose! \nMike TOSSES the mug across the room.      It SHATTERS. \nMike lifts himself up. Despite the pain, he heads for the room Ida went in to make the radio call. \nIDA Where do you think you're going? \nMIKE I want to call the Ranger myself. \nIDA NO! \nIda springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike. \nMIKE I'm getting in that room, Ida. \n", "test2_true": "IDA I can't let you in there. \nMike takes a step forward.

The poker falls to the floor. \nIda JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat. \nMike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against the wall. The two fall to the floor. \nMike pushes himself up, but before he can get away... \nIDA GRABS HOLD OF HIS BEAR TRAP WOUND, SQUEEZES! \nMIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY! Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the face, boot to nose. Ida's head snaps back, then falls face first on the floorboard. \nMike is PANTING, glances at Ida.    She's out cold. \nMike pushes himself up, limps to the door.      He grabs the handle, PUSHES IT OPEN... \n58   INT.

He steps over to the radio, when he notices... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006       51. \nAN INCH THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE RADIO. He swipes it with his finger. This thing hasn't been used in years. \nMike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the floor... HIS FOOT SINKS a little. Mike tests the floor board again. It's RICKETY. He pulls the rug out... \nREVEAL: A TRAP DOOR.   Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open. \n59   INT.   TRAP DOOR STAIRCASE                                    59 \nFROM BELOW...

NINE LARGE GLASS JARS FILLED WITH LIQUID... \nINSIDE EACH JAR - HUMAN FETUSES, all in various stages of development and DEFORMITY. Each jar is labelled with their own individual bronze nameplate (#1, MATTHEW... #2, JOHN... #3, PETER... #4, LUKE, etc...). \nTHE LAST JAR - The fetus is closest to term, maybe 8 months along). The nameplate reads, \"TIMOTHY.\" \nMike, completely freaked out, backpedals, bumps into AN IRON DOOR. He turns the handle, opens it... \n61   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         61 \nIt's pitch black as Mike opens the door.   Next to the door, a light switch... He flips it ON. \nSounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable. Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of the hallway. \nMike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards the doors. \nJust as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike. As he brushes himself off. \n", "test2_id": 2782, "test3_input": "CLYDE (Beat) How well do you know your bible, Michael? \nMIKE Jesus Fucking Christ... \nClyde SLAPS Mike across the face. \nCLYDE I told you before to watch that mouth, mister. \nMIKE Fuck you. \nClyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice.

TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                   73 \nSheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM). \nIda pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair. Satisfied. \nIDA I'll be right back. \nIda exits the room. Deacon stands by the door.        He and Sheryl alone together. \nSheryl tries not to make eye contact. \nDeacon stares at her.     Longingly. \nDEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting with every breath. \nON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP \nDEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and lust in her eyes. \nSHERYL I want you, Deacon. (Jump Cut to...) I want you to fuck me.   Hard. \nON DEACON - His stare deepens. \nSheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place. Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries. \n74   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                      74 \nClyde sits in a chair next to Mike. \nCLYDE Lord knows the will of a man gets tested. Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. It's what makes a man, a man. Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles. Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment... Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. (Beat) Relations prior to marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes. And because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but... as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character. But you'll do it. Because that's what needs to be done. \nMike stares unflinching at Clyde. \n75   INT.

Then... \nIDA (O.S.) Deacon! \nDeacon jumps up, backs off. \nIDA You get away from her.    Git!   Now! \nIda sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the room. She shuts the door behind him. \nIDA I'm sorry about that, Sugar.     My brother, he's not well. \nShe retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl. \nIDA It's not all his fault. Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals. Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken to him. What happened with the others won't happen to you. He's promised me that. \nWhat others?   What did he do? \nIDA I'm gonna take that out of your mouth now. I brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some rest. Okay? \nIda unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips... \nSHERYL Please don't do this. Please let me go.

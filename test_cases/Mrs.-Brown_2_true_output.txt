INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
The next day. 
QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated. 
DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely. 
And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern. 
VICTORIA How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans? If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage.  No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are.  It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation. 
A beat. A nervous silence in the Household. 
DISRAELI Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen. (beat) You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens. 
VICTORIA But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli. 
VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back. 
DISRAELI Of course I understand your concern. You miss your people. (a pause) And they miss you. 
VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism. 
VICTORIA Then they may read about me. 
DISRAELI Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful. 
VICTORIA Is that not enough? 
DISRAELI In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead. 
VICTORIA has the measure of him. 
VICTORIA I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief. 
DISRAELI Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it. 
The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart. 
VICTORIA I stay here because I am happy. (beat) Is that such a terrible crime? 
DISRAELI No, ma'am. 
At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in. 
BROWN Time for your walk. 
Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops. 
VICTORIA This is my good John Brown. 
DISRAELI (taking him in) Yes. 
VICTORIA I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral. 
BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously. 
BROWN What brings you here?

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight... The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a few inches lower than Merrill's reach. 
GRAHAM Let go. 
Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic. 
Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door. 
After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat. 
It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a THUD. 
The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. THUD. 
The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright. 
Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING 
THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE. 
Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON THE DOOR. 
THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR UPSTAIRS. 
Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs. 
ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING 
The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he enters the kitchen. 
Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door. 
They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and jam the rest underneath the table. 
Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at the pile of furniture. 
MERRILL This is going to do nothing. 
GRAHAM We have to go in the basement. 
Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom. 
MERRILL There's no way out of there. 
Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children. 
GRAHAM Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? 
THUD. 
MERRILL Should we make a run for it out the back? 
GRAHAM They're right behind the door. 
Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall. 
GRAHAM He was only a year and half old. 
MERRILL (to Graham) What are you doing? 
GRAHAM He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.  Your grandma said, "No."  He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. 
THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen. 
GRAHAM I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle.  His elbow popped right out of the socket. 
THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL. 
WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS. 
GRAHAM He didn't scream or anything.  His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still. 
MERRILL They're coming.

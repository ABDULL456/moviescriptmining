NURSE If you'll wait Just a minute I'll get everything from the business office.

He wanders to the waiting area. GLENN has been looking out the window at BARBARA JEAN getting into the bus. He comes back and begins to talk to GREEN so caught up in her he doesn't register GREEN'S grief. 
GLENN (loudly) My mamma used to know her... They lived next door to each other... she said she was always nursing the sick animals. 
GREEN looks at him and nods. He's still got the vitamins in his hand. 
GLENN I really learned all about her from my Momma -- She's been saving this scrap book about her since she got to be famous. 
GREEN nods. 
GLENN The one thing she said to me when I joined was "When you're doing your travels you be sure you see Barbara Jean. You don't have to say anything about me but you be sure you see her."  So that's what I've been doing. Now I'm going to hitch a ride so I can see her in Memphis. 
GREEN nods. 
GLENN You give my test to your wife1 
GREEN nods and puts the vitamins in his pocket as the NURSE calls from the desk. 
NURSE Mr. Green, the doctor is on his way and the business office has your bill ready.

He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at Preston. 
107   EXT. SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION                        107 
Regula, the dead planet beyond. 
108   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE                                    108 
Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab. 
109   INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE                                   109 
Battle damage, some repaired, some not. The bridge is filled with tension, all hands at station. 
SULU (V.O.) Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I. 
KIRK Try again. 
UHURA Space Station Regular I, this is Starship Enterprise. Come in, please... 
110   INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR  I - CAROL'S LAB - ON SCREEN    110 
As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response. 
UHURA I say again. Space Station Regular. This is Starship Enterprise. Please respond. Please respond. 
During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni- cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening. Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone a warning. 
111   BACK TO BRIDGE                                             111 
UHURA ... No response, sir. 
KIRK Sensors, Captain? 
SPOCK Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station. 
KIRK And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area... 
SPOCK Affirmative, Admiral. 
KIRK (with irony) ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond? 
SPOCK Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space. 
KIRK Reliant could be hiding behind that rock. 
SPOCK A distinct possibility. 
KIRK Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters? 
SCOTTY'S VOICE Just barely, sir. 
KIRK (the decision) I'm going down to the station. 
He starts out. Bones stops him. 
BONES Khan could be down there! 
KIRK He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt. 
BONES I can spare me... 
SAAVIK Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.' 
KIRK There is no such regulation. 
Saavik's gaze falters -- 
KIRK (continuing) All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours. 
SPOCK Aye sir -- 
KIRK Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott. 
SPOCK Be careful, Jim... 
Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors. 
112   EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I                       112 
CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous. 
113   INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB                 113 
empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators and tricorders.

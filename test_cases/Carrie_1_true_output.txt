CARRIE I don't even know how to... 
TOMMY It's easy. 
And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him. 
CARRIE Tommy... why? 
TOMMY Why what? 
CARRIE Why am I here? 
TOMMY It's the prom. 
CARRIE With you. 
TOMMY Because I asked you. And... 
CARRIE Why? Why did you? 
TOMMY Because I wanted to. 
CARRIE Why? 
TOMMY Because... 
He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back. 
TOMMY ...you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did. 
CARRIE Oh. 
She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else. 
TOMMY (quickly) Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together... and I like it, you know... I mean, I... 
CARRIE But... 
A commotion from the floor. 
Tommy turns. 
TOMMY Hey, look! 
Carrie looks off, following his glance, at: 
191 STAGE AREA ­ POV 
As the head Custodian supervises the sliding of two thrones from the wings onto pre-set marks on the stage apron. They're sheathed in white ­ strewn with crepe papers and flowers to match the prom's celestial theme. 
192 CARRIE AND TOMMY 
CARRIE (uneasily) It's a fairy tale. 
TOMMY (beaming; taking her arm) C'mon. 
He starts to lead her towards their table while: 
CUT TO: 
193 EXT. SCHOOL ­ STREET ­ NIGHT 
Sue Snell ­ unable to contain her curiosity about how all this has worked out ­ pulls up in one of her parents' cars, parks, and deliberates coming in. The lights of the gymnasium are glowing. While inside: 
194 INT. GYM ­ STAGE AREA 
Class president Ernest Peterson makes his way to the microphone. He takes all this quite seriously. 
ERNEST All right, ladies and gentlemen. Take your seats, please ­ it's time for the voting. 
NORMA This contest is an insult to women! 
A couple of CHEERS, scattered APPLAUSE. 
GEORGE It insults men, too! 
Louder CLAPPING, foot STOMPING, WHISTLES. 
ERNEST (over the noise) Please take your seats. It's time to vote for the King and Queen. 
Several ushers go up and down the aisles, passing out ballots. 
195 ANGLE ­ TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLE 
as Norma Watson haughtily drops a ballot on their table in front of Tommy, another in front of George. 
Carrie examines the paper. 
CARRIE Tommy... (looking up to see him smiling at her) ...we're on here! 
TOMMY I know. (seeing her concern) Want to decline? 
CARRIE Do you want to? 
TOMMY Hell, no. If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance. And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.

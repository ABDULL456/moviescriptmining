Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. Emil slides into the cab. 
CABBIE Where you wanna go, buddy? 
Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the return address on it and passes it through the slot to the Cabbie. 
EMIL Here. 
Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole. 
EMIL (CONT'D) Go! 
Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil. 
EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY 
Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out. 
HAWKINS So what's unique? 
EDDIE Not what.  Who. 
Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed - covered in blood. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle. 
HAWKINS That's unique. 
EDDIE Yeah.  And he still went to the party. 
Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty. 
LOOKOUT Top floor.  Back room. 
EDDIE Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the news and I look good.  But the problem with becoming a star is downtown.  They shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh. 
As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. Waves them off.  They hurry away. 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me. 
HAWKINS You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched. 
Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend the fire escape. 
HAWKINS (CONT'D) Ready? 
EDDIE Keep them out of my way. 
HAWKINS Okay.  You ready? 
EDDIE Yeah, yeah.  Jesus. 
Eddie closes in. 
HAWKINS (into his cell phone) COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS, LET'S MOVE IT! 
Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where he lands dropping his gun. 
Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up. 
EDDIE What's your rush?  Going to a party? 
UNIQUE Why you chasin' me, man? 
EDDIE I don't know.  You always come outta your house that way? 
UNIQUE It's not my house, man.  I don't live here. 
EDDIE Well, sounds like burglary to me. 
Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie. 
UNIQUE I know you man. 
An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust. 
HAWKINS (to Eddie) Any chance we can do that again? 
EDDIE Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.

CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) There's Control himself, you behind him, as usual... 
A younger bespectacled Smiley, lost amongst his more glamorous colleagues. She traces other faces with a crooked finger. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) (Fondly) Jim Prideaux... and Bill Haydon. Together of course. The Inseparables. All my boys. That was a good time, George. 
SMILEY (Chiding) It was the war, Connie. 
CONNIE SACHS A real war. Englishmen could be proud then. 
She stares at the photograph with a sad smile. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I was right, then? About Polyakov. There's a mole? 
Smiley doesn't answer, stands up to go. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were. 
76   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                      76 
The house we saw in the title sequence. The air duct opens on the front of the house, spilling out its star-shape of light. 
After a moment Polyakov walks up to the door and knocks. We hear the dog barking... 
77   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       77 
Mrs McCraig opens the door for him and he passes her with a smile, heading upstairs. 
We TRACK with Mrs McCraig as she walks back to her pantry, opens a cupboard to reveal a huge reel to reel TAPE RECORDER. With ancient fingers she presses down the clunky record button and the spools begin to revolve. 
POLYAKOV (O.S.) (In Russian) ... The Priest is surprised to see General Secretary Krushchev... 
78   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       78 
As we saw it in the titles. The Mystery Man sits at the table holding up pages of a document for Polyakov who is photographing them as he talks, the camera giving a satisfying CLICK and WHIR with each shot. 
POLYAKOV ... He says "Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls." The Priest says "That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary..." 
HIGH ANGLE - the dusty candelabra above their heads, and the tint MICROPHONE, nestled beside one of the bulbs. 
POLYAKOV (CONT'D) "... why are you telling me?" 
79   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       79 
... spools churning silently. 
POLYAKOV (O.S.) ... Krushchev says "I'm seventy- seven, I'm telling everyone." 
We hear his chuckle and the continued CLICK WHIR of the camera. 
80   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     80 
Smiley sits at his desk staring at the CHESS SET laid out before him. One of the pieces has had the photograph of POLYAKOV added to it. 
He begins to register the faint noises around him... Pigeons on the ledge outside the window, the television mast creaking on the roof above him... 
He hears footsteps approaching down the corridor and stop outside his room. He crosses to the door and opens it and finds CONTROL waiting for him. 
CONTROL Step into my lair. 
And in an instant we are in... 
81   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - PAST                  81 
Control is at the HEAD OF THE TABLE. Ranged against him are PERCY ALLELINE, ROY BLAND and TOBY ESTERHASE- all a little nervous. BILL HAYDON sits to the side, feet up. Smiley joins them without his spectacles. Control throws him a FILE. 
CONTROL (To Smiley) Sit down and take a look at this nonsense. 
Smiley sits down and begins to read. 
CONTROL (CONT'D) Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on. 
SMILEY (Engrossed) Where did you get it? 
CONTROL I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it. 
TOBY ESTERHASE (Protesting "cabal") Control... 
CONTROL Shut up, Esterhase. 
Control waves him down. Smiley considers the report dispassionately. 
SMILEY If it's genuine it's gold-dust. (Beat) But its topicality makes it suspect. 
Control turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile. 
CONTROL Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake. 
SMILEY Where does it come from? What's the access?

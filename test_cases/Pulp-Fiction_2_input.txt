WINSTON (painfully) It's your future: I see... a cab ride. (dropping the act) Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. (to Raquel) Say goodbye, Raquel. 
RAQUEL Goodbye, Raquel. 
WINSTON I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids. 
Winston turns to leave. 
JULES Mr. Wolf. 
He turns around. 
JULES I was a pleasure watchin' you work. 
The Wolf smiles. 
WINSTON Call me Winston. 
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche. 
WINSTON You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character. 
RAQUEL I have character. 
WINSTON Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character. 
RAQUEL Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny. 
The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road. 
The two men left alone look at each other. 
JULES Wanna share a cab? 
VINCENT You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me? 
JULES Sure. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP Â– MORNING 
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men, 
VINCENT Thanks a bunch. (to Jules, who's nursing his coffee) Want a sausage? 
JULES Naw, I don't eat pork. 
VINCENT Are you Jewish? 
JULES I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine. 
VINCENT Why not? 
JULES They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals. 
VINCENT Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good. 
JULES A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces. 
VINCENT How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces. 
JULES I don't eat dog either. 
VINCENT Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal? 
JULES I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way. 
VINCENT So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal? 
JULES We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs. 
The two men laugh. 
VINCENT Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet. 
JULES I just been sittin' here thinkin'. 
VINCENT (mouthful of food) About what? 
JULES The miracle we witnessed. 
VINCENT The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence. 
JULES Do you know that a miracle is? 
VINCENT An act of God. 
JULES What's an act of God? 
VINCENT I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies. 
JULES Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved. 
VINCENT But why? 
JULES That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep. 
VINCENT So you're serious, you're really gonna quit? 
JULES The life, most definitely. 
Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

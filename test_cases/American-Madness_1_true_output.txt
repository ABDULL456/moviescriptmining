DICKSON 
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years? 
(he looks around - silence) 
I'll tell you. Not a single one! 
(defiantly) 
What's wrong with that kind of banking? 
CLARK 
(mumbles disdainfully) 
Just pure luck! 
64. CLOSE SHOT 
Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks up: 
AMES 
Conditions have changed. These are precarious times. Banks today have got to be careful. And you've been more liberal than ever. 
Dickson's voice comes in over scene: 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
Yes, and I'm going to continue to be liberal . . . 
65. CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
As he continues: 
DICKSON 
The trouble with this country today is there's too much hoarded cash. Idle money is no good to industry. Where is all the money today? In the banks, vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried in the ground! I tell you, we've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity. 
66. CLOSE SHOT - CLARK 
CLARK 
Who are we going to give it to? Men like Jones? Last week you made him an extra loan of fifty thousand dollars. Do you call that intelligent banking? 
67. CLOSE SHOT - SCHULTZ AND DICKSON 
SCHULTZ 
He can't pay his bills. How do you expect him to pay us? 
DICKSON 
That's a fair question, Schultz. Now let's see how bad a risk Jones is. What's his history? He's been a successful business man for thirty-five years. Two years ago business started falling off. Today Jones needs money, and if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws nine hundred men out of work. Answer - unemployment. 
68. CLOSEUP - O'BRIEN 
As he listens intently, Dickson's voice coming in: 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
It also means his creditors aren't paid. They're in trouble. They go to banks and are turned down . . . more bankruptcies 
69. CLOSEUP - DICKSON 
As he continues: 
DICKSON 
It's a vicious circle, my friends, and the only place to cure it is right here at the source. Help Jones and you help the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes to me, I ask myself two questions. First - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he as good a business man as he was before? And the answer is - he's better . 
70. CLOSEUP - CLARK 
Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's speech comes over scene: 
DICKSON'S VOICE 
He is not only older and wiser, but his present trouble has taught him precaution. In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is no risk. Neither are the thousands of other Joneses throughout the country 
71. CLOSEUP - SCHULTZ 
To intercut with Dickson's speech. 
72. CLOSEUP - AMES 
To intercut with Dickson's speech. 
73. CLOSEUP - IVES 
To intercut with Dickson's speech. 
74. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The group, as Dickson concludes his speech. 
DICKSON 
It's they who built this nation up to the richest in the world, and it's up to the banks to give them a break. Disraeli said security is the prosperity of the nation[4] 
AMES 
(cutting him off) 
Why, Disraeli didn't say anything of the kind. 
DICKSON 
Well, he should have said it. It's as true now as it was then. And let us get the right kind of security. Not stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and down, not collateral on paper, but character! 
CLARK 
(indignantly) 
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea? 
DICKSON 
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character! It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums. 
CUT TO: 
75. INT. CLUETT'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn, panic-stricken. He is like an animal at bay. The leader of the trio, Dude Finlay, sits in a chair directly in front of Cluett. The other two men stand on either side of the desk. 
DUDE 
(menacingly) 
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you? 
CLUETT 
(trembling) 
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely! 
DUDE 
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us. 
CLUETT 
(helplessly) 
I haven't got it. 
76. CLOSE SHOT - DUDE 
Shooting past Cluett. 
DUDE 
(barking) 
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough. 
CLUETT 
I'm sorry, Dude, butI 
DUDE 
That don't do us any good. 
CLUETT 
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.

INT. GAIL'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY 
The door swings open to reveal the kitchen. Gail, her Father, and Mother are seated around the table, eating breakfast. They look towards Spud, who carries the knotted bundle of sheets as he approaches the table. GAIL 
Good morning, Spud. 
SPUD 
Morning, Gail. Morning, Mrs. Houston, Mr. Houston. 
MOTHER 
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast. 
SPUD 
Sorry about last night - 
GAIL 
It's all right. I slept fine on the sofa. 
SPUD 
I had a little too much to drink. I'm afraid I had a slight accident. 
FATHER 
Oh, don't worry, these things happen. It does everyone good to cut loose once in a while. 
GAIL 
This one could do with being tied up once in a while. 
MOTHER 
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now. 
SPUD 
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back. 
MOTHER 
There's no need. 
SPUD 
It's no problem. 
MOTHER 
No problem for me either. 
MOTHER 
Honestly, it's no problem. 
SPUD 
I'd really rather take care of it myself. 
MOTHER 
Spud, they're my sheets. 
She takes hold of the bundle. 
Spud does not yield. 
She pulls harder. Spud holds on. She tugs powerfully. 
The bundle bursts open with an explosion of vomit and excrement that covers everything in the kitchen. 
Only Spud remains untouched.

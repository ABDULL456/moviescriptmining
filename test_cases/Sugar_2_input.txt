MIGUEL One room. 
NIKOLAI For how long? 
MIGUEL I don't know. 
NIKOLAI Two hundred a week.   First week in advance. 
As Miguel tries to piece together what was just said, he notices a rack of condoms beside a set of long distance calling cards on the front desk. The name of the calling card is ALÓ MAMÁ!

Miguel glances around at the various wooden furniture items for sale. 
MIGUEL I like your work. 
OSVALDO Thanks.    What are you looking for? 
MIGUEL Oh, no, I mean... I don't know. I was passing by and thought maybe you might need some help. I know how to make furniture, and-- 
OSVALDO --I don't have any work right now. Sorry. 
MIGUEL Right.    Okay, thanks for your time. 
Osvaldo gets back to his computer, but Miguel lingers...

OSVALDO Have you checked the classifieds?

HICCUP I suppose there is that... (feeble, trailing off) ... one... specific... thing... 
Excited dragons rush up to greet Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him. 
VALKA Do you like it? 
HICCUP I don't have the words. 
Toothless SNARLS in annoyance as the curious, smothering dragons SNIFF every part of him. 
VALKA Can I... ? He's beautiful! 
She reaches out to stroke Toothless, who PURRS at her touch. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Incredible. He might very well be the last of his kind. 
She inspects his talons as Toothless rolls onto his back, nuzzling her. 
VALKA (CONT'D) And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well. 
Hiccup smiles, astounded by Toothless' affection for Valka. She checks his teeth. They recede into the gums at her touch. 
VALKA (CONT'D) And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to-- 
HICCUP --I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded. 
She winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to caress a few of her own rescued dragons. 
VALKA This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared. (re: Toothless' tail) And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too? 
HICCUP Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down. 
She glares, confused. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) It's okay though. He got me back. (playfully, to Toothless) Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So... peg leg! 
Hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. Valka observes their playful rapport with curiosity. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 42. 
VALKA What did your father think of your Night Fury friend? 
HICCUP He didn't take it all that well. 
She mutters in agreement. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own. 
She smiles at Toothless, dismissive. 
VALKA If only it were possible. 
HICCUP No, really, I -- 
VALKA -- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different. 
EXT. BERK VILLAGE - NIGHT 
FLASHBACK 
Dragons sweep from the sky, blowing FIRE, carrying off sheep and dried fish. Vikings chase them down, hurling weapons. 
VALKA (V.O.) Berk was a land of kill or be killed, but I believed peace was possible. 
A Viking is about to finish off a felled dragon, but Valka chases up to him and tugs at his arm. 
VALKA Stop! You'll only make it worse! 
The dragon takes wing, escaping to safety... leaving the Viking warrior glaring at Valka. 
VALKA (V.O.) It was a very unpopular opinion. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 43. 
As he rushes off, Valka hears a clatter and whirls around to see a DRAGON (Cloudjumper) clawing its way through the roof of a house. 
VALKA Hiccup!

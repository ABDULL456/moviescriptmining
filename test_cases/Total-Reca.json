{"test1_input": "QUAIL I don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake.  I won't really have gone.  I won't really.... \nMcCLANE (kind but firm) Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for EIO.  This - REKALL - is the only way to achieve your dream. \nHe gets up and walks around to Quail's chair. \nMcCLANE (continuing) Think about it, Douglas. Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories. \nQuail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced. \n9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nQuail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on TV.  She casually lights a cigarette. \nQUAIL You know that's illegal. \nKIRSTEN Yeah?  Who's going to report me?  You?... wimp.... \nShe watches a torrid love scene on the video. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) Screwing around's illegal, too.  But just give me half a chance... \nQuail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes to one of resolve. \n10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY \nQuail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting. \nQuail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills. \nThe door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.) \nOLD LADY Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull. Sorry I'm late. (walks toward coat closet) I'll be right with you. \nShe dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest. \nQUAIL (looking at instrument console) This really going to work? \nLULL It the Pope Martian? \nLull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over at Lull. \nERNIE (TECHNICIAN) (at machine) Okay -- that's it. \nNow, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension. \nLULL Now, just relax, kid.  This ain't gonna hurt.  Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you're under, I'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs. \nShe injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes it down. \nLULL (continuing) See?  Painless.  I didn't feel a thing.  Hey, you're a nice kid... you like a little somethin' extra? \nQuail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods. \nLULL (continuing; pleased) Good!  Kid -- have I got a girl for you!  She's gonna like you.  You're good-lookin'. (beat) Gettin' sleepy? (he nods) Good.  Now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about Mars? \nQUAIL (wistfully) Well... I'd like to see the Martian Sphinx... \nLULL Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me. \nQUAIL (sleepily) One hundred... ninety-nine... ninety-eight... ninety-seven... ninety-six... ninety-five.... \n", "test1_true": "LULL Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars; number sixty-two... and throw in that blonde... We'll give him a real good time. \nERNIE Sixty-two... and... the blonde... \nHe takes two discs and inserts the first one into a machine. \nERNIE Boy, is this one wild.  He won't want to come back. \nErnie inserts the second disk. \nLULL Dougie?  This Sophie Lull. Can ya hear me? \nQUAIL ...Sophie.... \nLULL Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya a few more questions now.  Ya think you'll be able to answer 'em? \nQUAIL ...Yes.... \nLULL Attaboy!  To begin with, I wanna ask ya; -- You sex life.  How many orgasms a week? \n11      INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - DAY \nMcClane has several file drawers open and is removing diverse objects and placing them on his desk. \nThese items apparently are objects Rekall, Inc. intends to \"plant\" for some client of theirs to find (perhaps even Quail) -- as part of his fantasy. \nWhile he is putting these things on his desk, the PHONE BUZZES.  He answers it. \nMcCLANE Yes? \nLULL (V.O.) (filtered; tense) Howie?  Listen, you'd better get in here. \nMcCLANE (not too concerned) Not another schizoid embolism. \nLULL (V.O.) (filtered) You'd better get in here. \n12      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY \nMcClane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open. \nLull and Ernie look up as he enters.  Quail lies on the couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed. McClane looks queryingly at Lull, who motions him to silence. \nLULL (bends over Quail) Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me? \nQUAIL Yes. \nLULL Tell McClane what you told us. \nMcClane glances sharply at Lull, then turns to Quail. \nQuail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become cold and steely.  In fact, Quail's entire personality seems to have changed -- his face has acquired a flint- edged hardness.  He is chillingly menacing. \nQUAIL (a deadly voice) All of you in this room are dead. \nMcCLANE (not quite taking it seriously) What's he talking about? \nQUAIL You've broken my cover. \nMcCLANE What is this?... \nMcClane's eyes flash angrily at Lull. \n", "test1_id": 891, "test2_input": "QUAIL My God!  No!  You're going to kill me! \nHe cringes.  His hands across his face. \n1ST AGENT No one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] We're visiting E.I.O. for some new tests.  Now get in, or do we start playing rough? \nQUAIL No!  It's not my fault!  You can't do it! \nThey start to force him into the car physically. \nSuddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression. \nQUAIL (continuing) Wait a minute, I remember -- \n1ST AGENT What, Quail?  What do you remember? \nQUAIL On Mars... they tried to kill me... And.... \nQUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE. \nIn an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the windpipe, and they crumple to the ground. \nQuail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous; then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they belong to someone else. \nThen, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he races back into the basement door of his building. \n18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nKirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail bursts in.  He is still disoriented. \nQUAIL Did you know I've been to Mars? \nKirsten gets up and turns off the movie. \nKIRSTEN What!  This stupid obsess... \nQUAIL (interrupting) I think I've been.  I vaguely recall... \nKIRSTEN Doug, you've got to forget... \nQUAIL (interrupting) Forget?  Remembering is the problem I must've been to one of those artificial memory places... \nKIRSTEN Oh my God... \nQUAIL But something went wrong... something about a real memory... and then those men...  tried to kill me. \nKIRSTEN What men?  Doug, you're crazy. \nShe starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) You're here now.  They didn't kill you. \nQUAIL No.  That's what's so amazing. I killed them.  I think... \nKirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply. \nKIRSTEN Where?  Where are they? \nQuail points down with his finger. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) Doug!  It's something they put into your mind at the memory place.  Fantasies. That's their business. \n", "test2_true": "KIRSTEN (continuing) You're a computer operator. You're a bore.  You're a wimp.  You're not a killer. \nQUAIL I'm involved somehow with E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no fantasy. \nHe walks around the apartment drawing curtains and putting out the lights. \nKIRSTEN Doug, I want you to see a doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley Turnbull have a good man.  He helped Alec through his breakdown. \nQUAIL For fuck's sake, this is no breakdown! \nKirsten is taken aback at his use of language.  He strides into the bathroom and slams the door.  She turns on one lamp, goes to a telephone and dials. \n19      INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT \nQuail takes a washcloth, turns the hot water up full and soaks the cloth under the steaming water.  Using it as a compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to drain off some of the tension. \nHe turns off the water.  Towelling his head dry, he opens the bathroom door. \nThe instant he does this, a blinding white BURST OF LIGHT comes arcing into the bathroom, and the back wall crinkles and CHARS into a swatch of blackness. \nQUAIL DIVES OUT THE DOOR, just as ANOTHER BOLT incinerates the spot where he was standing. \n20      INT. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT \nTHE ROOM IS IN TOTAL DARKNESS.  The only thing visible is the pale rectangle of the balcony window, with the curtains drawn over it. \nQUAIL and his ASSAILANT cannot be seen -- but they can be HEARD.  There is the sound of a SCUFFLE -- the meaty THUD of a FIST CONNECTING WITH FLESH -- and a painful GRUNT as someone's breath whooshes out. \nThe LIGHT COMES ON.  Quail is standing with one hand on the lamp, and the other twisting KIRSTEN's arm up behind her back.  A pistol lies on the floor.  Quail is totally stunned. He releases her arm, shoving her away from him, at the same time scooping up the pistol. \nQUAIL My God!  Did you say I need a psychiatrist? \nKIRSTEN (coolly) I haven't seen you move that fast since I've known you. \nQUAIL (outraged) How could you do it?  After eight years! \nKIRSTEN I'm not your wife, Quail. \nQUAIL Not my wife!  You are out of your mind. \nKIRSTEN (indifferent; nursing her arm) It's a false memory implant. I never saw you before six weeks ago. \nQuail is totally disoriented. \nQUAIL Why are you lying like this? \nKIRSTEN No, Quail.  It's true.  You work for E.I.O.  So do I. \nAs she speaks, she walks to a picture on the wall and from behind it pulls out a small wallet.  She flips it open to show him her E.I.O. badge.  He looks down uncomprehendingly at the holographic lettering \"Earth Intelligence Organisation\". \nQUAIL (indicating their surroundings) But why all of this? \nKIRSTEN (shrugging) We had to watchdog you...make sure the erasure took.  A wife seemed like a good idea. \nQUAIL But I remember it!  All of it!... Us! \nKIRSTEN All implanted. \nQUAIL Our friends... my work... eight years. \nKIRSTEN The job's real -- you've had is six weeks -- since you got back from Mars. \n", "test2_id": 892, "test3_input": "BENNIE If that means I know it all, you're right, boss. \nQUAIL What do you know about the Sphinx? \nBENNIE I don't know nothin'.  Not about the Sphinx.  That's out of the ball park. \nQUAIL I have to get there.  Can't you help me? \nBENNIE No can do, mon.  You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water... Bennie's your man. But the Sphinx... that's E.I.O. -- \n80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT \nThe solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops. He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout CURSES, OBSCENITIES -- \nBENNIE Well... look at that one, eh? \nQUAIL What? \nBENNIE Big cheese in town.  Big smelly cheese. \nQUAIL Cohaagen?  But isn't he often here? \nBENNIE No way.  That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must be cookin'. \nQuail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who perhaps faintly remembers him in the past. \n82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nQuail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser, studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard. \nQuail opens a drawer, takes out his \"emergency case,\" sets it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder. \nHe sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions. He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at the door. \nQuail freezes.  Another KNOCK. \nVOICE (O.S.) (through door) Mr. Hauser... \nQUAIL Who is it? \nVOICE (O.S.) Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you... about Douglas Quail. \nQuail ditches the recorder and the \"emergency case\" into the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL. \nQuail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side -- out of the line of fire). \nQUAIL (tensely) Who are you? \nVOICE (O.S.) My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall, Incorporated. \nQUAIL (stunned; incredulous) Rekall?? \nVOICE (O.S.) Yes.  It's difficult to explain... Could you open the door, please?  I'm not armed. \nQuail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out of view of the person at the door. \nA dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit. \nEDGEMAR Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come in?  I won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me. \nHe can't see the gun, but somehow knows. \n", "test3_true": "Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters, holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card. \nEDGEMAR My card, Mr. Quail. \nQuail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it. \nQUAIL Okay -- so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc.'  So? \nEDGEMAR As I said... this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us. \nQUAIL I'm listening. \nEDGEMAR Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment. \nQUAIL Sat that again. \nEDGEMAR I said, you're not really here.  Neither am I.  We're both in the Memory Studio -- in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On Earth. \nLong pause. \nQUAIL Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some... artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left Earth? \nEDGEMAR No, not quite.  We didn't give you this.  You're creating it yourself -- (pauses, choosing his words) Remember the option we offered you?  Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating. \nQUAIL What is this shit you're giving me? \nEDGEMAR This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail. It's the truth. (beat) I know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction... we can't snap you out of the Narkadine.  You're in a world of your own fantasy. \nQUAIL Then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it's just a dream? \nEDGEMAR I've been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy.  I'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. This is a last resort.  When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them.  A specialist, like myself. \nQUAIL I don't believe a word you're saying. \nEDGEMAR I was afraid you'd think that. I'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck. (calls out) Doctor Noel, would you come in now please? \nThe door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his gun at the opening door. \nMELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail with professional detachment. \nMELINA Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid it's all true. \nQuail is staggered. \nMELINA (continuing) I tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you. \nQUAIL (wavering) So what's supposed to happen now? \nEDGEMAR Just do exactly as we tell you. \nQUAIL (stares at him coldly) Somehow that doesn't appeal to me. \nMELINA Please, Mr. Quail... try to cooperate.  You're having a schizophrenic embolism. \nEDGEMAR If we can't get you out now... you may never come out of it. Your wife calls every day -- \nCLOSE - QUAIL \nEven more suspicious. \nTWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR \n", "test3_id": 893}

{"train": "\"TOTAL RECALL\" \nScreen Story and Screenplay \nby \nRonald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon \nFifth Revision \nby \nRonald Shusett and Steven Pressfield \n\"TOTAL RECALL\" \nFADE IN: \n1       EXT. DESERT - DAY \nAll we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in \"Gone with the Wind\". \nSUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit. \nPAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below... the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in the process. \nSLOW DISOLVE \nOPENING CREDITS BEGIN. \nANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again. DISSOLVE. \nANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect- ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust.  DISSOLVE... \nANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face, though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE. \nCAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front. It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems. \nAs CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera... \n2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW \"SPHINX\" - DAY \nA MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him, as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS over a portion of it. \nThe surface of the tunnel's \"walls\" is curious;  the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal. \nThe man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear- fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD. Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man, and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a SATANIC suggestion to the scene. \nSuddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it. \nWe are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to SAFETY. \nABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE; with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see -- ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out of molten lava. \nSUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE: \nTOTAL RECALL \nHOLD. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nQUAIL We can pool our savings and I've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation... \nKIRSTEN (interrupting; corrects herself) ...more of a half-wit.  For a start a war could break out there any day ... \nShe gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs reading \"A FREE MARS\", \"DOWN WITH COHAAGEN\", \"EARTH - OUT\" etc. \nQUAIL That's just media talk.  They're... (indicating the protesters) ...just a minority.  They're powerless. \nKIRSTEN Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a better job.... \nThe kitchen clock chimes and talks. \nCLOCK It's now eight.  You'll be late! \nQUAIL I'll be late! \nHe jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves. \n4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING \nCAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly. \n5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING \nQuail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms. \nTWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket. \nGUARD No weapon again, Mr. Quail? \nQUAIL I keep forgetting, Herb.  They frighten me. \nGUARD Yeah?  Well, it's the law, Mr. Quail.  Has been since 1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported. \nGUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been through this with Quail before. \nQUAIL Okay.  Herb, okay. \nQuail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives. Signs above each approaching car say \"CAR FULL\", \"ROOM FOR 10 PERSONS\", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked \"NEW CAR\". \n6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY \nThe doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) -- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies -- \nEveryone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks instantly at the word \"Mars.\" \nThe NEWSCASTER is a young black man. \nNEWSCASTER (continuing) ...but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups.... \nTV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur- rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power. \nCOHAAGEN We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics.  Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth... and will remain so. \nThe train stops at another station and more people pile on. Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image. \nREPORTER (V.O.) There have been some criticisms, sir.... \nCOHAAGEN I have no further comment. \nQUAIL I don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake.  I won't really have gone.  I won't really.... \nMcCLANE (kind but firm) Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for EIO.  This - REKALL - is the only way to achieve your dream. \nHe gets up and walks around to Quail's chair. \nMcCLANE (continuing) Think about it, Douglas. Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories. \nQuail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced. \n9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nQuail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on TV.  She casually lights a cigarette. \nQUAIL You know that's illegal. \nKIRSTEN Yeah?  Who's going to report me?  You?... wimp.... \nShe watches a torrid love scene on the video. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) Screwing around's illegal, too.  But just give me half a chance... \nQuail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes to one of resolve. \n10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY \nQuail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting. \nQuail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills. \nThe door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.) \nOLD LADY Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull. Sorry I'm late. (walks toward coat closet) I'll be right with you. \nShe dons a white medical smock that covers her jogging suit, then slings on heavy, lead-lined protective vest. \nQUAIL (looking at instrument console) This really going to work? \nLULL It the Pope Martian? \nLull's assistant, the TECHNICIAN in b.g., who had been steadily working on the instrumentation, now looks over at Lull. \nERNIE (TECHNICIAN) (at machine) Okay -- that's it. \nNow, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension. \nLULL Now, just relax, kid.  This ain't gonna hurt.  Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you're under, I'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs. \nShe injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes it down. \nLULL (continuing) See?  Painless.  I didn't feel a thing.  Hey, you're a nice kid... you like a little somethin' extra? \nQuail, embarrassed, starting to go under, nods. \nLULL (continuing; pleased) Good!  Kid -- have I got a girl for you!  She's gonna like you.  You're good-lookin'. (beat) Gettin' sleepy? (he nods) Good.  Now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about Mars? \nQUAIL (wistfully) Well... I'd like to see the Martian Sphinx... \nLULL Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me. \nQUAIL (sleepily) One hundred... ninety-nine... ninety-eight... ninety-seven... ninety-six... ninety-five.... \nLULL The Narkadine cracked a memory cap.  Mars -- (she's scared) He's really been there. \nThere is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests this. \nMcCLANE Forced suppression? \nERNIE With spontaneous breakthrough. \nMcCLANE Holy shit. \nThey stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb. \nQUAIL (coldly) You've compromised the Sphinx Project.  You'll have to be silenced. \nNow they're all panicked. \nMcCLANE Wait a minute.  Quail -- \nQUAIL My name isn't Quail. \nMcCLANE Listen... whoever you are... sir.... (almost pleading) ...This is all an accident. We'll destroy all the records. No one will know.  I swear it. Believe me. \nQUAIL I believe you, but that won't stop E.T.O. from killing you. \nThe Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror. \nQUAIL (continuing) Killing you... killing you... killing you.... \nHis voice trails off, his eyes close. \nLULL (intensely) He wants a false memory implanted -- of a trip he really took. (pause) Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory. All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him. \nERNIE What do we do?  Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing? \nLULL (shaking her head) Uh-uh... That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip. \nMcCLANE (overlapping) Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here. \nLULL Why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here? \nMcCLANE (nodding; relieved) Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy his file and cancel his fee. I have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be.  I'm taking a holiday. A real one. \nHe leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim. \n12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY \nA dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit door. \nAn attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view Quail's progress. \n12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY \nQuail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at the city. \n12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY \nQuail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone. \n12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON \nScene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks around, slowly coming to his senses. \nQUAIL My God!  No!  You're going to kill me! \nHe cringes.  His hands across his face. \n1ST AGENT No one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] We're visiting E.I.O. for some new tests.  Now get in, or do we start playing rough? \nQUAIL No!  It's not my fault!  You can't do it! \nThey start to force him into the car physically. \nSuddenly, Quail stops cringing.  the FEAR DISAPPEARS FROM HIS FACE, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression. \nQUAIL (continuing) Wait a minute, I remember -- \n1ST AGENT What, Quail?  What do you remember? \nQUAIL On Mars... they tried to kill me... And.... \nQUAIL TRANSFORMS INTO A HIGHLY SKILLED KILLING MACHINE. \nIn an instant, he karate-chops both agents across the windpipe, and they crumple to the ground. \nQuail steps back.  He stares at the two bodies, incredulous; then stares at his own deadly HANDS.  It is as though they belong to someone else. \nThen, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he races back into the basement door of his building. \n18      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nKirsten is watching another pornographic video when Quail bursts in.  He is still disoriented. \nQUAIL Did you know I've been to Mars? \nKirsten gets up and turns off the movie. \nKIRSTEN What!  This stupid obsess... \nQUAIL (interrupting) I think I've been.  I vaguely recall... \nKIRSTEN Doug, you've got to forget... \nQUAIL (interrupting) Forget?  Remembering is the problem I must've been to one of those artificial memory places... \nKIRSTEN Oh my God... \nQUAIL But something went wrong... something about a real memory... and then those men...  tried to kill me. \nKIRSTEN What men?  Doug, you're crazy. \nShe starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) You're here now.  They didn't kill you. \nQUAIL No.  That's what's so amazing. I killed them.  I think... \nKirsten stops pouring her drink and look at him sharply. \nKIRSTEN Where?  Where are they? \nQuail points down with his finger. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) Doug!  It's something they put into your mind at the memory place.  Fantasies. That's their business. \nHe sits down, holds his hand to his head. \nKIRSTEN (continuing) It's all a fabrication, Quail. Everything you know. \nQUAIL This is crazy!  If all my memories are false, who am I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's like I don't exist. \nKIRSTEN You exist, all right. (very cold) That's the problem. \nA pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to do next. \nQUAIL Why did you try to kill me? Why does E.I.O. want me dead? \nKIRSTEN They don't particularly.  That was my idea.  This assignment was boring me to death.  The personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling. \nQUAIL Well, what did I do on Mars that they have to keep me from telling? \nKIRSTEN I've no idea.  I just work here. \nQUAIL All right... I'm leaving. Don't try and follow me -- \nKIRSTEN I don't have to follow you. You can't get away from E.I.O. Nobody does. \nQuail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time. \nQUAIL No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife -- type casting. \nHe leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS. \n21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nQuail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he heads for the nearest subway entrance. \n22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT \nNow underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check. \n23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nAn OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it. \n24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nQuail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him, pleased to see he has remembered his gun. \n25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nAll the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to see four large men brandishing guns push their way through the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at them. \nThe gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men halt abruptly. \nFIRST GUNMAN Fuck it! \nThe second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver - in his ear. \nSECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER) We won't be able to track him again until he comes up above ground! \n26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT \nQuail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video. \nTV AS VOICE OVER Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a vacation?  Don't settle for memories, experience the real thing.  Daily departures on the space shuttle to Mars.  Visit the wonders of.... \nQUAIL (handing over money) Here's ten thousand.  Forget the ID. \nDESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand hovers over the money. \nQUAIL (continuing) I have a liaison with a lady... and I'm married... \nDESK CLERK I understand, sir.  Nothing like a bit on the side, eh? Bit of fugitive flesh.  The greatest aphrodisiac is a new body, wouldn't you say, sir? \nQuail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to be given the key to his room.  He says nothing. \n30      INT. \"END OF THE LINE\" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nQuail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares at it for three rings, then picks it up. \nQUAIL (into receiver) I told you, I don't want to be disturbed. \nTELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) If you want to live, don't hand up. \nQuail is stunned.  He says nothing, but doesn't hang up. \nTELEPHONE VOICE (continuing; filtered) They've got you bugged... They're gonna find you. Faster than you can say \"Back Rodgers\". (quickly) And don't bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull. \nQUAIL (reeling) Who are you?  What the hell is this? \n30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT \nThe man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion- ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly and urgently. \nTELEPHONE VOICE Take a wet towel and wrap it around your head.  That will deaden the signal.  It'll take longer for them to pinpoint you. \n30B     INT QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nQUAIL Why should I trust you? \nTELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) There's a real old saying - \"Beggars can't be choosers\". Go and soak your head! \nQuail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom. \n30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nThe earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated cross on the dashboard map cuts out. \nEARPHONE WEARER Shit! \nDRIVER Cut the language, will ya? \nEARPHONE WEARER It's gone!  Some...malfunction... \nUnscientifically, he prod the screen. \nDRIVER (world-weary air) Toldya the Martian assembled [stuff don't work.] \n30B2    INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nQuail rushes back into the room with a wet towel, turban-like, wrapped around his head.  He rapidly picks up the phone. \nQUAIL Keep talking. \nTELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) Head over to Skid Row -- to the Lucky Stub Pawnshop -- corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth.  Tell the man you're Mr. Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks. \nQUAIL (infuriated) What do I want with Grecian candlesticks! \nQUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping over a BUM in a doorway. \n34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT \nQuail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead, tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance. \nAt once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room. \nPAWNBROKER You wanta camera?  I got some good, top-quality ones.  You want silk rugs?  Handmade last century in Iran...all perfect. You want videos?  Old movies... classics...all those Vietnam war ones...real quaint stuff... you want... \nQUAIL (interrupting; awkwardly) I'm Hotchkiss...I came for the...Grecian candlesticks... \nThe Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then he disappears through the curtain. \nIn a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small, \"makeup-sized\" case, as well as two large candelabra. \nThe Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks at the case with curiosity. \nQUAIL (continuing) I wonder if you could tell me... \nThey both look around as someone enters. \nPAWNBROKER I trust these will look well in you... mosque. \n35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS \nOpening up the small case. \nPULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel room he's now in is obviously a different one than the last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down, the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older, etc. \nQuail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of it red. \nCLOSE ON RED MONEY \nOn the face of it is printed:  \"MARS FEDERAL COLONY\". \nQUAIL (mutters) Martian money.... \nQuail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to himself as he sees how much there is. \nAlso in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read) and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail -- down to the clothes Quail is wearing now. \nThe image stands and watches Quail. \nQUAIL (continuing) What the hell...? \nQuail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like a television set being turned off. \nQuail looks bemused. \nNow he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge, a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve. \nHe turns on the cassette recorder. \nThe VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN! \nCASSETTE VOICE (V.O.) (Quail's voice) \"Hauser, this is Hauser -- or whatever you think your name is now.  If you're listening to this, I'm talking to myself. Your memory's been erased and you've got a wet towel around your head. (he does) \"The first thing you've got to do is get rid of that bug in your head.\" \n36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe sound of the tape continues as Quail follows instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion of his neck, just below the ear. \nThe red-headed man nods. \nCOHAAGEN (continuing) Are you sure the original suppression took? \nSUPERVISOR Absolutely, sir.  He thinks he's Quail, a computer... \nCOHAAGEN (interrupting) Then how do you explain what he's doing? \nSUPERVISOR Just his instincts.  He was well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe the memory cap's fractured. Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through. \nCOHAAGEN (very anxious) He'll remember Mars?  The Sphinx Project? \nSUPERVISOR Fragments.  Nothing more. Nothing he could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative. \nCOHAAGEN What do you think I am?  A barbarian?  We're not living in the twentieth century! \nHe looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl. \nCOHAAGEN (continuing) Hold it there. \nHe studies the picture, which changes to show the same girl from different angles. \n42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY \nPassengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that they shine in the face of each passenger going through. (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.) \nThe passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials, government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... \"MARTIAN TOUR GROUP\". \nThe last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door begins to close. \nPLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 If he had to travel to Mars with that bunch, I'd be sorry for him. \nPLAINCLOTHES MAN #2 We couldn't have missed him? \nPLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 No way.  Let's get a coffee before the next shuttle. \n43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT \nOne of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her handbag, and some clothes on a hanger. \n44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT \nThe woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we saw in Quail's emergency kit. \nShe holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask. \nShe lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL. He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute. \nHe reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his \"FALSIES.\" \nCLOSE ON MASK \nWe can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now: \"LASER FACIAL\". \n45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT \nQuail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video theater advertising \"ROCKY 36\" with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited, but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an announcement comes over the intercom. \nA LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail looks up. \nCAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight -- \nBOY Smogpsucker! \nFrom the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC SONG. \nDOORMAN You know how it is, sir.  Some of these red-asses are a bit prejudiced. \nQUAIL Prejudiced?  Against what? \nDOORMAN Earthmen. \nThe street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS joining the belligerent chorus. \nQUAIL What are they singing? \nDOORMAN The Martian National Anthem. \nQuail tips the doorman, enter the hotel. \n57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY \nQuail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE BOY looks up at Quail. \nQuail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in spotless linen fill the lobby. \nQuail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written \"THE FIRST WONDER OF MARS\".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech -- \nCANNED VOICE \"...the Martian Sphinx... only evidence of non-human civilization ever discovered ...age estimated at over eighteen million years... \nCLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY \nHe stares at Quail. \nBACK TO SCENE \nQuail approaches the Registration Desk. \nCLERK Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Hauser. \nQuail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by this name.  He tries to stay casual. \nQUAIL Nice to be back. (pick up pen) I'm flattered you remember me. \nCLERK Part of my job, sir. \nQUAIL (starts to sign; hesitates) Do you remember my first name, too? \nCLERK Charles.  Charles Hauser, right? \nQUAIL I'm impressed. (now he signs) Listen.  I need transportation to the... uh... the Sphinx. Can you arrange it for me? \nCLERK I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely. No one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles. \nThe Clerk taps a few keys on a computer. \nCLERK Oh... (spots something on the computer) Do you want the item you left with us? \nQUAIL What item?  Oh... yes, please. \nThe Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail. \n58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX \nMINER #5 ...aw, come on... flyin's safer'n crossin' the road... \nMINER #6 ...yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago... \nMINER #4 (alarmed) ...well, that killed twelve thousand... \nQUAIL What is this, Bennie... Tombstone? \nBENNIE Sorta.  Bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell... \nQuail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER. \nQUAIL I'm looking for Melina Noel. \nBARTENDER You've found her. \nHis nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away. \nMELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him. \nMELINA You bastard! \nAlmost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors. \nThere are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail, bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which illuminates the area of the table. \n(NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.) \nMelina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection of how well he might have known this woman. \nSuddenly, she slaps him hard across the face. \nMELINA (quietly) You bastard... \nHe rubs his painful cheek. \nMELINA (continuing) That's new -- the innocent look. (bitter sarcasm) You didn't have that one before. (beat) Well? \nQuail is speechless. \nQUAIL Well, uh... I... \nMELINA All right, I'll say it for you. \nHe looks relieved (but tries to cover). \nMELINA (continuing) Don't worry.  I got the note. You discharged your obligation. \nQUAIL What note? \nMELINA Oh, the usual one.  \"Must return immediately to Earth... the wife needs me...\" \nQUAIL I don't have a wife.  Well, I do - but not a real wife. (getting desperate) Hell... look... someone else sent that note.  Someone who -- \nMELINA What are you here for?! \nQUAIL For you!  I don't even know why -- \nMelina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then pushes him away. \nQUAIL (continuing) Whoever I was, I must have been a helluva guy. \nBENNIE If that means I know it all, you're right, boss. \nQUAIL What do you know about the Sphinx? \nBENNIE I don't know nothin'.  Not about the Sphinx.  That's out of the ball park. \nQUAIL I have to get there.  Can't you help me? \nBENNIE No can do, mon.  You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water... Bennie's your man. But the Sphinx... that's E.I.O. -- \n80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT \nThe solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops. He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout CURSES, OBSCENITIES -- \nBENNIE Well... look at that one, eh? \nQUAIL What? \nBENNIE Big cheese in town.  Big smelly cheese. \nQUAIL Cohaagen?  But isn't he often here? \nBENNIE No way.  That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must be cookin'. \nQuail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who perhaps faintly remembers him in the past. \n82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nQuail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser, studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard. \nQuail opens a drawer, takes out his \"emergency case,\" sets it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder. \nHe sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions. He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at the door. \nQuail freezes.  Another KNOCK. \nVOICE (O.S.) (through door) Mr. Hauser... \nQUAIL Who is it? \nVOICE (O.S.) Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you... about Douglas Quail. \nQuail ditches the recorder and the \"emergency case\" into the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL. \nQuail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side -- out of the line of fire). \nQUAIL (tensely) Who are you? \nVOICE (O.S.) My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall, Incorporated. \nQUAIL (stunned; incredulous) Rekall?? \nVOICE (O.S.) Yes.  It's difficult to explain... Could you open the door, please?  I'm not armed. \nQuail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out of view of the person at the door. \nA dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit. \nEDGEMAR Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come in?  I won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me. \nHe can't see the gun, but somehow knows. \nA man enters from another room.  Although the man's features are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl draped around the back of his neck. \nSTRANGE MAN (nodding to Quail) Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life. \nAs Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce, to Melina. \nQUAIL What use is this weirdo? \nMELINA Ssssh...there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten. \nKUATO No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail. (smiles at Quail's surprise) Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds. \nFrom the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams occasionally sweep past the windows. \nKUATO (continuing) This way, my dear man.  We have much to accomplish -- (ominously) -- and very little time. \n102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT \nA Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows. \n(NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the apprehension of Quail and Melina... \nVOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER ...for information leading to these arrests, first-class travel to Earth will be provided plus a weekend at the Leningrad Disneyworld, all expenses paid.  I repeat, an Oriental girl and Earthman, possibly to be found in the company of a black taxi driver. These are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of the glorious Peoples Republic of Mars...) \nKUATO The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself. \nKuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to join him.  Quail hesitates. \nQUAIL And you're going to help me by reading my mind? \nKUATO Indubitably.  There is only small matter of a fee. \nTHREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER. \nQUAIL A fee! \nKAUTO Naturally. \nMELINA This is for our cause! \nKUATO (soothingly) Income before ideals.  Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars? \nQUAIL (appalled) Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's... (think, calculating the exchange rate) \nKUATO Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth dollars. \nMELINA That's interplanetary robbery! \nQUAIL With today's exchange rate... that's over two million Martian dollars! \nKUATO (suave) What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the future of the solar system? \nBENNIE Aw, come off it, man.  Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball. \nKUATO (his manner slipping) Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here.  You try and work out what's with this guy! \nHe jerks his thumb toward Quail. \nQUAIL Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this. \nEveryone calms down. \nMELINA What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us. \nQUAIL The Sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago.  The same race that built the on one Earth... for the same purpose. \nHe stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front. \nQUAIL (continuing) This is what we need. \nHe begins to climb in;  the others follow. \nBENNIE (referring to the Sphinx) It's a hunk of old stone, man. \nMELINA (ditto) Purpose?  What purpose? \nBennie starts the engine. \nQUAIL Come on, Bennie, move it. (then, to Melina) Have you heard the word, \"terriform\"? \nMelina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off. \n115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING \nGUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports. \nThe vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives. \n115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING \nBennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting, looking for Quail and Melina. \nBENNIE (calling to Guards) Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia.  Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well. \nThe Guards laugh and signal him on. \nOnce through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats. \nQUAIL The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators... \nBENNIE You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail? \nMELINA (overlapping) For what?  To do what? \nQUAIL To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. \nBENNIE That's air! \n116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING \nIn a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of Mars. \nQUAIL That's right.  Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars.  No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert.  There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth. \nMELINA (baffled) So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out? \nQUAIL Don't you see?!  From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into  a chunk of priceless real estate. \nMELINA And Cohaagen's going to own it all! \nQUAIL Right!  He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth.  Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it. \nMELINA No wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group. \nSimultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out! All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT! \nQuail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him clear across the bus. \nMelina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN. \nBennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch-- \n121     EXT. DESERT - DAY \nThe E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in. \n122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY \nQuail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing. \nBennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES -- \nBENNIE This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else. \nBennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING. Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW! \nThe fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed. \nNow Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him. Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay. But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when -- \nQuail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and -- \nThe BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL VACUUM! \nNow no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks, [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie -- \nThe SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp- ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall! \nQuail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers -- \n122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY \nBennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon with all its air gone. \n122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY \nMelina hides her face in horror.  At that instant -- \n122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY \nBullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud- speakers call for Quail's surrender. \n122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY \nQuail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button marked \"Dive\".  The vehicle tilts. \n122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY \nThe vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire, the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the Sphinx looms ominously. \nA driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't be heard but can only be radioing a report. \n123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND \nThe little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by its BORER NOSE. \nWe HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede. \nThe two remaining guards realize their isolation; they glance tensely to one another. \nGUARD #1 Did you hear something? \nGUARD #2 No.  Where? \nGUARD #1 Over there. \nThe First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft -- right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the ready: \nQUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.) (from behind the guards) I'm not there, boys.  I'm here. \nThe guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no gun) \nBoth guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with their weapons. \nGUARD #1 (to Guard #2) Watch him.  He was EIO trained. They're all full of tricks. \nGUARD #2 Yeah?  Like...who was that guy? -- Fred Bond?? (to Quail) Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em up. \nQuail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound, then disappears. \nGUARD #1 A hologram! \nBefore either Guard can react, the real Quail appears -- one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.) \nQuail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her one of the Guard's guns. \n130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE \nALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: \"LEVEL ONE\". \nMELINA (running) Where'd you get that little trick? \nQUAIL (running) Mail-order company.  It's a great one for fooling the wife. \n131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN) \nCohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on Level One. \nCOHAAGEN How the hell did they get in? \nSECURITY AIDE Up the fusion core. \nCOHAAGEN Up the fusion core?? \nHe exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail. \nSECURITY AIDE (studies monitor more carefully) They're on Level One. \nA wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  \"LEVEL THIRTEEN\". \nCOHAAGEN Seal all upper levels. \nA button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room off from the outside corridors. \n133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR \nQuail and Melina are still racing through the corridors. He passes her a fresh ammo belt. \nQuail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes -- \n142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nThe video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator, with earphones, turns to Cohaagen. \nOPERATOR First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir.  Two minute countdown. \n142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY \nQuail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes, pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks -- \n143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM \nA MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere) detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a storm of shards and shrapnell. \nInstantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their \nCOHAAGEN Seal the breach!  Repressurize! \nAn aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now -- \nQuail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are choking, struggling with their masks. \nAn EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal atmosphere stabilizes -- \nNone of the men inside the control room still moves.  The victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level. Melina hurries to the main control panel. \nMelina looks towards the video monitors showing half a dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure. \nMELINA Those shuttles are starting up any minute.  If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now. \nQuail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex machinery. \nQUAIL Yes... \nHe hesitates. \nMELINA Don't you know how? \nTransfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control panel. \nQUAIL Yes... there's a vital connection missing... \nHe approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm towards a blank area a little above his head. \nQUAIL (continuing) ...me... \nCOHAAGEN Wait! \nMELINA Don't wait! \nCOHAAGEN If you activate the mechanism you'll die...there were glimpses of it in your memory. \nQUAIL Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me... \nCOHAAGEN (assured) That's your death.  That's what it looks like.  That's what is always looks like. \nQuail looks around him, half-convinced. \nMELINA (looking toward space shuttles on video screens) Charles - for Mars's sake.... \n", "test1_input": "QUAIL If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when I pull this trigger. \nEDGEMAR But there will by consequences inside your mind.  Consequences that won't hurt me... but could be fatal to you. (beat) If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy -- I can't come back again.  Because to you, I'll be dead.  I can't help you get back to reality. You'll be stuck in permanent psychosis. \nCLOSE - QUAIL \nTrembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face. \nCLOSE - EDGEMAR \nShowing no fear of tension whatever. \nEDGEMAR You're going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail.  You're going to hand it to me -- \nCLOSE - QUAIL \nStraining desperately to find the true \"reality.\" \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN \nQuail's finger on it. \nTWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR \nEDGEMAR You're going to do exactly what I tell you -- \nQuail PULLS THE TRIGGER! \nREVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD \nWe SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only, and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect: the back of Edgemar's head blows off -- \nHe collapses to the floor. \nMelina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND! \nMELINA Watch out, Charles!  There's more of them in the hall! \nQuail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor and slams against the wall, dead. \nVOICE (O.S.) (from hall) You've had it, Hauser!  Throw out your weapon if you want a past! \nMelina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side. \nMELINA (whispering) There's an explosive in the clipboard!  He has a dead-man switch in his hand! \nSqueezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN! \nVOICE (O.S.) What do you say, Hauser?  We haven't got all night!  Hauser? \nQuail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain. \nQUAIL What happens it I come out? \nQuail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to the side of the doorway. \nVOICE (O.S.) We'll put in a word with the big boys.  Maybe you'll just get exile to Venus. \nQUAIL All right.  Here comes the weapon. \nQuail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand -- \n", "test1_true": "83      INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nQuail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.  On the floor lies a DEAD MAN and the body of the Shoeshine Boy, sprawled grotesquely.  The hallway is filled with smoke.  The floor covered with debris.  Plaster falling from the ceiling. \nAll over the hotel, ALARMS begin BLARING. \n84      INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nQuail strides back in, icy-furious.  He seizes Melina by the wrist and drags her after him into the corridor. \n84A     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTwo more E.I.O. men appear but Quail shoots them while dragging Melina down the hall in the opposite direction. He pushes open the door leading to the staircase. \n84B     INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nQuail and Melina run down the stairs.  On the next landing is a service elevator, from which a waiter is emerging carefully carrying a tray with hors d'oeuvres and champagne. \nQUAIL Back in, quick! \nWAITER Wouldn't you prefer your order in your room, sir? \nQUAIL In! \nQuail bundles the waiter unceremoniously back inside the elevator. \n84C     INT. LIFT - NIGHT \nQuail presses the basement button.  As he talks to Melina he opens the champagne and pours two glasses.  The waiter is too frightened to protest. \nQUAIL Okay.  Answers!  Now! \nMELINA They kidnapped me.  Said they'd kill you if I didn't cooperate.  I told them I didn't care, but then when I realized they meant it... \nQUAIL I don't know why they're after me, but what's your connection with all this? \nMELINA We were together before. \nQUAIL Believe me, I'm really sorry I can't recall the details of that encounter. \nThe elevator has reached the basement.  They rush out. \n85      EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HILTON - NIGHT \nQuail and Melina run from a basement door into an alley. \nA solar car whips out in front of them.  Quail and Melina leap aboard. \nMELINA Go, Bennie, for God's sake! \n86      INT. BENNIE'S SOLAR CAR - NIGHT \nBennie weaves as fast as he can in and out of the traffic, Quail and Melina ducking out of view in the passenger seat. \nBENNIE (glances in mirror) Bad news, boss lady. \nMELINA What? \nBENNIE Black cruiser just pull out behind us. \n86A     EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 891, "test2_input": "A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way through the crowds and traffic behind them. \n86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nQuail is aiming his gun at the following car. \nBENNIE Forget the shooter, boss.  I lose 'em for you. \nQUAIL Lose them?  In this? \nBENNIE Hang on! \nBennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting LOUD ENGINE roars to life. \nBennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat. \n87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT \nGUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at the pursuing car. \nQUAIL (shouts over GUNFIRE) You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie -- \nBENNIE Yutani 650 -- you like it, boss?  Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed. \nBULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car. \nMELINA You better have two aces, Bennie. (glances behind) There's a second cruiser -- and it's gaining -- \n87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nBennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The water container tips and empties water through the open roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing) so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic- ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's car. \n88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nThe solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of the windows) in pursuit. \nAt the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into the narrow opening. \nThe second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur- veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered in blood and their clothes are in shreds. \nCOHAAGEN I take it, then, you've failed to get him again. \nCohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish, well-dressed executive type. \nCOHAAGEN (continuing) Proceed with Operation Sphinx. \nEMILE But, sir... \nCOHAAGEN With him... (gestures toward the mine) ...on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out. \n93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT \nThe solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in amazement. \nQUAIL What's all this? \nBENNIE Nothin', boss.  Just old smokies.  Only place they can come for a puff.  It's all banned topside. \nThey have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks searchingly at Melina and Bennie. \nQUAIL So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business. \n", "test2_true": "He unzips his jacket to reveal a T-shirt with \"MARTIAN LIBERATION FRONT\" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned on it. \nQUAIL My God!... T-shirts.  They died out on Earth years ago. \nBENNIE (hurt) Well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss. \nMELINA No.  But we still believe in a free Mars. \nThey walk as they talk - into a room off the main tunnel. It is adorned with \"FREE MARS\" and \"MARTIAN LIBERATION FRONT\" posters.  A group of people are printing T-shirts and leaflets.  They exchange greetings with Melina and Bennie. \nQUAIL So where did I fit into all this? \nMELINA You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group.  I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and I... \nHer gesture suggests their liaison. \nQUAIL Yeah.  And I can't even remember it.  We'll have to arrange a return bout. \nMELINA ...so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity. \nQUAIL But - the Sphinx.  Why is that stuck in my mind?  Why's it so important? \nMELINA I don't know. \nBENNIE Just an ole heap o' stone, boss. \nQUAIL It's more than that, Bennie, I know it's more.  Somehow it's connected. \nHe slumps into a chair with frustration. \nMELINA (reflecting) Maybe there's a way  you can get your memory back. \nQUAIL How?  What?  Where?  When? \nMELINA A bit of Martian Wisdom. We're not all stupid colonists. \n99      EXT. CITY - NIGHT \nBennie, Quail and Melina are walking in a crowded area of town.  Water sellers and food stalls are everywhere. An ARMORED LOUDSPEAKER VEHICLE appears, broadcasting to the crowd.  It is also swinging a powerful searchlight along the footpaths and streets. \nVOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER ...all residents are to report to their nearest space-travel agent within twelve hours, all residents will be departing on shuttles within twenty-four hours.  Air and water supplies will be cut off at that time.  I repeat... \nMELINA He's doing it! \nQUAIL What?  Why? \nMELINA Clearing everyone out!  It's been rumored for months... \nThe searchlight approaches Bennie, Quail and Melina.  Bennie ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses her passionately.  The light sees only the back of his head. She responds warmly to his kiss. \nQUAIL Wow.  I can see why I was willing to betray E.I.O. \nMELINA I though you believed in our cause? \nQUAIL Yes.  Of course.  That, too. \nThey move into the crowd.  The message on the loudspeaker is repeated. \n101     INT. KUATO'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT \nThe interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its ghetto exterior.  The decor is a baroque combination of Middle Eastern opulence and 21st century flash.  It looks like something out of \"The Arabian Nights\". \n", "test2_id": 892, "test3_input": "106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY \nMelina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises, with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss lingeringly;  then Quail, as if \"called to duty,\" exits. \nWHITE LIGHT. \n108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS \nQuail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly, the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT- PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the head. \nWHITE LIGHT. \n109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS \nQuail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic version of \"the rack,\" his head held imobile by a FEARSOME DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van the two agents tried to shove him into. \nSeveral DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves... Cohaagen! \nCohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony -- \nORACLE HEAD'S VOICE You have seen your past. Now read the future... \nWHITE LIGHT. \n110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT \nThe same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE. \nA man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail \nINSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL \nHe throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully, as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD! \nQuail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS -- \nTWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT! \nSHOCK CUT TO: \n111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT \nQuail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES: \nKUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato -- BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato. \nMELINA (rushes to Quail) Charles!  Are you all right? \nQuail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place -- \nMELINA (continuing) He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! We couldn't wake either of you! \nBENNIE You stopped breathing! \nQuail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine. \nQUAIL Why did you kill him?  It was the next bit I really... \nBENNIE No choice, boss.  It was him or you. \nQuail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a last flicker of life. \n", "test3_true": "A MUFFLED CHOCKED SOUND comes from behind Kuato's neck. It's the Oracle Head!  Quail instantly rolls Kuato's body over.  The Head is still alive! \nQuail bends closer, kneeling. \nORACLE HEAD (whispers) -- the vengence you seek... and the salvation of Mars... are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx. (sags, gasping) \nThe Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth. \nBENNIE Phobos and Demos!  What was that all about? \nQuail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought -- over the Oracle Head. \nMELINA Are you okay?... Charles? Doug?  Whoever? \nQuail reaches out and closes the Oracle Head's tiny eyelids.  Melina and Bennie exchange a glance.  Then: \nQUAIL \nStands.  For a moment his back is to Melina and Bennie. Then he turns. \nHe has become a different man.  His eyes gleam.  He is forceful, purposeful, contained.  Once again the ace E.I.O. agent.  Melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before \nQUAIL (even his voice has changed) I'm fine... only I'm not Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser... and I know everything Hauser knew. \nHe turns to Bennie \nQUAIL (continuing) Bennie, where's your depot? \nBENNIE (working it out) Well... you go outta here... take a left, then down past the first... no second... water bureau you... \nQUAIL (briskly) Can you get us there? \nBENNIE No problem. \nMELINA But why? \nQUAIL We're going to the Sphinx. \nHe strides off.  The others follow, still full of questions. \nBENNIE Impossible, man.  Guards everywhere. \nMELINA The Oracle... what did you learn? \nQUAIL Only everything.  I've got total recall. \nThey are now heading down the stairs toward the street. \n114     EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING \nQuail, Melina and Bennie make their way through the crowds to Bennie's depot.  The streets are even busier then before - people are now beginning to evacuate the city.  Everyone is carrying their possessions - bundles, suitcases, pets, etc., etc.  The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad- casting the same message. \nBennie indicates a building on their left. \n115     INT. CAR POOL - EARLY MORNING \nBennie and Melina follow Quail as he walks up and down the rows of vehicles in the vast building.  There are bull- dozers and ore haulers as well as solar taxis. \nBENNIE We'll never get near the Sphinx!  They'll blow us apart! \nQuail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself. He rapidly but carefully inspects each vehicle as they pass.  Camera tracks rapidly with them. \n", "test3_id": 893}

At one point they fight with gloves which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool. Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head. There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes it off. \nA boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping.

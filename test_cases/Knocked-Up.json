His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating. \nQUICK IMAGES: \nWe see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool. Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head. There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes it off. \nA boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked. Beer is around. \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - A DIFFERENT DAY \nBen and roommates ride a terrifying rollercoaster. \nINT. ALLISON'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nALISON SCOTT, pretty, 24, wakes up to her radio alarm. \nINT.

Pete enters the kitchen. \nKNOCKED UP - 2. \nDEBBIE I need you to take the kids to school this morning. \nPETE Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out. \nDEBBIE What? \nPETE I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel now, he'll charge me. \nDEBBIE Well, you didn't tell me. \nPETE Yeah I did. Last week, I told you. \nDEBBIE You didn't tell me. \nPETE I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to. \nDEBBIE No, you didn't tell me. \nPETE I did tell you. \nDEBBIE Well, you didn't, but what are we going to do? Because I have an appointment so you're taking the kids to school. Pete holds Charlotte in front of him. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Don't use the baby to cover your tracks. \nALISON I can drive them. I'll drive them to school. \nPETE Thank you very much. \nDEBBIE Great. Good. You turned my sister into a limo driver. \nALISON I don't mind. \nPETE \n(TO CHARLOTTE) It all worked out! \nKNOCKED UP - 3. \nINT. ALLISON'S CAR - DAY \nAlison drives the kids to school.

We'll talk about the Middle East and maybe an idea of an exit strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch. Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe? I don't understand the young talent in this town! It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway! No one stands up. No one has the balls to sit them down and say, \"Look, just cut the shit.\"But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says... \"Cut the shit.\" And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating. \nALISON You know what? You want us to just come and get you when she gets here? You want to head to the green room for a minute?

One of them: Gym membership. \nALISON You want me to lose weight? \nJACK I don't want you to lose weight. \nJILL We can't legally ask you to do that. \nJACK We didn't say lose weight. \nJILL No. \nJACK I might say \"tighten.\" \nALISON \"Tight.\" \nJACK A little...tighter? \nJILL Just like toned and smaller. \nJACK Don't make everything smaller. I don't want to generalize that way. Tighter. \nJILL We don't want you to lose weight. We just want you to be healthy. \nKNOCKED UP - 10. \nALISON Okay. \nJILL You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty. \nALISON Twenty. \nJILL And then weigh that much. \nJACK Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there. \nINT.

No one wants that. \nPETE That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant. \nBEN You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that? \nPETE Probably. I'd hide you. \nBEN How much do wedding rings cost? \nPETE It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring. \nBEN That'll be easy. I don't make any money. \nPETE Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn. \nKNOCKED UP - 71. \nBEN God, it's not porn?

Why didn't you think of that, Jay! \nJAY Don't put this on me! \nBEN God damn it! \nMARTIN Well shit. I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots. \nJONAH What are we gonna do now? \nBEN All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already. \nJASON \"Spiderman Three\" starts in eight minutes. \nKNOCKED UP - 72. \nJONAH Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it out. Jonah, Jason and Martin exit. Ben and Jay sit at the desk. \nBEN You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs. \nKNOCKED UP - 76. \nPETE (back as Pete) Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window. \nDEBBIE What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same. \nPETE No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it. \nDEBBIE You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously. \nPETE Do you want to go to India? \nDEBBIE No. You can go. \nBEN I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about...

I kept thinking that. Alison stares at Ben. \nBEN (CONT'D) It was a flash! \nALISON What do you mean? \nBEN Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, \"Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?\" No part of you would think, \"Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?\" You never got that flash? \nALISON No. What are you talking about? \nPETE \"Where we're going, we don't need roads.\" \nKNOCKED UP - 77. \nBEN You wouldn't do that? \nALISON I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about? \nBEN Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine. \nPETE Everyone has a time machine image. \nDEBBIE I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other? \nPETE Who needs a time machine? Ben holds up his drink. \nBEN This is my time machine! \nPETE \n(TO BEN) I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88. \nBEN \n(TO PETE) You are a funny motherfucker, man. \n(TO DEBBIE) How can you fight with him? I just want to kiss his face. He's cute. \nPETE \n(TO BEN) I like the way you move. \nBEN This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time. \nEXT.

Ben stops. \nBEN I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby. \nALISON That's ridiculous! \nBEN No, it's not. It has no shell. \nALISON Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works! \nBEN I weigh over 200 pounds. \nALISON Just get over it. \nBEN I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis. \nALISON Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine. Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops. \nALISON (CONT'D) I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins. \nBEN You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny. \nKNOCKED UP - 79. \nALISON And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic. \nBEN \n(WHISPERING) Do you want to do it doggie style? \nALISON No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog. \nBEN I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind. \nBEN (CONT'D) Here we go. Is it good? \nALISON Yeah. \nBEN (CONT'D) California. Hey! \nKNOCKED UP - 83. \nINT. BEN'S HOUSE, BEN'S BEDROOM \nBen and Alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed among other things. Alison finds Ben's bank statement that indicates he only has only \nBEN You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, \"Don't move to Northridge.\" But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? Alison picks up a huge sword. \nALISON What is this? \nBEN It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben noticing. \nCARD: 28 WEEKS LATER. \nINT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nBen's phone RINGS. \nBEN Hello? \nINT.

I don't want to do that. \nALISON Ben, come on. \nBEN He's not cheating on her. \nALISON How do you know? \nBEN I just know. \nALISON Are you sure? \nBEN I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating. \nALISON Are you really? \nBEN No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat. \nALISON Why? \nBEN Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome? \nALISON Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little? \nINT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nAlison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner. \nPETE I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance. \nBEN Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls. \nPETE They're incredible. \nKNOCKED UP - 85. \nBEN They really aren't good, man. \nPETE Old Steely Dan. \nBEN If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP. \nPETE I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there. \nBEN That's true. \nPETE And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band. \nDEBBIE Okay. Have fun. Ben exits. \nBEN You guys are crazy.

Wait here. \nKNOCKED UP - 86. \nBEN I just feel bad for Pete. \nALISON What? \nBEN I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this. \nALISON Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating. \nBEN (through a fake cough) Pete! \nDEBBIE I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) You're not the only one. \nPETE It's not that big of a deal. \nDEBBIE \n(THROUGH TEARS) I like Spiderman. \nPETE Okay, so let's see \"Spiderman Three\" next week. \nDEBBIE I don't want to go see it now. \nPETE Well... \nDEBBIE I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own. \nPETE What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do? \nKNOCKED UP - 90. \nDEBBIE You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean. \nPETE I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest. \nJUST-- \nDEBBIE No, you're not. You're lying. \nPETE I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit. \nDEBBIE You know what?

Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed. \nBEN It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny. \nALISON What's funny about it? \nBEN Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation. \n(MORE) \nKNOCKED UP - 91. \nBEN (CONT'D) We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh. \nALISON Is that what you think? \nBEN Yeah. \nALISON Is that what you want to do, Ben? \nBEN I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from. \nALISON Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man. \nBEN Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that? \nALISON You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong! \nBEN So if you're wrong, I have to support it? \nALISON Yes! \nBEN I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic? \nALISON Oh, that's helpful.

He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere. \nPETE You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow? \nJONAH Totally. \nPETE That's awesome. \nJONAH Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed.

I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off. \nPETE That's right. \nBEN In front of a crowd, baby. \nPETE This is better.

Okay. Let's relax. Do you want to talk about things? I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did. I can't believe I said some of that.

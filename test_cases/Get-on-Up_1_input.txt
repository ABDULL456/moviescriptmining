SYD We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number! 
CLOSE UP: Big two inch tape magnacorders turn on brushed aluminium spindles. Recording live. 
Ben Bart looks over at James at the curtain edge. A man possessed. 
BEN BART I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane. 
James looks at Bobby. Bobby nods. James nods back. The band vamp. 
JAMES Watch me. 
The curtain opens. BANG! James Brown & the New Revue are in perfect timing looking impeccable in their new sapphire blue suits. The crowd goes wild with excitement. 
Mr. Dynamite steps on stage-- and floats and dances across bare planks like they were polished ice. He reaches the mike. 
JAMES (CONT'D) You know I feel alright. (Yeah!) You know I feel alright children. (Yeah!) I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight. 
Les Buie whacks the guitar strings and the world ceases to spin. A rising 6/8 blues riff pulses up like adrenaline. 
As he sings the song, a shock wave blasts out from the stage of the theatre on 125th street and into the Universe. 
Bobby might as well be sitting on the moon.    He never misses a beat. 
CUT TO: 
James Brown and the New Revue are tearing up their second number, "Think." 
SYD NATHAN now sits in the audience surrounded by a SEA OF BLACK FACES. We gather that Syd has never really experienced "The Show". He smiles and nods to the beat. 
Just then a female seated behind him shouts as the horns kick in. 
FEMALE IN AUDIENCE Blow it fuckers!!! 
James stares into the darkness. He's already begun to sweat. The drums stop a six punch combination from the horns dead. He reaches for the mic without looking. Leans in and locks eyes with Syd. 
JAMES Think...Think...Think...About your bad self... 
James drops to his knees. The crowd goes wild. 
A few rows behind Syd, we find Susie Brown sitting in the audience. James' mother has come to the show. 
INT. APOLLO DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT. 
After. The cheers still ringing out. People packed into his dressing room. Champagne corks pop. Congratulations from all. 
JAMES Thank you. That's very kind of you. 
Bobby, at the door. Can't get to him. Turns to Gertrude. 
BOBBY Gertrude. Get everybody out. 
GERTRUDE What? 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
JAMES We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. 
BOBBY Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown. (Then) ...James. 
James stops. Turns to face Bobby's grave expression.     Bobby whispers in James' ear. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother. 
James stops dead. COMPLETELY STILL. We push in. He doesn't blink. 
FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET. NIGHT.      1942. JAMES 9 YRS 
Little Junior walks Twigg street at night. Passing dives and joints. 
Suddenly he stops, across the street, he sees a woman coming out of a bar arm in arm with a BLACK SOLDIER. 
He follows her up the street. She's weaving and laughing with the drunk soldier. 
JAMES Momma? 
SUSIE and the soldier walk into a side yard where a party is in full swing. 
James approaches her from behind. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Momma it's me. It's me. 
She turns. Focuses blearily. 
SOLDIER You know this little nigger? 
For a moment it looks as if there is a flicker of recognition. Then swivels her head to look at the soldier. She shakes her head. 
SOLDIER (CONT'D) Beat it. 
YOUNG JAMES But Momma! 
The soldier picks up a rock a throws it. 
SOLDIER Get the fuck out of here. 
92    INT. AUNT HONEY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 1942                        92 
Aunt Honey and James lie in bed together.   James has been crying.

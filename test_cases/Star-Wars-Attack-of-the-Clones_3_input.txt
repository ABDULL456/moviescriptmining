ANAKIN To find my mother. 
PADME No, Annie! 
CLIEGG She's daed, son. Accept it. 
ANAKIN I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive. 
ANAKIN turns abruptly. 
EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME. 
ANAKIN You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe. 
OWEN Take my speeder bike. 
PADME Anakin... 
PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by. 
ANAKIN I trust you'll watch over her, Owen. 
OWEN Don't worry. 
ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires. 
ANAKIN I won't be long. 
ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go. 
EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it. 
INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT. 
JANGO FETT Nearly there, son. 
JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly: 
BOBA FETT Dad, look!! 
On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN. 
JANGO FETT Hang on! 
The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT. 
EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through. 
Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids. 
In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by. 
BOBA FETT Dad! Watch out! 
JANGO FETT Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this. 
But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them. 
IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid. 
IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid. 
BOBA FETT Got him! Yeahhhhh! 
JANGO FETT We won't see him again. 
BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis. 
EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed. 
EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

She cranes back for a kiss, keeps toweling her hair in the mirror. He hugs her from behind, buries his face in her neck. Drained. \nKELL Shit day? \nNICK Shit day. Better now. (pause) How's she doing? \nKELL Fine. She drove me a little crazy today. \nNICK She was busy? \nKELL In overdrive. Here.

And I did something I didn't want to do. \nKELL You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or shine him on. \nNICK None of those things. \nKELL So you had your reasons. You did what you had to. It's not your fault the world sucks. \nNick smiles, eases his face to her belly. \nNICK You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If you're asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now... \nKELL What is wrong with you? \nNICK ...plus there's shit you don't need to know about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna's entire back catalog. \nKELL Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously. I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby's coming out. \nNICK (weighs that) Okay. I'm sure you heard that. Then again there are the Beatles. 70's funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to miss those. (beat, getting serious) All right, kid. Bring it on.

I saw a rocket               * fired.                                             * (to Davies and Dunnigan) Clyde does have somebody on the outside. \nMAYOR                                * What you saw or think you saw is                   * beside the point.

Your job is hanging by a thread.

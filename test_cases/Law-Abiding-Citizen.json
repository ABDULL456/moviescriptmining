Images and sounds are surreal,          1 dreamlike, disturbing: \nA HAND is trying to dial three simple numbers. Trembling fingers miss, try again...we hear boop-boop-boop. \n911 OPERATOR (filtered) 911 operator, what is your emergency? \nThe phone rises, gripped tightly. Knuckles white. We're TIGHT, it's dark, we see no face -- just slack, trembling lips. \nWhoever it is, he can't talk. All we hear is breathing, all we sense is grief and panic and deep shock. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) (filtered) Hello? Can you hear me? Can you speak? \nCLYDE ...eyes... \nOPERATOR (V.O.) What? Can you speak up? \nCLYDE ...her...eyes... \n2   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                                2 \nLights appear like phantoms over blacktop, flashing. Police cars coming our way. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Sir, what is the nature of your emergency? \nThe man can't speak. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Sir? Are you injured? Do you need medical attention? \nThe cars blast by us... \n3   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                               3 \nTIGHT ON PHONE AND MOUTH: \nCLYDE ...her eyes...she can't... \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                            2. \n4   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                4 \nPOLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION, dreamlike. Doors fly open, COPS jump out, weapons drawn as WE MOVE with them to: \nFront door. RAMP TO NORMAL CAMERA SPEED as it opens, revealing: \nBENSON CLYDE, phone still gripped. He barely registers the weapons aimed at his face. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HIM, as: \nCLYDE She can't...close her eyes. \nHe's pulled from frame. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, following COPS into the house... \nDark as hell inside. And tense. Arms training weapons. Moving up a tight hallway, emerging into... \nTHE LIVING ROOM \n...where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns. Furniture shattered and overturned. A kid's sneaker. \nThe flashlights play across TWO BODIES in the wreckage -- a woman's pale hand, a child's motionless leg. \nCAMERA DRIFTS AROUND to the cops' faces, as: \nCOP #1 (unsnaps shoulder radio) Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full response, 11-41. \n5   EXT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       5 \nChaotic now, vehicles and lights. The eye of the storm is Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and grief. He's screaming at the sky, but no sound is coming out. EMS TECHS enter shot, steal the frame, race toward the door... \n6   INT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT                                       6 \nTRACKING SHOT at floor level, photos being taken. FLASHES bathe the foreground wreckage. FORENSIC TECHS step gingerly. Uniformed cops hang grimly back, hugging the walls... \nCAMERA BRINGS US TO CLOSEUP: A PROFILE IN DEEP SHADOW in the foreground, face tilted obliquely in the wreckage. \nA CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the IMAGE FREEZES. A TEN YEAR-OLD GIRL, eyes open, staring at us. \nCLYDE (V.O.) (prelap) Her eyes. That's how they were. Open like that. You see? \nWHITE   -    9-7-8                                           3. \n7   INT. CITY HALL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                            7 \nClyde is seated, speaking slowly and precisely. ANGLE WIDENS, revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as: \nCLYDE When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open. (pause) The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that? \nNICK (O.S.) Yes. Yes, I can. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                        6. \nNICK You were top of your class at Yale, don't give me that shit. \nCANTRELL Young lady. Someday you might have our jobs. You know the issues of                      * the case before the court. Speak. \nSARAH Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row. It's a no-brainer.                      * You make the deal.                                    * \nREYNOLDS                               * (smug, to the men)                            * Duh.                                                  * \nThey trade a look. Cantrell glances to Sarah.                      * \nCANTRELL When the day comes that you argue a real case in court, you might refrain from summing up with \"duh.\" \nSARAH                                   * I'll avoid that.                                      * \n10   INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY                                      10 \nJUDGE LAURA BURCH presides. Nick, Cantrell, Sarah are present.    * CLARENCE DARBY is the focus, Bill Reynolds at his side.           * \nJUDGE BURCH                             * The agreement has been vetted by both sides? Satisfactory to all? \nREYNOLDS Yes, your Honor. Defense approves. \nCANTRELL State also approves, your Honor. \nNick places a document before DARBY, along with a pen. \nNICK Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused. In return, you will be (MORE) \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                           7. \nNICK (CONT'D) shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes. But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering. \nREYNOLDS You'll do a maximum of five years. With good behavior, you could be out in three. \nJUDGE BURCH That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation. \nDARBY Your Honor need not worry on my account. I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I've been given. And I am deeply grateful to all concerned. \nNick gives Cantrell a glance, both stoically enduring this proceeding. Darby pulls the document closer. \nDARBY If I may. It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading                   * lies about me to the tabloid press.                   * About certain alleged activities of                   * which I have no knowledge. Sexual and otherwise. Libel and slander...yes? \nNICK (dryly) You can always sue him. \nDARBY Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court, under oath. His tongue will wag in hell. \nHe puts pen to paper, looks to Nick. \nDARBY He'll get the chair? \nNICK We don't do chair. We do needle. \n11   INT. CITY HALL - GRAND INTERIOR STAIRCASE - DAY                   11 \nCathedral-like, pigeons fluttering. The door from the hallway opens and BETSY, a months-old GERMAN SHEPHERD PUPPY, bounds toward us on a leash pulling Cantrell toward the top of the vast marble staircase. Nick trails them, nervous as hell: \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         8. \nNICK Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.                          * \nCANTRELL I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it. \nNICK You're shitty on stairs. At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down. \nCANTRELL No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you, not somebody else. \nCantrell starts down. Nick's at his side, hovering and ready to grab him, jumping at every little lurch Cantrell makes. \nCANTRELL That's the whole point of this phase. She needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life. \nNICK I'll pass. \n12   EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY                                     12 \nNick and Cantrell emerge into daylight and find Darby in the protective custody of a FEDERAL MARSHAL on the courthouse steps, surrounded by a crush of REPORTERS: \nDARBY ...it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled... \nThey catch sight of Bill Reynolds, the defense attorney. \nCANTRELL Bill! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps? \nREYNOLDS Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you shy away from publicity? \nNICK Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom. \nBLUE   -     9-19-08                                        9. \nREYNOLDS He's your boy too now. You tell him. \nReynolds proceeds down the steps... \nNICK Asshole. \nNick and Kell asleep. She's no longer pregnant -- it's now ten years later. A long beat of quiet... \nA small face peers in from the hallway. EMMA, their 10 year- old daughter. She darts in, puts her face to Nick's. \nEMMA (whispering) Dad? \nNICK Huh? Wha--? \nEMMA You know what it is? \nNICK What? \nEMMA (hollering) IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY! \nShe jumps up on the bed, bouncing up and down and dancing around, hollering at the top of her lungs: \nEMMA IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! \nNick and Kell are too groggy to do anything but ride it out. Emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door, hollering all the way up the hallway: \nEMMA I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY! \nNick and Kell are left groping with blankets, heart rates, and consciousness: \nKELL Glad it's once a year. \n17   INT. KITCHEN/BREAKFAST AREA - MORNING                             17 \nNick and Emma finishing breakfast, getting ready to leave, Kell packing Emma's lunch at the counter: \nEMMA Why can't you be here? \nNICK It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       13. \nEMMA But it's... (draws sneakily close) ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY! \nHe claps his hand over her mouth. \nNICK I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me? (she nods, he lets go) We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock                    * yourselves out, don't give mom any                  * grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay? \nEMMA Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than... \nShe's doing that \"sneakily drawing close\" thing again. Nick holds up his finger, cautioning her to say it quietly. \nEMMA (leans in, whispers) ...my birthdaaaaay. \nKELL Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab                       * backpack. We go.                                    * \nEmma grabs her stuff, kisses dad, races from the room. Kell grabs her keys to follow, kisses Nick goodbye. \nNICK Nice evasion. Thanks. \n18   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK                                         18 \nCars are traveling an old service road... \n19   INT. TOWN CAR - DUSK                                           19 \nNick's in back with Cantrell. The years have left Cantrell 90% blind; his glasses are beyond Coke bottle-thick. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         14. \nBetween them sits Betsy the German shepherd, now ten years old, wearing a guide-dog harness. She looks miserable wearing a big cone-shaped POST-SURGERY COLLAR. \nNICK How long she have to wear this stupid thing? \nCANTRELL Till the stitches heal. Week or two. \nNick dotes on the dog, they're old pals: \nNICK Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head. \nSARAH There they are. Like clockwork. \nANGLE SHIFTS TO Sarah -- much more confident and power-suited than last time we saw her -- riding up front with the driver. \n19A   EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING - GEORGE HILL PRISON - LATE DAY          19A* \nThe car pulls up to the gate as CAMERA RISES to reveal the         * new facility positioned right next to the old one...               * \n20    INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT                                    20 \nThe condemned, RUPERT AMES, is placed against the upright execution table and buckled in. The table is tilted back to vertical. All Rupert can do is lay there and watch, as: \nMEDICAL TECHS swab his arms with alcohol, prepare the needles, find his veins. The needles are inserted, taped off. The I.V. lines are attached. Very methodical. \nThe techs leave the room. The curtain is drawn aside, revealing the big window that separates the chamber from: \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          15. \n21   INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT                                         21 \nNick and his colleagues are among SEVERAL DOZEN WITNESSES seated in chairs. They watch as WARDEN IGER faces Rupert. \nDUNNIGAN Let's not guess, let forensics do its job. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       18. \nCANTRELL                               * How could the chemicals be switched? We're in a goddamn prison!                           * \nNICK                                   * I'll ask because somebody has to.                    * Is there any chance, no matter how remote, that this was an accident? A mix-up? Weird shit happens? \nA beat of awkward silence. The warden hesitating. \nSARAH Show them. The bad part. \n23   INT. PHONE JUNCTION ROOM - NIGHT                                23* \nDunnigan brings our group in. ELECTRICIANS huddle at an array    * of circuits and trunk lines. In the dancing flashlight beams:    * \nDUNNIGAN                               * Some kind of bypass on the phone                     * lines. \nNick sees a CIRCUIT-BOARD spliced into the wiring. \nDUNNIGAN                               * Twenty minutes before the execution,                 * the prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails. Cell service went                  * dark too. Signal was probably jammed. \nSARAH                                  * The bad part. I was just on with the Governor's office. He commuted Rupert Ames' sentence. They were trying to call us to stop the execution. They couldn't get through. \nNick and Cantrell are stunned as this sinks in. \nDUNNIGAN The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls. \nCantrell removes his glasses, rubs his eyes. Softly: \nCANTRELL Oh, fuck me. Fuck me. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       19. \nDUNNIGAN                                * One more thing.                                       * \nDunnigan aims his maglight and swings the junction box cover all the way open. Scrawled on the inside of the door in red are the words: \"HIS TONGUE WILL WAG IN HELL.\" \nDUNNIGAN This mean anything to you?                            * \nCAMERA PUSHES IN on Nick... \n24   EXT. PRISON YARD - PARKING AREA - NIGHT                          24 \nNick's LAPTOP sits on an unmarked car, streaming the D.A.'S DATABASE by wireless. Nick taps the keys, as: \nNICK Clarence Darby. That's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight. \nDUNNIGAN \"His tongue will wag in hell.\" Those very words? It was ten years ago. \nSARAH I remember it too. Some things stick in your head. \nNICK Check the court transcripts, they're public record. \nDARBY'S MUGSHOT (ten years ago) scans up, along with pertinent    * info of that time. GARZA, Dunnigan's partner, peers at it.        * \nGARZA                                   * I know this prick. I'm pretty sure                    * he's one of our C.I.s. \nSurprised looks are traded. \nDUNNIGAN You think, or you know? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       20. \nGARZA That's not the name he uses now.                    * But I'm pretty sure he's one of Bernstein's informants. \nDUNNIGAN Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything he's got, including an address. We roll with tactical. \nNICK How about I ride-along? Give you a fast, accurate ID on this guy? \nCANTRELL Is that necessary? \nNICK You said yourself we should move fast. This thing'll be all over the morning news cycle. We'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then. \nOff Cantrell's look... \n25   EXT. BRIDGE/CITYSCAPE - NIGHT                                   25 \nAERIAL SHOT: ANGLING DOWN to find a CONVOY OF POLICE VEHICLES speeding across a bridge. \n26   INT. UNMARKED CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT                              26 \nGarza driving. Dunnigan riding shotgun. Nick in back, putting    * on a tactical vest. A transmission comes over the car's          * dashboard computer: a MURKY NIGHTTIME SHOT OF A MAN in           * sunglasses and Hawaiian shirt.                                   * \nGARZA That's him. \"Wayne Dunlap.\" \nDUNNIGAN Is that Clarence Darby? \nNICK I think so. Hard to tell. \nDunnigan scrolls the classified police data pertaining to the informant: dates, number of convictions attributed... \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       21. \nDUNNIGAN Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein loves him. \nDUNNIGAN STAY DOWN! \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          24. \n31   EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                     31 \nDarby runs like an amped-up rat in a maze, hearing cop cars in the night: Engines ROARING, tires SQUEALING... \nSuddenly, the SOUND OF A HELICOPTER above. Darby dashes for cover against a garage, lost in shadow. A massively bright searchlight sweeps from above, probing... \nDarby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight scan over rooftops. His phone RINGS, he answers: \nVOICE Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints. \nDARBY Kiss my ass. \nVOICE I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo? \nDarby glances at the gun, realizing. He bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration -- fuck! \nVOICE You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that. \nDarby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as: \nVOICE You'll need my help getting out. \nDARBY What'll it cost me? \nVOICE We'll discuss terms later. Go south, across 10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic. \nDARBY What's there? \nVOICE A cop. Take his ride, he won't give                    * you any trouble. \nDARBY How do you know? \nVOICE 'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         25. \nClick -- line dead. Darby breaks cover, heaves the gun into somebody's yard, keeps moving... \n32   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       32 \nChaotic with cops and lights. Lisa is dragged out, shrieking and bleeding, her face a broken mess. ANGLE TO Nick watching it all unfold. He sees Dunnigan approach: \nDUNNIGAN No way he's getting out of this neighborhood. \n33   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                               33 \nDarby finds a POLICE CRUISER parked in the moonlight, window down. Dark inside. A LOCAL COP is sprawled across the front seat...groaning, coming to. \nDarby jumps in, passenger side, wrestles the cop upright. He yanks the cop's service revolver, slapping him awake. \nDARBY Drive. \nDarby reaches over and keys the engine to life. \nDARBY Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains on the dash! \nCOP (disoriented) Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay? \nDARBY Depends on you. Go. \nThe cop hits the gas. Tense moments go by as they accelerate up a dark road. Darby ducks as COP CARS stream past. \n34   EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       34 \nDunnigan and Nick tense, hearing a VOICE over the radio: \nCOP VOICE (heavily filtered) ...air unit three...see no sign of suspect...think we lost him... \nDUNNIGAN (keys mic) Keep sweeping the area, unit three. (to Tactical Commander) Go house-to-house. Check everything.                  * Garages, dumpsters, storm drains...                   * \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                        25A. \nNICK                                  * You gotta be kidding me.                            * \nDunnigan -- angry, at a loss -- doesn't reply. Cops are          * scrambling in all directions.                                    * \nNick turns, steps TOWARD CAMERA INTO A TIGHT SHOT, gazing off    * into the darkness. Something very weird just happened here,      * but he has no idea what.

INDUSTRIAL ZONE - NIGHT                                      35 \nTracks and factories, remote and deserted. Far away, the POLICE COPTER is still buzzing, searching... \nThe police cruiser appears, stops. Darby emerges with gun and      * flashlight leveled, motions for the cop to get out. The cop        * complies with hands raised, shaking. \nDARBY In the ditch. \nCOP ...please...don't kill me... \nTHE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK... \nFADE TO BLACK \n...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES... \n40   HOLD IN BLACK.                                                   40 \nTHE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking up as the lid is opened. A FIGURE in a meat-packing coat looms over us, faceless and scary behind a dark face protector. \nANGLE INTO TRUNK                                                   * \nreveals OFFICER HILTS hand-cuffed and duct-taped.

He leans down, slits the tape binding Hilts' arms, drops the keys in the cop's hands. \n41   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAWN                                   41 \nThe police cruiser sits on a dirt road, a FEMALE DISPATCHER'S VOICE issuing softly and incessantly from the radio: \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          30. \nFEMALE VOICE ...unit twenty one, come in...unit twenty one, please respond...report your location... \nThe mysterious figure strides from the police cruiser to a MIDNIGHT BLUE 1965 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL in superb condition, shrugging off his thick coat. He gets in, hits the gas. \nHilts struggles to uncuff himself in the cruiser's trunk,          * arms and legs cramping, as:                                        * \nThe Lincoln becomes a CLOUD OF DUST receding in the distance...    * \n42   INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MORNING                                     42* \nCleaning up the aftermath of the party: Nick up on a step- stool taking down the birthday banner; Kell in her robe feeding the dishwasher; Emma zooming in and out shuttling paper plates and plastic cups into a big trash bag... \nEMMA ...and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face... \nKELL I saw it coming. \nEMMA ...and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny... \nShe's out of the kitchen to grab more stuff. Kell starts preparing a bowl of cereal for Emma. \nKELL Funny for her. I cleaned it up. \nNICK I had my \"ewwww gross\" moment last night too. \nKELL Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls. \nNICK Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve. \nKELL Honey. It's not a competition. (off his look) Okay, you win. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                        31. \nEmma re-enters, dumping more trash: \nEMMA ...so Tara says that's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again... \nThe DOORBELL RINGS. Kell glances out the window. \nKELL Delivery. \nEMMA (grabs her cereal) I'll get it! \nShe runs out. Nick comes off the step-stool, gratefully accepts a cup of coffee from Kell. He suddenly freezes, notices: \nThe kitchen TV is playing CNN: a top-of-the-hour story on the Rupert Ames execution and foul-up. \nNICK Oh, shit. We've gone national. \n43   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                            43 \nAt the front door, a MESSENGER hands Emma a GIFT BASKET trailing mylar balloons with \"Happy Birthday Emma\" on them. \nEMMA Thank you! \nShe closes the door, turns toward us, finds a CARDBOARD ENVELOPE on the basket -- a card? She opens it, finds: \nNot a card. An unlabeled DVD. \n44   EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAY                                      44 \nLOCAL SHERIFFS (not city cops) are spreading out across the        * fields, beating the grass, looking for clues... \nANGLE TO Officer Hilts, blanket-draped and still rattled by his night-long ordeal, being interviewed by a SERGEANT: \nSERGEANT ...the suspect who tasered you last                    * night...was it the same person who                     * let you out of the trunk this morning? \nHILTS I never saw a face...either time...he wore a thing, a face shield... \nSuddenly, we hear a DISTANT VOICE shouting in panic: \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          32. \n56   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             56 \nA GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing: \nBenson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue... \n57   EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                       57 \nVEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just above them at scary-low altitude... \nThe cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing... \n58   INT. CARS - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                                  58 \nTense faces: Dunnigan, Garza, Nick. \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                           35. \n59   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             59 \nClyde pauses, hearing a RUMBLE under the music. Glances up as the rumble passes overhead -- a helicopter? He clicks on a tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry. \n60   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             60 \nA shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out, machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans... \n61   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             61 \nClyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan, leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window. \nHe glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals... \nHe holds up the figurine for a final look. Satisfied with it, he places it onto: \nA CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand- painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here. \nHe stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons. \nHe positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting. \nThen, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting: \nSWAT TROOPS DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS-- \nClyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains serene, looking around at them, hands raised high... \nSWAT CAPTAIN ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW! \nHe compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread throughout the house yelling \"Clear!\" \n62   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              62 \nNick, wearing his kevlar, follows Dunnigan and Garza. Nick glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln Continental in the carport... \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          36. \n63   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              63 \nClyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde... \nDUNNIGAN Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent... \n...as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them... \nDUNNIGAN ...understand your rights as I have explained them? \nCLYDE Yes. \nClyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like. \nNick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help admiring the pieces. Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books. \nGARZA (O.S.) Check this shit out. \nNick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal: \nThe long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps. \nANGLE WIDENS to reveal: \nPhoto after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them. \nTHE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns     * TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells: \nDUNNIGAN CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE? \n64   INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                              64 \nClyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up. \nSARAH He says he'll only talk to you. \nWHITE   -    9-7-8                                         37. \nNick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the VIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as: \nIGER It's not just a bed. Every inmate               * here will be on the phone to their              * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can you justify that?                * \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       47. \nSARAH                                  * (offering) We give him a bed, he confesses, we                  * take the bed away.

Order the bed. \n71   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                             71 \nClyde watches as MAINTENANCE MEN remove the unbolted cot from the cell and his Sleep-Matic is rolled in. \nCONVICTS watch, dumbfounded. Clyde's cellmate, a towering Aryan Brother named DWIGHT DIXON, stands quietly amazed... \nCLYDE (V.O.) (pre-lap) Switching the drugs was easy... \n72   INT. \"THE DOME\" - DAY                                           72 \nBack in the birdcage: \nCLYDE I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why. \nNICK And the prison phones? \nCLYDE Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work. (off Nick's look) It's a system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       48. \nNICK (beat) I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He suffered terribly. \nCLYDE Score. \nNick flips to a new page on his pad. \nNICK Let's move on to Clarence Darby. \nCLYDE (sits back)                                   * Hey, you like music? \nNICK (hesitates)                                   * Very much. Why?                                      * \nCLYDE I could tell. I love music. All of                   * it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs. \nReactions all around the room. Iger leans forward: \nIGER Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no.                       * \nClyde absorbs that, looks to Nick, as: \nNICK It's a legitimate concern. \nCLYDE (beat, calls to Iger) How about my ipod and speaker dock? \n73   INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY                              73 \nAN IPOD AND SPEAKER DOCK now occupy a small plywood shelf attached to the railing outside Clyde's cell. A GUARD plugs it in via a long orange extension cord. \nANGLE WIDENS to Iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to Clyde. Dixon's watching balefully, as is every inmate on the cellblock. \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                        49. \nIGER The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable. \nCLYDE I appreciate your compromise. \nIger draws close to the bars. Quietly: \nIGER You looking to get your ass kicked? (off Clyde's look) By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly. \nClyde glances back to Dwight. Dwight's watching, glowering, agreement in his silence. Clyde turns back to Iger. \nIGER Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all. \nIger walks away. Clyde aims the remote. MUSIC STARTS PLAYING. He leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed. Cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him. \nCLYDE (O.S.) (pre-lap) I took his fingers with a bolt cutter. His toes with a pair of tin snips. His balls with a hacksaw... \n74   INT. \"THE DOME\" - DAY                                           74 \nCLYDE ...his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes...for those I used my fingers. (looks to Nick) Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it. \nNick trades looks with the others in the room -- everybody have what they need? People nod. Nicks closes his pad. \nCLYDE What now? \nNICK My office types it up, you sign. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       50. \nNick rises, putting things in his briefcase. People get ready to leave -- but Clyde motions Garza to keep it rolling. \nCLYDE How about a signing bonus? The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing...why not give me a reward for signing? \nNICK You don't want to sign, don't sign. We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, I'll attend your execution. I'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs. \n79   INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY                                          79 \nNick enters, moves through the bullpen. ADAs (assistant district attorneys) are working and grimly focused. Nick pokes his head into Sarah's office. She looks up. \nNICK What do we have so far?                                * \n80   EXT.

THE SPOOK eases partially into the light -- flinty gaze, military-style haircut. \nSPOOK You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde. \nNICK What are we dealing with? \nSPOOK Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge. \nThe guys trade a look. Cantrell can't help chuckling. \nCANTRELL (to Davies) You gotta be kidding me with this guy. \nSPOOK He's not. Tell me you grasp the implication of what I've said, or we're done here. \nCANTRELL (smile fades) Yeah. Okay. I get it. \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                    67. \nNICK What was Clyde? Some kind of spy? \nSPOOK Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people. (off their looks) You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do? \nNICK Ask Clyde? \nSPOOK That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it. \nNICK How good? \nSPOOK (beat) You play chess? \nNICK Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact. \nSPOOK In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game. \nNICK What about Clyde? \nSPOOK Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet. (further into the light) This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       68. \nNICK I have been. Any thoughts? \nSPOOK Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does. \nDAVIES Like what? He's locked up. What can he do? \nSPOOK (gives him a look) You're an average chess player, aren't you? \nDAVIES Actually, I kind of suck. \nSPOOK I can tell. But I like your tie. \nDAVIES (perplexed) Thank you. Father's Day. \nSPOOK There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but                     * trust me it works. You put your tie                 * on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point. (beat) Clyde invented that. \nThe Spook melts back into the shadows. The guys crane forward, trying to see. There's a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes...he's gone. \nThe three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard. Nick sits on a step. Quiet looks are traded... \n...and they all start taking off their ties... \nJAMESON No, Miss Lowell. \nSARAH (crossing the room) Weekend plans? Cancel 'em! I don't wanna hear any shit about it! (on Jameson again) Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          72. \nJameson dives onto the keys, starts clack-clacking. Sarah gives Nick a nod -- she's got this in hand. Nick exits... \n119   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - NIGHT                                       119 \n...and finds a FORENSIC TEAM disassembling Clyde's Sleep-Matic bed -- nuts, bolts, struts, electronics. The mattress is being razored open, wadding pulled out and run under fluoroscopes. \nNICK Well? \nDUNNIGAN It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed. Now it's not. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS them to a table where an FBI TEAM is focusing all their skills and tech on Clyde's ipod and speaker dock. The TEAM LEADER places the buds in his ears, listening. \nNICK What do you have? \nTEAM LEADER Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh. (off Nick's look) What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod. \nThe other agents snicker, not hiding their amusement, but:         * \nNICK                                     * Tear it apart, make sure. Memory.                      * Speakers. Wiring. Everything.                          * \n120   INT. CLYDE'S CELLBLOCK - NIGHT                                    120 \nGUARDS, FEDS, BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS -- they're cruising the cellblocks, flashlights swiveling, beams catching the faces of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars... \nWe find Nick and Iger at Clyde's now-empty cell. TWO FBI            * emerge, shake their heads.                                          * \nFBI FORENSIC Blood stain. Few fibers. That's it. \nCONVICT (sleepy, at his bars) Warden, man, whassup? \nIGER Everybody back to sleep. \nNICK (looks to Iger) I want to see him. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          73. \n121   INT. SOLITARY WING - CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                         121 \nTwo doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door. The outer slides aside, reveals Nick outside the bars. Inside stands a shadow, waiting: Clyde. \nCLYDE You're up early. Trouble sleeping? \nNICK It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring                    * my family half to death. Done. \nClyde moves closer to the bars, into the light. \nCLYDE Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?                        * \nNICK                                     * You strip away all the polite shit,                    * that's what we're really about. \nCLYDE                                    * I hope you never face what it is to                    * lose them, Nick. It's like dying yourself. There's nothing worse. \nThat could play as a threat, of course -- but it's not. It's       * genuine. And pained. And sincere. And Nick knows it. \nNICK Good night, Ben. \nCLYDE Good night, Nick. \nAnd then the moment's gone and the mocking Clyde returns: \nCLYDE Is it casual Friday? (off Nick's look) I've never seen you not wear a tie. \nAnd that says volumes: Clyde's totally aware of what they've been up to and is tickled by it. \nThe outer door GRINDS SHUT... \n122   EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - DAWN                                        122 \nNight has passed, day is coming. All the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. People straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles... \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         74. \nNick, Dunnigan, Davies, Iger -- all look whipped. Sarah approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm. \nSARAH We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip. \nIGER Well, that's good news. \nNICK So far. Now we double-down. Make                    * absolutely certain.                                 * (nods after ADAs)                            * Let them all sleep a few hours,                     * then bring 'em back for round two.                  * \nSARAH Due diligence. My middle name.                      * \nShe trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their vehicles. Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody coming down from a tense night. Davies shakes their hands: \nDAVIES Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance. \nDUNNIGAN Love it when they cry wolf. \nThe men separate in different directions. Dunnigan catches a glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze. \nROYCE We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city... \n133   EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY                                 133 \nKell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, CROWDS swarming around them as boarding calls come over the P.A. system. Kell is looking around, anxious. \nNick appears on the platform, hurrying. They see him. Emma runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches. \nEMMA I wanna see Sarah... \nNICK Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it. \nEMMA This sucks. \nNICK I know. \nEMMA Why do we have to go? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       85. \nNICK 'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that? \nEMMA You're kinda full of shit, Dad. \nNick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh. He trades a look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care. \nNICK Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us. (directed at Kell) I mean it. Okay? \nEMMA Okay. \nShe detaches from her father. Nick rises to Kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her... \nNICK No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash. \n...then takes her cell, swaps it for Royce's... \nNICK I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me.                           * \nP.A. VOICE FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR NEW YORK CITY DIRECT, FINAL CALL... \nKELL Anything else? \nNICK I love you. \nKELL Emma's right.

Nick stands, watching them get on the train. The doors close. The train starts out... \nNick turns. Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for what Nick's going through... \n134   INT.

AERIAL SHOT OF TRAIN - DAY                                   135 \nWE FOLLOW the train traveling a path through canyons of buildings, leaving the city... \nANGLE SWAPS TRAIN FOR CAR as we drift over a bridge and find Nick's car racing across the span...                                * \n136   INT. CANTRELL'S HOUSE - DAY                                       136 \nNick and Garza enter. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the house swarming with HIGH-TECH FBI FORENSIC TEAMS turning the house upside-down, tearing things apart, X-RAY SCANNING walls... \nCantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him. He glances up, hearing: \nNICK Jesus.                                                 * \nCANTRELL Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush. \nDavies enters frame, accompanied by FORENSIC TECHS -- not the guys from downtown, but people who work serious ops. \nDAVIES We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker... \nHe holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes, runs a black-light wand behind it -- dark granules become visible on each pass, embedded in the ice. \nDAVIES I'm betting something lethal. \nTECH #1 Like this salt. (pours a small amount) Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table.                      * \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                 87. \nNick tosses the others a grim look.                      * \nNICK I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him. Someone on the outside. \nCANTRELL Who? Who could he have? \nNICK Somebody from his past. Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit... \nNICK Something like that. \nCLYDE Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback? \nNICK No. It's to prove a     point. (off Clyde's     look) Just because I have     the power, doesn't mean I have     to use it. \nCLYDE Ah. Nice. Good one. \nNICK One can show mercy. \nCLYDE Mercy. Right. \nNICK Yeah. So why don't you? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       91. \nWe see Clyde's brain bend a little -- trying to wrap his head around it. It's almost painful for him. \nCLYDE I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber? \nNICK Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you. \nCLYDE (smiles \"right\") Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with                  * it. You don't just stop because                    * someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you. \nNICK Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said... (beat) ...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago? \nCLYDE I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both. \nNICK I'd have lost. \nCLYDE With your head held high. And without any blame from me. \nNick's CELL RINGS -- he turns away, answers: \nNICK Yeah... (beat) She is? Great news. I'll stop on my way back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. Thanks. (hangs up, baleful) Six hours in surgery. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                  92. \nCLYDE But she's okay -- good. Miss Lowell is a fine young woman. (beat) Oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right? \nNICK (beat, staring) You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose. \nClyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh. \nCLYDE Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe. (reproachful) C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway. \nNICK No? \nCLYDE There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster. \nNICK What kind are you? \nCLYDE Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world. \nPause. Drawing close: \nCLYDE It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back. \nNICK Yeah. \nCLYDE Imagine knowing they wouldn't. \nNICK I can't. I can't imagine that.               * \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                        93. \nCLYDE Good. I envy you. For me, knowing                     * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would. \nNICK I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won. \nWe see Clyde's brain hurting again -- he's trying to believe that, would like to believe that... \nCLYDE Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could. (pause) Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go? \nSilence now. Nothing left to say. They turn and walk in opposite directions... \n140   INT.

A WALL-MOUNTED TV IS PLAYING A NEWS REPORT of the explosions -- file footage of Jonas Cantrell pops up. Nick drifts over, sits at her bedside, as: \nREPORTER ...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price... \nThe IMAGE cuts to the Mayor stepping to the mic. \nMAYOR Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion... \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                       103. \nNick MUTES it. He and Sarah don't speak for long moments -- he's waiting for her to pull herself together. \nShe finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her laptop and files and reports around her. \nSARAH We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here-- \nNICK Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done. (off her look) I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career. \nSarah is staring at him with \"fuck you\" in her eyes. She picks up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him. \nSARAH This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two. \nNick, not caring, scans down to: \nNICK \"Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage.\" Went out of business in '94. (looks up, irritated) Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone? \nSARAH (tight, pissed) The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location. \nNick looks down at the list again...staring... \n175   EXT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - DAY                           175 \nA shitty garage in a shitty industrial park. Bordering it, on the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks. \nNick's car pulls up. He gets out. It's a ghost town here. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                        104. \nHe goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt. He wipes with his sleeve, but it doesn't help him see in. \n176   INT. GARAGE - DAY                                                 176 \nTIGHT ON ROLL-UP DOOR -- a CAR JACK jams in under the lip. We hear CRANKING and the door rises... \nNick drops down, peering in. He squeezes under the door, stands up. Gloomy in here. He hits the door switch -- it RATTLES up       * on its tracks, flooding the place with light...                    * \nHe looks around. Cobwebs. Dust. A CAR under a tarp on the hydraulic floor-lift. Old shelves and pallets of tools. Rust. Grime. The crap of ages. \nHe sighs, turns and walks out... \n177   EXT./INT. GARAGE - DAY                                            177 \n...and pauses. Something tickling his brain. \nSuddenly, a SHRIEKING COMMUTER TRAIN blasts by -- gone, dwindling. It was a bizarre, distinctive sound...like the one Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde. \nNick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening to fall into place. Something about the shape of that car under that tarp... \nHe turns, staring at it. Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners... \nHe draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental, midnight-blue, in excellent condition. The last time he saw it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse. \nWhat's it doing here? More pieces falling into place. Nick leaves the garage again, walking out... \nCAMERA TRACKS HIM across the tarmac, and as we come around the corner of the building, we reveal: \nThe County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater corner of the prison not sixty feet away... \nNick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed. \n178   INT. GARAGE - DAY                                                 178 \nFar below us, the van emerges from the same door, comes out of the alley and back onto the street... \nVOICE #2 (V.O.) I got a white van...large cube type...think he switched vehicles... moving north again on Hudson... \n189   INT. DUNNIGAN'S CAR - NIGHT                                       189 \nDUNNIGAN Five and six, stick with that building in case he's trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van... \nDunnigan pulls out into traffic, resuming the tail... \nVOICE #3 (V.O.) I have visual on van. Logo on side reads \"Nomos Custodial Services.\" \nNICK Where the hell is he going? \n190   EXT. CITY HALL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                             190 \nThe glorious old building looms above us. TILT DOWN to reveal a red carpet event brewing -- LIMOS AND LUXURY CARS pulling up, GUESTS in expensive attire getting out... \nThe NOMOS VAN STEALS THE FRAME as it drives past and turns to go around the back of the building... \nA LIMO STEALS THE FRAME BACK as it pulls to the curb. The Mayor steps out, waving and smiling for FLASHING CAMERAS... \n191   INT.

CITY HALL SERVICE AREA - NIGHT                             193 \nA GUARD mans the security desk -- he glances up from a BANK OF LIVE-FEED VIDEO MONITORS as Clyde rolls his cart in. \nSECURITY GUARD Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around. \nCLYDE Ted...had to get that vacation in. Visited my sister in the Keys... \nSECURITY GUARD Nice. Good for you. \nCLYDE Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance? \nSECURITY GUARD Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing. Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come. \nCLYDE (moving on) I'll stay out of their way. \nSECURITY GUARD (calls after him) They're up on six, avoid that floor.

AERIAL SHOT LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN - NIGHT                  194 \nFar below: The entrance lit up with arriving cars and guests, CAMERAS FLASHING... \nA HELICOPTER DRIFTS through the shot just below us in SLOW- MOTION, rotors thrumming eerily... \n195   INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                   195 \n...while Clyde rides up. He stops at five, gets out... \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         109. \n196   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                              196 \n...and rolls his cart up the hallway. MUFFLED MUSIC from the floor above. He comes to a door, sorts his keys... \n197   INT. EMPTY COURTROOM - NIGHT                                      197 \n...and enters in darkness. Moving swiftly, he reaches into his trash barrel, pulls a gleaming STEEL BRIEFCASE from under the shredded papers -- he strides to the judge's dais, lays the case atop it, turns and heads back to his cart... \n198   INT. SERVICE AREA SECURITY DESK - NIGHT                           198 \n...as a STREAM OF TACTICAL COPS stampede into the building and up the stairs. ANGLE FINDS Nick, Dunnigan, and Davies looming over the nervous security guard: \nDUNNIGAN What floor? \nSECURITY GUARD I told him to avoid six... (checking monitors) There... \nOn a monitor: Clyde rolls his cart from the courtroom... \nSECURITY GUARD That's the main courtroom on five.                     * \nNICK That's right below the ballroom. The Mayor's event. \n199   INT. 6TH FLOOR HALLWAY AND BALLROOM - NIGHT                       199 \nEarly arrivals are coming up, entering the ballroom.

JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - NIGHT                         208 \nThe garage door rises. The Lincoln backs in, stops on the hydraulic lift. Clyde gets out, throws the tarp over it. \nBriefly checks his clamshell. Still plenty of time... \nHe raises the lift a few feet, drops down and crawls under the car into: \n209   THE MECHANIC'S PIT                                               209 \nDuplicate controls. He hits the button and the car sinks down atop us, settling to the floor, sealing us into darkness. \nWHITE   -   9-7-8                                         113. \nBeat. A BRIGHT LIGHT turns on -- one of those gazillion candlepower flashlights. Clyde aims it and we see: \nA TUNNEL hewn into the wall of the mechanic's pit. Just large enough for Clyde to crawl into. He does... \n210   INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                              210 \nHand-dug, rough dirt held up by two-by-four bracing. A wheeled platform is the transport -- Clyde's on his back, pulling himself along by an overhead rope, hand over hand... \n211   INT. UNDER THE PRISON - NIGHT                                    211 \nClyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub-basement laid into a foundation that dates back to the Civil War. He crawls free, shining his light as rats scurry in shadows... \nHe's on his hands and knees at first because the ceiling's so low. He's finally able to rise, moving along at a crouch... \n...and emerging into a proper sub-tunnel. Now able to walk normally, he navigates the tunnels and comes to: \n212   INT. CLYDE'S STAGING AREA - NIGHT                                212 \nWe're just below the solitary wing. Clyde has it rigged with all his needs: computer, spare cell phones, various kinds of clothing, even a shelf lined with snacks. \nHe quickly shrugs off his custodian's outfit, revealing his prison jumpsuit beneath. He gazes up a welded steel ladder (identical to four others in a row -- one for each cell). \nHe checks his clamshell one last time, tweaking the bad reception with a relay -- ballroom looks full. He clicks off his lamp and clamshell, sets them on a shelf... \nHe goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling... \n213   INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT                                        213 \n...and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet. In deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts inputting a number -- boop...boop...boop... \nAnd he freezes. Realizing... \nThere's somebody in there with him...a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door. The figure reaches out, pushes open the outer door a bit. Faint light spills in, revealing: \nNICK I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                      114. \nCLYDE Imagine mine. \nNICK Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary --                  * pre-rigged with exits from all five               * cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered. (faint smile) I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted. \nCLYDE That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea. (beat) You came to talk, so talk. \nNICK Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point. \nCLYDE But it happened. And here we are. \nNICK Here we are. (beat) Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us.                       * \nCLYDE You want to hold hands? What's your point? \nNICK We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be. (beat) What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what? \nClyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad. \nCLYDE If I don't? What are you offering? \nNICK You looking to deal? \nBLUE   -     9-19-08                                       115. \nCLYDE I'm willing to listen. \nNICK Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal. (off Clyde's look) I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you                  * taught me. Strange as it sounds,                   * I'm grateful for the lesson.                       * \nNick rises, steps out -- pauses, turns back. \nNICK Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life. \nThe moment stretches. Clyde poised -- all down to this. In        * the end, he can't help himself: Boop-boop-boop -- hits send.      * \nCLYDE I'm sorry. \nNICK Me too... \nNick pushes the barred door shut... \nNICK ...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is... (glances at watch) ...another 35 seconds. \n...and turns the key in the lock -- klatch. \n", "test1_input": "NICK You think you can play us? You gonna take me on? \nCLYDE Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you. \nNick advances, furious, held back by Dunnigan: \nNICK I'm gonna bury you, fucker! \nCLYDE (lunges to his feet) That's it, that's what I want! That fire in the belly! That's what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me! \nDUNNIGAN (shouting at Clyde) Sit down! Sit the fuck down! \nClyde does, settles in, speaking calmly: \nCLYDE Or. Set me free. \nNICK What? \nCLYDE Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way. (off Nick's look) I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                  41. \nNICK You're gonna confess. \nCLYDE Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep.

Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves. \nNICK Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw. \nCANTRELL Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child. (off Nick's look) Public sympathy is to be respected and feared. This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind. (stops) Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax to grind? \nNICK No. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                          42. \nCANTRELL Then stop acting like it. \nBeat.

Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals... \nSARAH How about outside help?

But try to limit their hours, okay? \nWe find a MERCEDES at the curb -- Kell at the wheel, Emma in back. Nick gets in. Sarah leans down, happy to see them. Emma's face lights up -- the little girl obviously adores her. \nKELL Well, hello there beauty! \nSARAH Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo? \nEMMA Hi, Sarah! \nKELL We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit? \nSARAH Who needs a life, right?

Seriously, we miss you. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       43. \nSarah blows Emma a big extravagant kiss. Emma returns it, waves as they pull away. Nick and Kell glance back, happy to see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self... \n67   INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       67 \nLate. Nick, in t-shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes. He comes to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob... \nEMMA'S BEDROOM \n...and finds the bed empty. Sheets thrown back. \nNick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had washing over him. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM fast down the hallway... \n...into the master bedroom, where he finds Emma sleeping with Kell. He stands for a moment, heart hammering. Softly: \nNICK Fuck. \nKell stirs, sees him, puts a finger to her lips. In whispers: \n", "test1_true": "KELL She had a bad dream. She wanted to sleep with us tonight. \nNICK (feels his heart race) Jesus. \nEMMA (stirs) Daddy...? \nHe climbs onto the bed, cuddles up, Emma between them. \nEMMA I had a nightmare.

In the center of the floor stands a smaller free-standing domed cage, like a bizarre birdcage. \nInside the birdcage: Nick and Garza wait. Garza mans a camera. \nOutside the birdcage: Observers. Some (Cantrell and Sarah) occupy floor-level, where the video monitors are. Others (Iger and Dunnigan) are on a catwalk above that encircles the room. \nA door opens and Clyde is brought into the birdcage. He gazes around, checking his surroundings. \nCLYDE I admit I expected something more modern. That jail downtown?                        * \nNICK Filled to capacity. It has been for years. They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway.                   * \nGARZA Welcome to the county jail annex.                  * All new inmates come here.

You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames. Yes? \nCLYDE We'll get to that. First, what I'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It's lumpy. (off Nick's stare) Hardly any padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable? \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       45. \nNICK I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done. \nCLYDE Start with things I haven't done. Like get any sleep last night.

Nick tosses his legal pad on the table, swivels around in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk, spreads his arms in a \"help me\" gesture. \nNICK Anybody? \nDUNNIGAN It's a steel cot! It's bolted to                  * the wall!                                         * \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                   46. \nCLYDE I'm sure they have a wrench.                    * \nIGER We also have rules prohibiting                  * personal items such as beds.                    * \nCLYDE (looks to Nick) Let me get this straight.

(to Clyde) My daughter slept in our bed last night. She hasn't done that since she was six. You gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don't feel like cutting any little deals today. \nCLYDE My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence                  * Darby's breath in her face.

They move toward us with purpose, grim and resolute, Sarah bringing up the rear with a young ADA named ROYCE. \nNICK Why do you have him in the dome? \nIGER He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him out. \nCANTRELL What's wrong with solitary? \nIGER We don't have the authority. Not without a court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual. Especially solitary. (off Nick's look) It was nicknamed the dungeon... \nNICK (to Sarah) Get Judge Burch on the phone. \nSarah speed-dials as a GUARD lets them in... \n106   INT. \"THE DOME\" - DAY                                             106 \nClyde waits in the birdcage, shackled.

Didn't see that one coming. \nNICK Why'd you kill your cellmate? \nCLYDE I claim self-defense. \nNICK Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him. \nCANTRELL Which makes it premeditated. Again. \nCLYDE And, again, you'll have to prove that in court. As I've said before... (to Nick) ...make your case. Or set me free. \nDAVIES (pissed, moving forward) Your booby-trap killed two of mine            * and put four in the hospital.

I have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do I not, Detective Dunnigan? \nDUNNIGAN That is correct, Agent Davies. \nDAVIES (again to Clyde) So. I'm gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear. \nCLYDE (beat, glances to Nick) You see, Nick? That man is pissed!

A GUARD is spraying WD-40 into the lock of a cell, trying to turn the key. It finally does, as: \nClyde is brought in.

He's isolated, for God's sake. \nNICK Let's keep him that way. Strict rules apply. Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets. Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever. \nDUNNIGAN You think it was a bluff?                              * \nNICK We underestimated him before. I'd like to know what this prick is capable of.

He's toying absently with his wine glass. \nKELL Where are you? \nNICK (catches himself) Million miles away. Sorry. \nKELL Don't be. This guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he? \nNICK Yeah. I guess he is. (she expects more) It's...killing his cellmate. I need that to make sense. \nKELL Why? Happens in prison all the time. \nNICK Yeah, I know, but...we're not talking some gang-banger. This man is precise. Does things for a reason. \nKELL He's psycho. You said so yourself. We saw it on that video. Psychos don't need a reason, Nick. They're just psycho. (off his look) Whatever. You'll figure it out. You                  * always do. \nNICK (smiles) Thanks.

Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead. \nClyde leans down, right in Cantrell's face, intense: \nCLYDE I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far... (shouts) ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED! \nBeat. Cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with rage. Clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all: \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       78. \nCLYDE If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw. \nDUNNIGAN Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now. (looks around) Fourteen people dead! I have to say                  * this out loud? (moving toward Clyde) Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard.

(off Dunnigan's look) Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The \"shit like that?\" \nNick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control. He steps in, seizing the moment back: \nNICK Put the gun away! Are you crazy? \nDUNNIGAN (calmly reholsters) It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out. \nNICK We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down. (to Clyde) You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       79. \nCLYDE I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family. (re-buttons) So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline... \nNICK What? What then? \nCLYDE I'll kill someone in this room. \nThat sucks the air out of the conversation -- everybody stares as that sinks in. Glances are traded. \nNICK Who? \nHe looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if trying to pick. He points his finger, starts going from one end of the group to the other... \nCLYDE Eenie...meenie...miney...moe... \n...from person to person, to the end, moving back again... \nCLYDE ...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is... \nHe lands on Cantrell.

We'll tap in and monitor every call. \nDUNNIGAN Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at... (checks his watch) ...about 7:30 tonight. \nCANTRELL Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker. \nNICK No way. Find a replacement. \nDUNNIGAN Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable. \nCantrell isn't happy about it -- but nods. \nNICK And have them switch the location of that dinner. \nCANTRELL That's last minute. \nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                       81. \nNICK Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit.

UNIFORMS are stationed in the hallway. Garza pushes a path through: \nGARZA Keep the press off this floor, understand? \nNick squeezes past. The floor is busy. He finds Kell in the waiting area. She looks up, spots him. \nKell rises. She and Nick pull into a tight embrace. No words for a long moment. Kell's shaken, fighting tears. \nNICK Any word? \nKELL She's in surgery now. They're saying she'll be okay. \nNICK Thank God. That's good. \nKELL Good? You'll have to explain the good part, Nick. I'm missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you? What would I say to Emma? What would we do? \nNICK You didn't lose me. You won't. Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class? \nKELL I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up. Nick -- and for you. I want to do something... \nNICK You are.

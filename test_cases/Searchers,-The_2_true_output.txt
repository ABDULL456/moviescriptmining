EXT. BURNING INDIAN VILLAGE - WIDE ANGLE - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY 
as they ride in, passing dead horses, a few bodies of men. 
MARTIN'S VOICE Trouble of it was that the soldiers had hit when most of the fightin' men was away -- huntin' maybe... So most of the dead was old men and women an' kids... And it was in one of the tepees Ethan found her -- the little squaw who wanted me to call her Look... 
Ethan has dismounted in front of one of the tepees, heads inside. 
INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT - DAY 
as Ethan enters. A body -- Look's -- is sprawled on the ground. He crosses, turns her over. Martin enters behind him. 
ETHAN Well, you're a widower now... 
MARTIN (angrily) What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!... 
He sees something clutched in her hand. He stoops quickly. 
MARTIN Ethan! 
Ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses. 
Martin shows him what Look had been clutching -- Debbie's rag doll. 
MARTIN Look! It's hers, Debbie's... 
Ethan snatches it, stares at it. Then he turns and runs from the tepee. Martin stares at Look's body, then covers it with a robe. 
MARTIN'S VOICE So we knew Debbie had been in the village... What Look was doing there -- whether she'd come to warn them, or maybe to find Debbie for me... there's no way of knowing... 
He turns and then slowly heads out. 
EXT. THE TEPEE - ETHAN AND MARTIN 
Ethan stands there, his expression bleak, looking at the scene. Martin joins him. 
MARTIN We gotta catch up with them yellow legs... Maybe they got her with them. 
Ethan isn't thinking of that at all. 
ETHAN (harshly) And maybe they got Scar! 
They start away -- fast. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SNOW COUNTRY - WIDE ANGLE - THE CAVALRY AND PRISONERS - DAY 
A long line stretching across the landscape -- women falling and being prodded along by their captors. From behind CAMERA ride Ethan and Martin and move to intercept the column. 
EXT. THE COLUMN - FULL SHOT - DAY 
as Ethan and Martin come closer and look at the shawled prisoners stumbling along. 
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY 
as a young OFFICER spurs out of the column and rides toward them. 
OFFICER (inquiringly) Yes? 
ETHAN We're looking for a girl -- a white girl... 
MARTIN She'd be about thirteen now... 
OFFICER We got two around that age... 
MARTIN (eagerly) Where? 
OFFICER You'll have to wait until we reach the agency... Fall in behind the column... 
MARTIN (protestingly) But couldn't you...? 
OFFICER Sorry... (shouting it) Keep the column moving!... Close ranks there! 
The officer spurs out to rejoin the column. Martin looks at Ethan, his face alive with hope. But Ethan is just looking stonily along the line of passing prisoners. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. THE NOKONI AGENCY - WIDE ANGLE - DAY 
The column of cavalry and prisoners enters the agency (COLORADO FOOTAGE). We see the dead and wounded on travois; the agency Indians watching stoically; the prisoners -- some of them -- being herded into a chapel. 
INT. OFFICE OF NOKONI AGENCY - FULL SHOT - DAY 
The office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters. The GENERAL is being interviewed by two Eastern newspaper CORRESPONDENTS. At a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending out a report of the victory. 
A pot-bellied stove supplies heat and the General is warming his hands at it, intermittently. An adjutant is rather wearily filling out a long official form. 
The General, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well-known glory hunter of the Indian wars. He wears a colonel's straps, but insists upon his brevet rank. 
GENERAL And it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one... with all the advantage of terrain... 
CORRESPONDENT Four to one! What did you do, general? 
Ethan and Martin enter, stand in the doorway. 
GENERAL (impressively) Sir -- we charged!... Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp... 
ETHAN (blurting it) Cheyenne! What Cheyenne? 
GENERAL (turning and staring) I beg your pardon?

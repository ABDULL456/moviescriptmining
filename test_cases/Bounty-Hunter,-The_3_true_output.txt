MILO/CASS It's our third anniversary! 
DAWN/EDMUND Congratulations! 
MILO/CASS Thanks! 
Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot. 
INT LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING 
Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by the fire. 
And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled, being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters: 
EDMUND To begin: a little aphrodisiac! 
He gives them both a broad wink. 
MILO (GRIMLY) Wow. 
CASS (SAME) Great. 
EDMUND So tell me: how have you managed to keep the romance alive all this time? 
MILO Well, I'll tell you, Edmund. The secret to our success is that the little woman here knows her place. She cleans for me, cooks for me, and every night when I come home she gets down on her knees and massages my feet. 
He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth. 
CASS Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage his feet to help him feel like a man. It's important, especially when your husband has such a teeny tiny... 
Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting: 
DAWN How is everything? Is it like that magical night 3 years ago? 
CASS Uh-huh. 
MILO Yup. You betcha. 
DAWN This calls for a toast! 
She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass both groan under their breath. 
DAWN (to the room) May I have your attention please? Edmund and I would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen. It was three years ago today, in this very restaurant, when this lovely young man here, right in the middle of the meal, threw down his napkin, got down on one knee, and said marry me, right now, right this second, I want to go to sleep tonight knowing you're my wife! 
EDMUND (jumping in) And she said yes, with tears in her eyes and a tremble in her hand, let's get married, and they ran out to the all night chapel and came back an hour later, man and wife! 
The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund: 
MILO Can I get a whiskey? 
CASS Make that two. 
INT LUXURY B&B HALLWAY- NIGHT 
Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically, falling down drunk. 
MILO After we broke up, I was so mad at you, I told everyone I know you have herpes. 
CASS I told everyone you flunked out of 3rd grade. 
MILO I told everyone you have a moustache. 
CASS I told everyone you like to wear my panties. 
MILO Hey! 
This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder. 
INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT 
Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here. 
The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then: 
CASS Wow. This would be really awkward if we still had feelings for each other. Which we don't... 
MILO That's right. Luckily, we're different people now. We don't feel the way we used to. 
CASS Right. We've moved on. 
MILO We have no feelings about each other whatsoever. 
MILO Just two people who used to know each other. 
CASS Two casual acquaintances.

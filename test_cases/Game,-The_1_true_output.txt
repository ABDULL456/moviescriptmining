88.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 
The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success. 
89.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly.  He's up to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner, he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found in the dumpster.  He takes a deep breath and-- 
90. SUBMERGES.  UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window handle hole... a perfect fit.  He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN. 
91.  U N D E R W A T E R   S H O T  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window.  Cheeks puffed out, he kicks frantically for the surface. 
92.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T 
He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him. 
GIRL Mister-- are you all right?! 
Schuyler, treading water, turns around-- 
A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby.  A very beautiful GIRL in a yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her. 
93.  E X T .   C A B I N   C R U I S E R  -  N I G H T 
SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth CHATERING.  HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the stern:  "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL." 
SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft. 
SCHUYLER Thank you... I'm very grateful. 
GIRL Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you could get hepatitis. 
Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock. 
SCHUYLER I have to get in touch with the police. 
GIRL You're freezing, I got some dry clothes below. 
94.  I N T .   B O A T   C A B I N  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes. 
GIRL Do you need any help? 
His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat-- only a STRING BIKINI beneath.  She could be a Playboy centerfold. 
SCHUYLER Uh, no.  I'm fine.  These fit... (buttoning his pants) ...perfectly. 
He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her. 
GIRL Sure I can't do something for you? 
She WINKS as she lets her top drop.  Schuyler smiles strangely. She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms.  He GRABS her by the hair.  Menacingly: 
SCHUYLER I am finished playing. 
GIRL OW!  Let go! 
She pounds at him, tries to kick.  He wrestles her to the floor, kneels on top of her.  He seems about to hit her. 
SCHUYLER This has got to fucking STOP! 
GIRL You're hurting me! 
SCHUYLER Who are you!? 
GIRL I just got hired to show you a good time!  C'mon please get off me... 
Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself.  He climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself. 
GIRL I am not into this kinda shit! 
SCHUYLER Who hired you. 
GIRL I don't know, the service set it up. 
SCHUYLER The service? 
GIRL Y'know, Fantasy Girls.  They said you had this wild fantasy, I should just wait in the boat... 
Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her, pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin. 
95.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf.  The girl, pulling the raincoat on, leans over the deck. 
GIRL Doncha want your thing?  I'm supposed to give you this, this key thingie... 
Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches. 
SCHUYLER A key. 
THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid.

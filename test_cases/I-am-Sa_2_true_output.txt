SAM "They perched in sisisi..." 
LUCY "Silence." 
SAM "...silence for a long time."  Boy. Your teacher chose a hard book this time.  "How can we be so difdifdif..." 
LUCY "Different." 
Sam glances up at Lucy self-consciously.  Lucy grabs the book from Sam, tosses it on the pile and picks up another. 
LUCY (CONT'D) I don't like that book - let's read "Green Eggs and Ham". 
Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized than read. 
SAM "I am Sam, Sam I am.  Do you like green eggs and ham?  I do not like them, Sam I am!" 
They both laugh, delighted.  Lucy looks sleepy. 
MATCH DISSOLVE: 
Lucy is getting drowsy.  Sam is just getting started. 
SAM (CONT'D) "And I will eat them here and there. Say I will eat them ANYWHERE.  I do so like green eggs and ham, thank you thank you, Sam I am!"  One more time! LUCY Daddy, I have school tomorrow...I don't wanna be too sleepy. 
SAM Just the part about the boat and the goat in the rain in the train? 
LUCY Daddy, Hamburger Hamlet has twelve different kinds of hamburgers.  Can we go there Wednesday instead of Denny's? 
SAM But Wednesday night's Denny's, Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night Karaoke. 
Lucy nods, a little deflated. 
SAM (CONT'D) How about one more time, just the beginning?  "I am Sam, Sam I am..." 
Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from "STELLALUNA". 
MISS WRIGHT Lucy, your turn.  Start where Sara left off...Lucy? 
LUCY I can't. 
MISS WRIGHT Sure you can. 
LUCY "They perched in sisisisi..." 
MISS WRIGHT Silence. 
LUCY (throws down book) There.  I told you.  It's too hard. 
MISS WRIGHT Lucy!  I know you can read this! 
LUCY No, I can't!  And you can't make me! 
Lucy runs out of the class. 
EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK 
Sam, in sunglasses, waits for the BUS.  A YOUNG WOMAN, LILY, sits down next to him.  The WIND CATCHES her floral dress that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring.  She reads a TABLOID. 
LILY Look here.  "Premature baby claims he's cupid - has the arrow to prove it."  Do you believe that? 
SAM Well, if he has the arrow. 
LILY Yeah.  You got a good point. 
She crosses her legs.  A tuft of pink dress falls on Sam's knee. 
SAM You're a good reader. 
LILY Yeah, I've always been smart. 
SAM You're lucky.  I'm looking for a smart, good mother.

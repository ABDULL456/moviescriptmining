Lupino drops the machine gun. Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper. While Lupino GASPS, eyes wide, Max struggles to his feet. 
MAX Who is your contact at Aesir? 
Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.       Fascinated. 
MAX louder) Who sent you after Michelle? L UPINO (with difficulty) You are so blessed. 
Max looks at Lupino - up close, his undyed skin is ashen and pockmarked, older than his age. Blood drools from his lips. Lupino's eyes swim around, lost in a fog of drugs and pain. 
MAX ou don't know what I'm talking about, do you? 
Lupino's eyes stop swimming.    For a moment, he sees Max. 
LUPINO The angels are not done with you yet. 
Lupino's skull explodes. 
Max spins towards the hall, but another SHOT rakes across his shoulder and slings him to the ground. Defenseless, Max can only lift his eyes to see who's coming to finish it... 
B steps out of the smoke. 
As Max reels at the sight of BB, JOE SALLE (50'S) rumbles in. 
alle stomps on Max's wrist, in the same motion telescoping a metal baton and CRACKING it across his skull. With the grace of an old pro, Salle snaps on a pair of handcuffs. 
MAX (in shock) BB? 
Max is hauled to his feet - bleeding, cuffed, and trapped. 
B 
B 
G 
A 
M 
And BB walks right on by. 
AX What's going on here, BB? 
As Max watches in disbelief, BB paces around the room taking stock - noting the dead Guards, crouching over Lupino's body. B B t ease, soldier. 
Max struggles to break free of Salle's grasp. 
MAX Hey! 
JOE SALLE (draws pistol, re. Max) Now? 
BB Not unless you feel like carrying him out of here. Max knows me, and I definitely don't know Mr. Lupino. 
MAX shouting) Look at me, BB.    At least face what you're doing... 
BB finally does look at Max.    Cold, dead eyes.   A stranger. 
BB row up. 
EXT. RAGNA ROK - NIGHT 
BB steps through the door, over the guard's upturned chair. 
The blizzard has won - streets and sidewalks no longer scraped, cars long abandoned under their icy cocoons. The fifth largest city in the world, reduced to a ghost town. 
B Happy New Year. 
B strides out in front, taking in the sight. It might as well be a desert, white sand sifting around their boots, buildings rising above like black canyon walls. 
Max shuffles along behind BB, head bent low in the wind. Plumes of his ragged breaths trailing out behind him. 
BB (cont'd) Look at it from my perspective: this thing is going to be a true epidemic. One hundred percent dependence within a few doses, and we control the only source. This is so much bigger than Lupino's little bar. This is every street corner in the City in a month, nation wide in two. 
Max keeps trudging, one foot in front of the other. BB looks annoyed that he's not getting a reaction out of him. B B I hope you're not over there blaming me. Really, this is Michelle's fault. 
Max's eyes start to burn.     BB sneaks a peek, encouraged. 
BB She had no right to put me in that situation. Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's unreasonable. 
Max's head snaps up, eyes simmering with rage.     BB smiles. 
BB But then again, who could blame her for getting confused, being married to such a righteous man. So maybe it is your fault, after all. (beat) Just like your old man. Always knew you were better than everyone else--

EXT. TECH PIT 
Sparky smiles. 
SPARKY Great move, Speed. Careful on the butterfly coming up. You may wanna ease up-- 
SPEED Not this time, Sparky. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT 
Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar. They can feel that something special might be happening. 
EXT. TECH PIT 
Sparky checks his stop watch. 
SPARKY Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you're racing? 
CONTINUED: He can see him. 
SPEED Yeah... Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the past. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST 
Rex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission, dominating the race exactly like Speed. 
EXT. GRANDSTANDS 
Pops stands watching the race through binoculars Young Spped is beside him. 
YOUNG SPEED Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops? Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He goes back to his binoculars. 
YOUNG SPEED (CONT'D) He's gonna win it. He's gonna set the course record. Nobody's gonna catch him. 
POPS Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race to run. 
YOUNG SPPED No way. It's over. My brother's the best racer in the world. Everybody else is running for second. The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel. 
EXT. CREW PIT 
Blackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief, knotting his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts. 
BLACKJACK BENELLI I told you to take him out! 
CONTINUED: 
CREW CHIEF #1 We're trying, sir. He's just too fast. 
EXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY 
Rex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller- coaster, opening an even bigger lead. As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is someone right behind him, a ghost car-- Speed. As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the present. 
INT. MEDIA ROW - PRESENT 
The buzz is palpable.

EXT. GRANDSTANDS 
in the glass of Pop's binos we can see the dim reflection of the two brothers racing. 
CONTINUED: Pops stands beside Mom. He is still watching the race with his trusty binos though he is now a little older, plumper and balder.. He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same time that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair next to him. 
SPRITTLE Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it, couldn't he? Pops goes back to his binos. 
SPRITTLE (CONT'D) What if he does? What if he does it, Pops? 
POPS Sssh! 
SPRITTLE I don't know if I can watch this... He holds the binos as though afraid to look when-- A hairy hand comes in and takes them away. Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts the binos to his eyes. Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing another cheer. Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her. Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her gut. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET- DAY - PAST 
The little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with a pack of girls, their little mouths as sharp as razors. In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine. 
BLONDE PACK LEADER My Daddy told me he used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit. 
(MORE) 
CONTINUED: 
BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D) My daddy said that was a completely crazy thing to do. He says the whole family is crazy.

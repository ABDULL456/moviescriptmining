Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it. 
Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment -- 
-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion. 
Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears. 
ROSENBERG Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible. 
ARQUILLIAN Your majesty, you are in grave danger. 
ROSENBERG Yeah, and they overcharge you every time. 
ARQUILLIAN Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet. 
ROSENBERG A bug? He must know why I'm here. 
ARQUILLIAN We think he does. (noticing the ornate box on the table) Is that what I think it is? 
ROSENBERG No, just some diamonds for your children. Do we have time to eat? 
The Arquillian relaxes. 
ARQUILLIAN Sure. I ordered you some pirogi. 
INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY 
In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the stainless steel counter -- 
COOK Table six is up! 
-- and turns away, back to the grill. 
A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant. 
The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed tomatoes -- 
-- and a DEAD WAITER, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the shelves. 
INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY 
ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast. 
ARQUILLIAN To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire. 
ROSENBERG To the safety of the galaxy. 
They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down. 
Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of the Waiter's hand -- 
-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand, dumping wine all over the table. 
He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face. 
It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications Edgar's presence holds. 
ROSENBERG (in English again) You can kill us both -- but you will not find it. 
Edgar smiles. 
EDGAR You're right about one thing. 
Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain. 
They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi. 
The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES at him. 
Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's lunch. 
The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table, where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats. 
Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for the door. 
Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes.

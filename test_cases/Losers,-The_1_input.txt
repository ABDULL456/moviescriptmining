ROQUE Shut up. 
POOCH Hurry... 
ROQUE Shut up... 
Third set out, ripping the frame from the window... 
EXT. KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- SAME 
WIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES! Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins. AS WE SLOWLY FADE TO... 
EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT 
A rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes. 
INTERCUT WITH... 
INT. CIA BACKROOM -- NIGHT 
Somewhere secret. Our guys' PERSONNEL FOLDERS. Each being opened. Each being stamped "DECEASED". BACK TO... 
EXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO: 
BLACK SCREEN. OVER IT IN SMALL LETTERS: 
THE LOSERS 
FADE UP: 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 
A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes. 
Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW. 
She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down. 
In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH. Indulging in a nightly ritual... 
EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT 
Mexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them. COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above... 
EXT. DESERT STRIP MALL -- NIGHT Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits. Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT... 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - HOLLYWOOD DOG TRACK -- MORNING 
Hollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused. 
IN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older. But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken. 
Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS, following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns. 
ROQUE (FLAT) You lost again. 
CLAY We lost again. 
Clay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track. 
ROQUE You placed the bet. 
CLAY You gave me the money. 
ROQUE Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it? 
Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's... 
ROQUE (CONT'D) That makes, what, three in a row? 
CLAY Four. 
Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks across the track, towards the PARKING LOT. ROQUE You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds. 
CLAY Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach. 
CLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS. 
ROQUE Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win. 
Clay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales. ROQUE (CONT'D) We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy?

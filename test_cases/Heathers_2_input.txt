J.D. You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly's ass away! 
VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a framed picture of a woman, at the roaring J.D. 
VERONICA You can be so immature! 
J.D. (looking off) You kids are making too much damn noise. 
FRED DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway, holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette. 
FRED DEAN We beat the bitches. 
VERONICA (mumbling) Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home. 
FRED DEAN Judge told em to slurp shit and die. 
FRED DEAN crams the cassette in his V.C.R. and hefts up a chest exerciser. He begins pumping away as the image of a shabby building appears on the massive T.V. 
FRED DEAN I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs. 
The building blows up. FRED DEAN cackles. J.D. politely applauds. FRED pops out the videocassette and bounces away. 
FRED DEAN It's great to be alive! 
VERONICA Do you like your father? 
J.D. Never given the matter much thought. Liked my mother. 
J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw. 
J.D. They said her death was an accident. But she knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew... 
VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern. 
VERONICA Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... 
J.D. Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? 
VERONICA Maybe. 
J.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels. 
J.D. Whoa! Amazing! 
THE T.V. SCREEN 
A music video flashes on the Dead T.V. screen. THREE GORGEOUS WOMEN, stylishly furnished, evocatively wail the female moans heard throughout the film. The video viewpoint then pans to two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy clothes. They sing/shout before an all-white background. A SUPER in the corner reads BIGFUN/TEENAGE SUICIDE (DON'T DO IT). 
BIGFUN (T.V.) TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW! PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW! 
J.D. It's the new BigFun video! 
VIDEO:   INT.   A GIRL'S BEDROOM--DAY 
Now in full screen, the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed and very cute, white, female VID VICTIM ONE sitting at her dressing table. She pours a bottle of pills into her hand. 
BIGFUN (V.O.) BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO! 
BIGFUN magically materialize next to VID VICTIM ONE. The pills in her hand have turned into jellybeans. She is ridiculously happy. 
BIGFUN TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! 
J.D. pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face. 
J.D. We've made MTV. 
J.D. fires into the radiant image of BIGFUN, destroying the T.V. and disgusting VERONICA, who bolts off the couch. He raucously crawls after her. 
VERONICA We're breaking up. I am out! 
J.D. Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor. 
J.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit. 
VERONICA You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. 
J.D. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. 
VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and eventually into a walking-out-the-door position. 
VERONICA I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... 
J.D. Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.

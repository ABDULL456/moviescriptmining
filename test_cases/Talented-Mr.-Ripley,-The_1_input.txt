RIPLEY I've got plans! 
DICKIE Ripley's plans. 
RIPLEY Esatto. I'm always planning. 
DICKIE Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I? 
RIPLEY Why are you asking all of a sudden? 
DICKIE No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? 
RIPLEY Why? 
DICKIE I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. 
RIPLEY Then I'll take it as a compliment. 
DICKIE I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! 
RIPLEY (a beat) Ha. 
DICKIE Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit? 
RIPLEY (conceding, without guile) I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York... 
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love. 
DICKIE I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums? 
RIPLEY What? 
DICKIE So cool. 
He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this - it's superficiality. 
EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY. 
The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor boat. 
DICKIE That's how I found my place in Mongi. Took a boat out round the bay.  The first place I liked, I got it. 
The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by the speed. 
RIPLEY Dickie, slow down, come on! 
Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore. 
DICKIE (ecstatic) I love it here! Gonna live here! 
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich. 
RIPLEY I wanted to tell you my plan. 
DICKIE So tell me. 
RIPLEY I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. 
DICKIE (suddenly tight) Really?  To Italy? 
RIPLEY Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - I'll get a job - or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here - 
DICKIE Oh God, I don't think so.

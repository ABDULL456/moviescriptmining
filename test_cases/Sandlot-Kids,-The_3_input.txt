REPEAT You're dead as a doornail, Smalls. 
TIMMY Nice knowing you. 
REPEAT Nice knowing - 
TIMMY - shut up, Tommy. (STUNNED) Smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here and actually played with it? 
REPEAT And actually played with it?! 
SCOTTY Yeah, but I was gonna put it back. 
SQUINTS But it was signed by Babe Ruth! 
SCOTTY Well, who is she?! 
HAM What?! What?! (OVERCOME) What did he say?! 
DENUNEZ The Sultan of Swat! 
BERTRAM The King of Krash! 
REPEAT/TIMMY The Colossus of Clout! 
GANG BABE RUTH! 
HAM (for good measure) The Great Bambino! 
SCOTTY (that did it) OH, MY GOD! THAT'S THE SAME GUY?! 
BENNY Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but more than a man. Ya know... like Hercules or somethin'. (BEAT) The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth... well, more than your whole life. 
Scotty falls to his knees. Grabs his stomach. 
SCOTTY I don't feel so good. 
They all step back, expecting the worst. Then, they fan him with their baseball caps. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) (HEARTFELT) We gotta get that ball back. 
BENNY When does your old man get home from work? 
SCOTTY He's gone on business for a week. 
BENNY Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash 'em in. We need a new baseball. 
CUT TO: 
A BRAND NEW BASEBALL 
Benny's hand signs B A B E R U T H across the leather in ridiculous chicken scrawl. 
EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY 
Forgery in progress. Benny does the honors. 
DENUNEZ I dunno, Benny-man. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, it's pretty crappy. 
SQUINTS He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn't look anything like the Babe's signature. 
BENNY It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference. This'll just buy us some time, ya dorks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY 
Scotty's HAND ENTERS FRAME. Little anxious FINGERS wrapped around the phony "Babe Ruth" baseball. The second the ball is back on its pedestal: 
MOM (O.S.) Scotty? 
DEN 
Scotty whips 'round like he's been slapped by a wet mackerel - Mom's in the doorway. 
SCOTTY Huh?! 
MOM Honey, what are you doing in here? 
SCOTTY Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean Dad's baseball. 
Scotty hurries away from the "autographed" ball. 
MOM You know he doesn't like you touching his things. 
SCOTTY Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom. 
MOM Has he ever told you about that ball? 
SCOTTY Uh - no, not really, I don't think so - no, he hasn't at all - I don't know _anything_ about it. 
MOM It's signed by Babe Ruth... 
Sweet mother of - Mom knows! Scotty may collapse. 
MOM (CONT'D) ...the greatest baseball player that ever lived. 
SCOTTY Um... really?

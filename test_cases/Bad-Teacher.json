{"test1_input": "BAD TEACHER \nWritten by \nLee Eisenberg & Gene Stupnitsky \nJune 6, 2008 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY \nTo establish. A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads, \"GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!\" A JANITOR opens the glass and starts removing the letters. \nINT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY \nPOP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling. TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note: female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.) PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers. He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Well, it's been another great year here at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus' haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you. SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly enjoying the small compliment. \nSANDY I ain't afraid of no ghost. The other teachers laugh. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Or the wild success of... \nVOICE (O.C.) Wally, can I just say one quick thing? Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students and adults alike -- like students. \nAMY Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over. So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm? That's it. Back to you, Wally. A bunch of teacher roll their eyes. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Thanks, Amy, (then, back to his notes) . Or the wild success of the book drive for the women's prison sponsored by Ms. Savicki's class? A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) But now as the summer is upon us, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty. \n(BEAT) Elizabeth, can you come up here? ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) You've only been with us for one short year, but know that you'll always be a part of the JAMS family. Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile. The Teachers lightly applaud. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) And we got you a little something. Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and. pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37. \nELIZABETH Almost forty dollars. Thank you! \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Why don't you say a couple words? \nELIZABETH Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this type of thing so I'll make it quick. I know I've only been here a year, but there's so much I'm going to miss... \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nElizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing the few personal effects she has into a banker's box. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) My students, probably most of all.I'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher. Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last days of seventh grade. A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she signs it. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nElizabeth walks down the hall holding her box. SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her, running toward their summer vacation. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) And I wish that I had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding, I had my hands full. From the little I do know about you, I know that our students are in good hands. Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes. \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY \nThree middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a thicket on the outskirts of the school property. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) And I can't believe it's all over. This year flew by. And even though I'll never teach again professionally, I've realized that I don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example. Elizabeth comes up behind them. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of the burnouts hands her the joint. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops. \n", "test1_true": "Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in, pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE, and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's box out the window and extends her hand, giving the school THE FINGER. \nELIZABETH (O.S.) Woo-hoo! A couple students look at her strangely. \nANGLE ON The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook. He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of Elizabeth is her message: \"YOU ARE ILLITERATE!\" \nDIM-LOOKING KID (struggling to read) You are... Illit... Illit... Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly hits him. She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic letters to read, \"HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!\" \nJANITOR Slow down! \nCHYRON: BAD TEACHER \nEXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT \nA Mercedes with the vanity plate \"HIS\" is parked in the driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate reads \"HERS.\" \nINT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nA bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive. Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip. \nELIZABETH \n(CALLING) Baby Doll? \nMARK (O.S.) Coming! MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear. He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth. Thankfully for him, he has money. \nMARK (CONT'D) \n(ANXIOUS) Hey! That was a quick party. Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands him a glass. \nELIZABETH Yeah. You should have seen it. What a joke. She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Here's to me never having to work again. And I owe it all to you, Lover. Elizabeth takes a big sip. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) \n(FLIRTATIOUS) So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris, and then I booked us a suite at the Drake, and I thought we could finish the night in \"anal alley.\" Hmm? Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into -- \nINT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nElizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in. \nElizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet, behind the door. \nMARK See? Nothing. Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES. Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands, revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest. \nELIZABETH \n(TO MARK) Motherfucker! \nELIZABETH How could you do this to me?! I'm sorry. \nELIZABETH You are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm talking serious blood diamonds. Sheila SNEEZES again. Bless you. \nELIZABETH \n(TO SHEILA) Get out of my house, bitch! \nMARK Don't talk to her like that. \nELIZABETH Excuse me? I love her. Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's large breasts. \nELIZABETH You love her? She's a hooker. \nMARK SHEILA She's not a hooker. I dance. Elizabeth takes a deep breath. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) \n", "test1_id": 1011, "test2_input": "GARRETT This is called \"The Chase,\" by Garrett Tiara. \n(READING) XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/ Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great? / About her smile / That I would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending. Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps, then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off. \nELIZABETH She sits back down. \nGARRETT We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve... (really reaching for it) Ba-lance... Thank you. He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks to Elizabeth for a reaction. \nELIZABETH Junior likes to rhyme. \nMELODY Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a hand with dessert -- give them a chance to talk about the poem. The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH So your poem's about that girl? \nGARRETT Chase, yeah. You got the subtext. \nELIZABETH Can I give you some advice? \nGARRETT Please. \nELIZABETH Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions. \nGARRETT But I like Chase. \nELIZABETH Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful. \nGARRETT What do you know? You don't-even know our names. \nELIZABETH I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same \"Gymnastics\" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know. \nGARRETT \n(EMOTIONAL) This sweatshirt was my dad's. It's all he left when he left. \nELIZABETH Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it. \nGARRETT (quiet, steely) Fuck you. Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder. \nELIZABETH Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door. \nGARRETT Happy New Year. Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over? She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth. She looks haggard. She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup and takes a long swig. The kids look at each other, like \"what is she doing?\" Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough. \nELIZABETH Shut up. \nINT. WOMEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY \nElizabeth is-checking her makeup in the mirror. Lynn enters. Her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it. \nLYNN Hey, welcome back. \nELIZABETH What is that, vomit? Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain.. \nLYNN Yeah, and a little blood. The kids had too much sugar. \n(MORE) \nLYNN (CONT'D) Anyways, a bunch of us are going out tonight to see Period 5 play. Do you want to come? \nELIZABETH Ugh. No. Elizabeth heads out. Lynn, still blotting, follows her. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nElizabeth and Lynn bump into Scott. \n", "test2_true": "ELIZABETH Um, yes! That sounds like a party. (then, to Lynn) Lynn, do you want to come? \nLYNN Yes. \nSCOTT We'll all grab a drink! \nELIZABETH Great. I need to get drunk. I mean, not drunk drunk. But a strong buzz. Still be able to drive home. \nSCOTT (high fives her) Now we're cooking with grease! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. IN CAHOOTS BAR & GRILL - NIGHT \nWe hear the familiar riff of Shawn Mullin's \"Lullaby.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. IN CAHOOTS BAR & GRILL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nScott, Sandy (with his hair down), a BALDING BASS PLAYER with a yarmulke and a HEAVY-SET DRUMMER, are playing their hearts out. This is PERIOD 5. \nAmy, and a couple other teachers are front and_center, grooving to the music. Amy sways with her eyes closed. \nSANDY \n(SINGING) Everything's gonna be alright / rockabye... Scott joins in, harmonizing. \nSCOTT Rockabye, rockabye... \nSANDY SCOTT Bye, bye... Bye, bye... \nANGLE ON Elizabeth and Lynn at the bar. \nLYNN Aren't they terrific? Elizabeth eye-fucks Scott. She catches his eye and he quickly smiles before nervously turning his attention to Amy. Elizabeth watches Amy dance in SLO M0, her BREASTS bouncing up and down. \nELIZABETH (staring at Amy's breasts) They're perfect. \nLYNN You should hear some of their originals. She turns to the bartender. \nELIZABETH Two more. (then, to Lynn) You want anything? \nLYNN No thanks... You know, I was thinking that if you still need that money, you should.try and go for the bonus. Can't hurt. \nELIZABETH What bonus? \nLYNN For the state test. (off Elizabeth's look) \n(MORE) \nLYNN (CONT'D) Whichever teacher has the highest scoring class gets a bonus. We talk about it all the time in the faculty meetings. \nELIZABETH How much? \nLYNN $5700. Could be good, right? \n(THEN) Let's dance! Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy. \nDRUMMER \n(COUNTING OFF) \nSANDY \n(SINGING \"SMOOTH\") Man it's a hot one / like seven inches from the midday sun... Amy kicks her shoes off, and starts dancing. Lynn follows suit. Elizabeth throws back her drink and exits. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_id": 1012, "test3_input": "ELIZABETH \n(TO HERSELF) You can bet on it. \nINT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nDanni, the receptionist, uncrumples a BALL OF CRUMPLED CASH and counts it. Elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently. \nDANNI Almost done. We don't normally deal with cash here. At the doctor's office. Elizabeth slides the bonus check across the desk. \nELIZABETH And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by. \nDANNI \n(TO ELIZABETH) And when would you like to come in? \nELIZABETH \n(TO DOCTOR) \nMIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR Hi. He goes into his office. Elizabeth turns back to Danni. \nDANNI And when would you like to come in? \nELIZABETH Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar. \nDANNI A week from tomorrow, then? \nELIZABETH Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature. \nDANNI We have a 48 hour cancellation policy. Anything after that, you'll be charged 50% the cost of the surgery -- unless there are extenuating circumstances. \nELIZABETH I wouldn't miss it for the world. Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks down at her breasts. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) So long, suckers. \nEXT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN \nThe lot is empty except for Elizabeth's car. \nINT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nElizabeth enters and pulls latex gloves from her bag. She snaps them on. She takes a seat at Amy's desk and pulls an apple from her bag. Then she pulls out POISON IVY. She rubs the apple with the poison ivy leaves and then carefully places it in the center of the desk. Elizabeth smiles. \nINT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER \nAmy's class is seated. Amy enters and heads for her desk. She notices the apple and smiles at her class, touched. Thank you. The class stares back at her blankly. \nAMY (CONT'D) Who did this? No response from the class. \nAMY (CONT'D) Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra sticker on their all-star board? Amy presses the apple to her ear. \nAMY (CONT'D) (muppet voice, to apple) Who brought you to me? Amy places the apple up to her ear. \nAMY (CONT'D) \n(MUPPET VOICE) What's that, Mr. Apple? You want me to take a bite? Alrighty-roo. Amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class. \nAMY (CONT'D) Enough horsin' around, let's get started. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY \nA LUXURY BUS idles curbside. Parents see off their kids. Scott and Elizabeth are checking kids in. Principal Snur walks up. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR All set? \n", "test3_true": "PRINCIPAL SNUR Elizabeth, thanks again for hopping in last minute. You really saved us. \nELIZABETH Is Amy going to be okay? \nPRINCIPAL SNUR She'll be fine. But to be honest, I think she was scaring some of the kids. \nELIZABETH I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's in my thoughts. \nANGLE ON Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face is completely blistered, scaly and red from the POISON IVY. The kids have every reason to be scared by her. She gets into her car and slams the door. \nAMY (banging on steering wheel) Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge! \nINT. LUXURY BUS - DAY \nKids sing BUS SONGS. Elizabeth and Scott sit up front. \nKIDS \n(SINGING) Hey, Sasha!

Up front, Scott and Elizabeth sit next to one another and share ipod buds. \nELIZABETH (nodding to the beat) You guys are amazing. Period 5 is definitely going to make it. Scott smiles wide. Garrett walks up the aisle. He looks at Elizabeth, then turns to Scott. \nGARRETT Mr. Delacourte, do you think we could go to the poetry museum? \nSCOTT Oh, um, I don't know, Champ, um -- Scott looks to Elizabeth, like \"please help.\" \nELIZABETH (to Garrett, supersweet) Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love to walk around and look at all the poetry on the walls, but unfortunately, the itinerary's really tight. \nGARRETT Why are you talking like that? \nELIZABETH Just go sit down, sweetie. Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to his seat. Scott smiles at Elizabeth. \nSCOTT Wow, you are such a natural. \nELIZABETH When you love what you do, it comes easy. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nA splotchy-faced Amy trudges down the hallway. She passes Elizabeth's room, stops, walks back to the door and peers in. She looks down the hallway -- it's empty. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAmy rifles through Elizabeth's desk. She opens the top drawer. Just pens and paper. She tries the bottom drawer. Locked. Shishkebabs! \nINT. EMPTY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nAmy drags ELIZABETH'S DESK across the hallway into her room. It's a slow, difficult and loud process. \nINT.

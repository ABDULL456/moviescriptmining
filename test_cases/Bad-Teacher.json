{"train": "BAD TEACHER \nWritten by \nLee Eisenberg & Gene Stupnitsky \nJune 6, 2008 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY \nTo establish. A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads, \"GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!\" A JANITOR opens the glass and starts removing the letters. \nINT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY \nPOP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling. TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note: female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.) PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers. He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Well, it's been another great year here at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus' haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you. SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly enjoying the small compliment. \nSANDY I ain't afraid of no ghost. The other teachers laugh. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Or the wild success of... \nVOICE (O.C.) Wally, can I just say one quick thing? Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students and adults alike -- like students. \nAMY Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over. So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm? That's it. Back to you, Wally. A bunch of teacher roll their eyes. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Thanks, Amy, (then, back to his notes) . Or the wild success of the book drive for the women's prison sponsored by Ms. Savicki's class? A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) But now as the summer is upon us, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty. \n(BEAT) Elizabeth, can you come up here? ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) You've only been with us for one short year, but know that you'll always be a part of the JAMS family. Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile. The Teachers lightly applaud. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) And we got you a little something. Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and. pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37. \nELIZABETH Almost forty dollars. Thank you! \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Why don't you say a couple words? \nELIZABETH Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this type of thing so I'll make it quick. I know I've only been here a year, but there's so much I'm going to miss... \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nElizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing the few personal effects she has into a banker's box. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) My students, probably most of all.I'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher. Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last days of seventh grade. A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she signs it. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nElizabeth walks down the hall holding her box. SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her, running toward their summer vacation. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) And I wish that I had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding, I had my hands full. From the little I do know about you, I know that our students are in good hands. Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes. \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY \nThree middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a thicket on the outskirts of the school property. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) And I can't believe it's all over. This year flew by. And even though I'll never teach again professionally, I've realized that I don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example. Elizabeth comes up behind them. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of the burnouts hands her the joint. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops. \n(SWEET) Listen, Marky, you made a mistake. You're human. I'm human. And this time it was you. Maybe six months from now, you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but probably. Sheila SNEEZES again. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Shut the fuck up. (then, to Mark, sweet) And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us. \nMARK I'm not. And you know why? Because Sheila loves me -- and not just for my money. Sheila squeezes his shoulder. \nELIZABETH I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night. \nMARK What are you talking about?! Both your parents are CPAs. \nELIZABETH My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you. \nMARK It's over, Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married. (beat, sweet) Because I love you. \nMARK (rolls his eyes) I'm gonna need the ring back. She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows. \nELIZABETH You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together! \nMARK Elizabeth. The ring. \nELIZABETH (not turning around) I'm not even listening to you anymore. She starts to open the door. He closes it. The ring! \nELIZABETH Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease. Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS behind her. \nCHYRON: 3 MONTHS LATER \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY \nA red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license plate reads \"HERS.\" \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nElizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a person has never looked less happy to be anywhere. FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye. \nELIZABETH (under her breath) You've gotta be shitting me. \nTURN TO REVEAL \nAMY'S CLASSROOM The room has been decorated to within an inch of its life. Every surface is covered with posters like \"Noted African-Americans,\" or \"Hispanic American Hall of Fame,\" or \"Women Who Dared.\" A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been placed on each student's desk. Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying to hang a large \"INTEGRITY\" poster. She looks over, sees Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up. \nAMY Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe! \nELIZABETH Amy Squirrel. \nAMY I know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but I just want to say that I'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates. \nELIZABETH Okay. \nAMY And I know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and I just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at -- Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands. \nAMY (CONT'D) Where's your beautiful ring? \nELIZABETH My fiance and I broke it off. I found him in bed with someone else. Oh my gosh! \nELIZABETH It was another man. \nAMY \n(INCREDULOUS) Shut the front door! (motioning for a hug) Somebody needs a hug. \nELIZABETH Somebody doesn't. \nAMY Hm. Another time then. Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk. \nELIZABETH Yeah, I'm not going to that. \nLYNN But it's mandatory. \nELIZABETH (\"I'm so scared\") Ooohhh... \nLYNN Yeah, I probably won't go either. I don't know I might. I'll probably go, but just sit in the back. Maybe leave early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it by ear. Or just stay till the end. Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them. \nLYNN (CONT'D) This was fun. \nELIZABETH Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay. \nLYNN Sorry. \nELIZABETH It's okay. You can get me next time. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNot much character, not many furnishings. \nElizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US Weekly. She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit. The front door opens and her roommate, KIRK, early 30s, boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp, walks quickly past Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits? He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it. Go bigger. Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door. \nELIZABETH Cool, yeah. She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (under her breath) Fuck my ass. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nElizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off. She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nFirst day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before long, the hallway is empty. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING \nIn one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself modelling in a \"Western-Style\" clothing catalogue. GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt with block letters that read \"GYMNASTICS,\" stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away. \nCHASE The photographer was, like, sooo nice. He made me feel sooo comfortable. \n(THEN) I might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week. \nGARRETT \n(RIVETED) Oh my. Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as surprised as they are that he spoke. \nCHASE Stalk much? Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK JERSEY, turns to Garrett. \nTRISTAN \n(FAKE SNEEZING) Faggot. \nGARRETT \n(EARNEST) Bless you. \nTRISTAN What'd you say to me? Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat. The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large Tupperware tray. \nSASHA Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet you. (handing over tupperware) My mother baked these for you. \nELIZABETH (not looking up) Just leave them on the desk. Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there. After a moment, Elizabeth looks up. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) You need something? \n- Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class. \nEmpty. Elizabeth looks around and spots the \"INTEGRITY\" poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nElizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way. Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She turns on her heels. Fresh fish. \nELIZABETH \n(VERY FRIENDLY) Hi there. You look a little lost. \nSCOTT Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is? \nELIZABETH I'll do you one better. I'll take you there. \nSCOTT Oh, you don't have to do that. \nELIZABETH Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure. \nSCOTT Thanks! I feel like I've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes. \n(EXTENDS HAND) Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub. \nELIZABETH Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language Arts. Welcome, welcome. They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices Scott's VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre? \nSCOTT Good eye! \nELIZABETH Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby. \nSCOTT It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for .a year, but my grandfather designed it, so... \nELIZABETH Oh? Your grandfather designs watches? \nSCOTT The family business. My mom's maiden name is Jaeger. \nELIZABETH Shut up! \nSCOTT My parents had a minor meltdown when I decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher. But they've been cool about it. Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) Integrity. \nELIZABETH \nSCOTT (pointing to poster).. The poster. \"Integrity.\" What a great message for the kids. \nELIZABETH That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them. \nGARRETT Hey, Ms. Halsey! \nELIZABETH Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles. \nSCOTT Man, I can't wait for the day that I have my own classroom. \nELIZABETH Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town? \nSCOTT I'm not married. \nELIZABETH Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother. \nSCOTT That's horrible! \n(NOTICING) Ooh, 124! This is me. \nELIZABETH Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte. Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other. \nSCOTT \nPRINCIPAL:SNUR \n(TO HIMSELF) Amazing. \nAMY (O.S.) Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy Squirrel. He instinctively covers himself with the brochure. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Amy? What are you doing? Get out! \nINTERCUT WITH: Amy standing inside. She scrunches her nose at the smell. \nAMY This'll just take a sec. I thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR \n(THRU STALL) Can we talk about this later? \nAMY (quoting some adage) \"Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly.\" \nAnother TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success. And Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the kids had a great time. \nAMY I don't want to speak out of school, but I happened to be pedalling by and saw her get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And remember, we barely know anything about her. She was a real lone wolf last year. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash? \nAMY Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever she did worked. And next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing, you better be damn sure. We're done here. Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED. \nAMY Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super day, you two. Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION from the other stall, followed by a sigh. \nMALE TEACHER (O.S.) \n(IN STALL) Christ... I thought she was never going to leave. \nINT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY \nSandy, the math teacher with the ponytail, sits at the table grading papers. Another TEACHER dozes in the corner. \nELIZABETH (entering, very friendly) Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's? \nSandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. \"Is she talking to me?\" Guilty. \nELIZABETH How's Period 5? \nSANDY Great, thanks for asking. We got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig, which is nice because it's earned. It's time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out. \nELIZABETH Awesome! \n(THEN) Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge? Sure thing. Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug. \nSANDY (CONT'D) You should come to one of our shows. He hands her the yogurt. \nELIZABETH Oh, I can't. Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee. \nSANDY I didn't even tell you the dates. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nElizabeth's class is seated. They're staring at her, waiting for her to begin. \nCHASE Are we starting \"School Ties\" today? Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a \nNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. \nThe camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture of a topless AFRICAN TRIBESWOMAN with large breasts. After a beat, Elizabeth looks up. \nELIZABETH (news to her) Yeah, Silly, I meant after. \nSCOTT Cool! Let's get a group together. \nELIZABETH Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us. Scott looks around, then lowers his voice. \nSCOTT Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered. You're one of the nicest people I've met here. But... I'm actually seeing someone. \nELIZABETH Oh? \nSCOTT Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet. \nELIZABETH Because she's ugly? \nSCOTT No. She's beautiful. She's great. She really cares about the kids. It's just... when you're dating a co-worker... \nELIZABETH \n(REALIZING) Squirrel? Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott, signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse. She quietly seethes. \nSCOTT Anyways, thanks again for asking me out. I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck on that group date. See ya! Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a four cartons of milk. \nLYNN Here you go. I got you one of each. \nLynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them in the trash and storms off. \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nAt night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT \nElizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS. They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for a beat too long. \nELIZABETH Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points to her. \nSASHA'S MOTHER Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each other at the carwash. I'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies. What about the state test? Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- \"Don't Question My Authority.\" \nELIZABETH That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do. (as the parents take this in) And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say. \n(THEN) Help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back. Class dismissed. They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON \nA \"refreshments\" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER. Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by a sharply dressed PARENT. \nPARENT #1 Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. \n(EXTENDING HAND) I'm Chris' dad. From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who Chris is. \nELIZABETH Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. \nCHRIS' DAD Oh, what a relief. I just wish his grades would reflect it. \nELIZABETH If I know Chris, he'll get there. \nCHRIS' DAD Listen, I know you have a full plate, but if you could keep an eye on Chris, my wife and I would really appreciate it. Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand, sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks back up at Chris' dad. \nCHRIS' DAD (CONT'D) \n(WINKING) For supplies. Or whatever. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nElizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're eating Oreos and sipping water. \nELIZABETH You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. The parents beam. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe SONG continues as Elizabeth throws more money in her \"New Tits\" jar and enters a new amount into her notebook. The new balance: $1473. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \n\"Gangster's Paradise\" CONTINUES and we see that the class is now watching \"Dangerous Minds\" with Michelle Pfeiffer as a tough-as-nails teacher in an inner-city school. \nINT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - SAME \nThe SONG continues as Amy, in her empty classroom, stands against the adjoining wall, her ear pressed to it. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nThe SONG continues. The class is still watching \"Dangerous Minds.\" There's some NOISE in the hall. Elizabeth PAUSES the movie, STOPPING the song. She leans into the hall. \nELIZABETH Enough with the commotion! The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES the movie. The SONG comes back on. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nThe SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with friends. Elizabeth pushes through the center. \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY \nThe SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales. KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS. Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha, bundled in her winter coat, waving. \nELIZABETH (through the window) What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth doesn't. \nSASHA Is that marijuana? \nELIZABETH It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business. \nSASHA Oh, okay. Feel better. \n(THEN) My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here. Sasha pulls out a tupperware container. \nELIZABETH (peering through window) Are those oatmeal raisin? \nSASHA Sugar. Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie. \nELIZABETH You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress. \nSASHA I don't want to run for congress. I want to be president. \nELIZABETH See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it. \nSASHA If I think about it, will I get extra credit? \nELIZABETH (shakes her head) Hopeless. Watch your feet. \nElizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car. Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that reads, \"Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!\" \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY \nElizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets out of bed. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - DAY \nQUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce packets. She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once. Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck. She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove, and tries lighting it from there. No luck. \nELIZABETH Seriously? \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - AFTERNOON \nGARRETT This is called \"The Chase,\" by Garrett Tiara. \n(READING) XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/ Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great? / About her smile / That I would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending. Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps, then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off. \nELIZABETH She sits back down. \nGARRETT We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve... (really reaching for it) Ba-lance... Thank you. He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks to Elizabeth for a reaction. \nELIZABETH Junior likes to rhyme. \nMELODY Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a hand with dessert -- give them a chance to talk about the poem. The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH So your poem's about that girl? \nGARRETT Chase, yeah. You got the subtext. \nELIZABETH Can I give you some advice? \nGARRETT Please. \nELIZABETH Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions. \nGARRETT But I like Chase. \nELIZABETH Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful. \nGARRETT What do you know? You don't-even know our names. \nELIZABETH I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same \"Gymnastics\" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know. \nGARRETT \n(EMOTIONAL) This sweatshirt was my dad's. It's all he left when he left. \nELIZABETH Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it. \nGARRETT (quiet, steely) Fuck you. Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder. \nELIZABETH Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door. \nGARRETT Happy New Year. Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over? She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth. She looks haggard. She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup and takes a long swig. The kids look at each other, like \"what is she doing?\" Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough. \nELIZABETH Shut up. \nINT. WOMEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY \nElizabeth is-checking her makeup in the mirror. Lynn enters. Her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it. \nLYNN Hey, welcome back. \nELIZABETH What is that, vomit? Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain.. \nLYNN Yeah, and a little blood. The kids had too much sugar. \n(MORE) \nLYNN (CONT'D) Anyways, a bunch of us are going out tonight to see Period 5 play. Do you want to come? \nELIZABETH Ugh. No. Elizabeth heads out. Lynn, still blotting, follows her. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nElizabeth and Lynn bump into Scott. \nINT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN \nThe sun is breaking. \nINT. AMY'S CAR - SAME \nAmy listens to NPR as she pulls into the empty parking lot. Suddenly, she SLAMS on her brakes. ELIZABETH'S CAR is already there. Amy puts her car in park and gets out. She walks over to Elizabeth's car and feels the hood. \nAMY Cold. \nINT. J.A.M.S. - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe clicking of Amy's shoes ECHO through the empty hallway. She stops, takes off her shoes. She pitter-patters down the hall to Elizabeth's classroom and PEERS in. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - SAME \nElizabeth is at the chalkboard, intently writing questions. She senses something in her periphery and looks over at her window. Nothing. Elizabeth goes back to work. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER \nElizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his backpack into class. \nELIZABETH \n(TO GARRETT) Let's go, Sylvia Plath. Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe.. Elizabeth winces and glares at Garrett. The rest of the class enters, stops, noticing WORK PACKETS on each of their desks. \nCHASE \n(LOOKING AROUND) Where's the TV? \nELIZABETH \n(ALL BUSINESS) Everyone, take your seats. Shawn turns to Spencer. \nSHAWN What do you think's going on? Spencer shrugs. \nELIZABETH Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as they're opened for the first time. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (checking her notes) Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone? \nGARRETT Because she's a cry baby. The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett. \nELIZABETH \n(TO GARRETT) Get out. Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the door. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus. \nSASHA (raising hand and answering) You never assigned it to us. \nELIZABETH Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) On the first hundred pages. \nPANDEMONIUM. \nSASHA You can't do that! I have band and jazz band tonight! \nSHAWN We haven't had homework all year! \nELIZABETH Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator. \n(BEAT) Things are about to change. Recess is over. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT, dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy of \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" \nELIZABETH (V.0.) Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish me luck. \nEXT. SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER \nElizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees. \nFRAT GUY Hi there. \nELIZABETH Is Tucker here? \nFRAT GUY \n(DISAPPOINTED) Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's here. (then, back to Elizabeth) So you coming to our \"CEOs and Corporate Ho's\" party tonight? Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away. Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep. \nTUCKER \nINT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY \nTucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk, unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room. BOB MARLEY plays softly. \nTUCKER Do you ever talk to my brother? \nELIZABETH No. He dumped me, remember? \nTUCKER You and my brother always had the histrionics. \n(THEN) So, do you want to come to our party tonight? \"CEOs and Corporate Ho's?\" We're kinda light on Ho's. \nELIZABETH Like I told \"Frat Guy #1,\" I'm not interested. \nTUCKER Then what's up? \nELIZABETH I need some date rape drugs. \nTUCKER (hurt, defensive) Two things. Number one: who do you think I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah, I'm in an awesome frat, but that really hurts. And two: they're not \"date rape\" drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for weightlifting. It helps build mass, okay? Why do you even want it? \nELIZABETH \n(DEADPAN) For lifting. \n(THEN) I have money and I'm in a rush. She takes out a wad of cash. \nTUCKER That's all you needed to say. No need to get all histrionic on me. Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small bottle containing a clear liquid. \nTUCKER (CONT'D) One capful makes you feel really good. Two capfuls will knock her out for a couple hours. You don't want to take any more than two. Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and then gives her a big, warm hug. \nTUCKER (CONT'D) Listen, I know you and my brother aren't together anymore, but I still think of you as a sister, okay? \nELIZABETH Get your hand off my ass. \nTUCKER Sorry, didn't even know I put it down there. Good luck with your lifting. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY \nAs Elizabeth drives, we HEAR a phone RINGING. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) I.S.A.T. How can I direct your call? \nELIZABETH (O.S.) Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman and I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune. Who could I speak to regarding allegations of racial bias on your standardized tests? A beat. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Please hold. \nINT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - NIGHT \nELIZABETH Well, that makes two of us. Elizabeth gives Carl \"fuck me\" eyes. He nervously sips his drink. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) What turns you on, Carl? \nCARL Everything. \nELIZABETH You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERS) Sex in an office. Getting fucked really, really hard against a wooden desk. \nCARL \n(SWALLOWS) Mine's metal. \nELIZABETH Even better. \nINT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - NIGHT \nCarl flips on the fluorescent lights and they flicker on, like dominoes across the ceiling. They enter his office and Carl awkwardly leans against the metal desk. \nCARL (gesturing, as promised) So this is the desk. \nELIZABETH Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) White wine in the office. You're a bad boy. Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Do you have any music? \nCARL Um... I could put on some internet radio. Carl goes to fiddle with his computer. Elizabeth quickly reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of GHB. She pours a little into Carl's wine. And then a little bit more. As he turns around, she hands him the glass. \nELIZABETH A toast. To new friends. \nCARL To new lovers. CLINK. Carl downs his glass. \nCARL (CONT'D) \n(NERVOUS) I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay? \nELIZABETH Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room. \nCARL K, first door on your right. Don't be long. Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk. \nINT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nElizabeth waits in the bathroom. Yawns. Checks her watch. \nINT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - LATER \nShe walks back in. Carl looks woozy. The only thing keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing Elizabeth naked. \nCARL \n(SLURRING) I wanna fug ya agains dis desk. \nELIZABETH Easy, Cowboy. Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen. \nCARL Marblorie! \nELIZABETH (as to a child) Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out, STILL STANDING. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She pulls out a folder. \n2009 ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf. She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN: \"You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie.\" \nCUT TO: \nELIZABETH \n(TO HERSELF) You can bet on it. \nINT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY \nDanni, the receptionist, uncrumples a BALL OF CRUMPLED CASH and counts it. Elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently. \nDANNI Almost done. We don't normally deal with cash here. At the doctor's office. Elizabeth slides the bonus check across the desk. \nELIZABETH And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by. \nDANNI \n(TO ELIZABETH) And when would you like to come in? \nELIZABETH \n(TO DOCTOR) \nMIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR Hi. He goes into his office. Elizabeth turns back to Danni. \nDANNI And when would you like to come in? \nELIZABETH Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar. \nDANNI A week from tomorrow, then? \nELIZABETH Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature. \nDANNI We have a 48 hour cancellation policy. Anything after that, you'll be charged 50% the cost of the surgery -- unless there are extenuating circumstances. \nELIZABETH I wouldn't miss it for the world. Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks down at her breasts. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) So long, suckers. \nEXT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN \nThe lot is empty except for Elizabeth's car. \nINT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nElizabeth enters and pulls latex gloves from her bag. She snaps them on. She takes a seat at Amy's desk and pulls an apple from her bag. Then she pulls out POISON IVY. She rubs the apple with the poison ivy leaves and then carefully places it in the center of the desk. Elizabeth smiles. \nINT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER \nAmy's class is seated. Amy enters and heads for her desk. She notices the apple and smiles at her class, touched. Thank you. The class stares back at her blankly. \nAMY (CONT'D) Who did this? No response from the class. \nAMY (CONT'D) Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra sticker on their all-star board? Amy presses the apple to her ear. \nAMY (CONT'D) (muppet voice, to apple) Who brought you to me? Amy places the apple up to her ear. \nAMY (CONT'D) \n(MUPPET VOICE) What's that, Mr. Apple? You want me to take a bite? Alrighty-roo. Amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class. \nAMY (CONT'D) Enough horsin' around, let's get started. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY \nA LUXURY BUS idles curbside. Parents see off their kids. Scott and Elizabeth are checking kids in. Principal Snur walks up. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR All set? \nMAINTENANCE GUY What's wrong with your face? \nAMY What's wrong with your face?!?! \nMAINTENANCE GUY Just making conversation. He finds the right key and opens the desk. \nMAINTENANCE GUY (CONT'D) All set. \nAMY (buying it back) Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos! The Maintenance Man exits. Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it. She pulls out the \"Annie\" wig. \nAMY (CONT'D) Busted. She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out from the front page. Amy's eyes narrow. She runs to the floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the two, clocking the I.S.A.T. address. \nAMY (CONT'D) Looks like somebody's in big, big trouble. \nEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY \nTo establish. \nEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - SMITHSONIAN - DAY \nElizabeth and Scott stand with the kids in the lobby area. \nSCOTT Alright, guys, count-off. The students begin their count-off. \nSTUDENT #1 \nSASHA \nSTUDENT #3 \nTRISTAN \nHe bumps knuckles with his friend. \nGARRETT \nAs the students continue counting off, we \nCUT TO: D.C. Montage: --Elizabeth and Scott walk with the kids through ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY. Elizabeth snaps her gum. --Elizabeth, Scott and the kids follow a TOUR GUIDE through the WHITE HOUSE. Elizabeth takes the gum from her mouth and looks for a place to toss it. She doesn't see a trash can and quickly sticks it to the bottom of an antique table. --Chase has Elizabeth take a \"Charlie's Angels\" posed picture of her and her minions. Elizabeth takes the picture before they're fully posed and hands the camera back. \nEND MONTAGE. \nINT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - DAY \nAmy, her face still covered in the rash, sits across from Carl Halabi, the administrator that Elizabeth roofied. Carl is staring at a photo of Elizabeth. \nCARL She changed her hair. Is Marjorie in some kind of trouble? \nAMY I think you're the one that might be in some kind of trouble! Did you or did you not give her a copy of the state test? \nCARL What?! No! \n(THEN) All I did was give her a couple of quotes ,for her article and that's it. \nAMY What article? \nCARL For the Tribune. She's a reporter there. Right? Amy's eyes go wide. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nAmy's car ZOOMS past the camera. \nINT. AMY'S CAR - DAY \nAmy's drives, her hands at 10 and 2. CLOSE ON the speedometer as the needle hovers between 55 and 56 mph. \nSCOTT Oh my gosh, I'm dry-humping the shit out of you. \nELIZABETH Erg. Dry fuck the fuck out of me. \nSCOTT Oh my gosh, I'm so close... I'm... pfft. Ugh. Scott rolls off of Elizabeth and exhales deeply. There's a wet spot on his jeans. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) That was a mistake. \nELIZABETH That was fast. \nSCOTT I know, I'm sorry. But this isn't me. And I. know this isn't you. I'm in love with Amy. \nELIZABETH But we're so good together. We both hate slavery, we both love teaching. And call me crazy, but I always imagined us spending summers at your family's compound in Hyannisport. \nSCOTT I know. And you're awesome and you have a huge heart and I love your empathy. It's just, when I was dry-humping you, I couldn't stop thinking about dry-humping Any. \nELIZABETH It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well, I'm getting new ones in, like, two days. Don't make a decision until you see them. \nSCOTT Elizabeth, I think you're beautiful just the way you are, even with your flat chest. And I think Amy's beautiful. But I just have to do what's right. I made Amy a promise. \nScott holds up his hand, showing off a PROMISE RING. \nELIZABETH What're you -- 13? Elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks. \nSCOTT Wait, Elizabeth. Don't go. Spend the night here with me. You can sleep on the other bed. \nELIZABETH \n(FAKE EXCITEMENT) Ooh, like a slumber party? I'm leaving. And for the record, your band sucks, asstard. Elizabeth opens the room door and exits. She tries slamming the door, but it's on a spring so it closes very, very slowly. \nEXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY \nThe kids listen to a TOUR GUIDE on the steps of the memorial. Garrett sneaks furtive glances at Chase. Elizabeth stands away from the group, on her cell. \nELIZABETH \n(ON PHONE) Wally. Why would I cheat? If I'm guilty of anything, it's teaching too hard. Great... I've got nothing to hide. She ends the call. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Fuck! Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and all of the students look over at Elizabeth. \nELIZABETH.(CONT'D) What?! The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing. \nTOUR GUIDE And does anyone know what Abraham Lincoln's nickname was? Sasha's hand shoots up. \nSASHA Honest Abe. \nTOUR GUIDE \"Honest Abe\", that's right. Because Lincoln always said what was on his mind, even if that meant being unpopular. Abraham Lincoln always showed great courage. Garrett takes this in. He looks over at Chase and then, after a beat, raises his hand. \nTOUR GUIDE (CONT'D) Yes? \nGARRETT I love Chase Streeter-Rossi. All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified. \nTOUR GUIDE Okay then. Any other questions? \nGARRETT (presses, turns to Chase) I love you, Chase. I've always loved you. And even though you pretty much stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I don't care. I remember the Chase that wrote me a card when my dad was overweight and had to go to the hospital because of his heart -- \nSASHA That was from the whole class. \nGARRETT Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a different card. \n(CONTINUING) And then, a year later, when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer, you wrote me another card. What happened to us? Remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I never did and I never will. I know we're really young, but remember Romeo and Juliet were only 13. A lot of people don't know that. So there it is. My heart on a sleeve. (goes into rhyming verse) Don't let me leave / Always believe / A beat. Chase stares at Garrett. \nCHASE Gross. Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the class joins in. Garrett runs down the steps, away from everyone. \nSCOTT Alright, guys, let's settle down. The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain. \nTOUR GUIDE \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nAmy, the phone cradled to her ear, leans back on her couch. She's wearing splotches of calamine lotion over her rash and her hair is pulled back. A TURTLE plods across her kitchen table. \nAMY \n(WHEELS SPINNING) Oh my gosh. We just might have a Mary Kay Letourneau situation on our hands. Amy scratches the turtle's neck as it continues across the table. \nSCOTT I don't know. You think? \nAMY I know. The woman's a criminal mastermind. \nSCOTT This is such a mess. \nAMY What I need from you is to focus and get our kids home safe. I'll take care of everything here. \nSCOTT Thanks, Amy. You're a lifesaver. \nAMY It's what I do. Love you, Scooter. She hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto the table, accidentally knocking the turtle to the floor. \nAMY (CONT'D) Oh boy. \nEXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT \nWe're no longer in the tourist areas. A STRAY DOG walks down the middle of the street. SIRENS WAIL. PROSTITUTES hail Johns with catcalls. Elizabeth, still in her broken heels, walks down the gritty street. - \nELIZABETH \n(CALLING) Garrett! Garrett! Her phone RINGS. She checks the CALLER ID -- \"HOT SCOTT.\" \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) \n(ANSWERING PHONE) I'm looking for him! Stop fucking calling me! \nShe powers her phone off and continues down the street. She passes two PROSTITUTES. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of a cry baby. Have you seen him? \nPROSTITUTE #1 Fuck you. \nELIZABETH Fantastic. \nPROSTITUTE #2 You best step off, bitch, because this is my block. This here's Poetry's block. \nELIZABETH Poetry? \nPROSTITUTE #1 Cause that's how she fuck. \nPROSTITUTE #2 I fuck like that. Lyrical. Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles. \nELIZABETH Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend. Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming up by a trash can fire. \nHOMELESS MAN #1 Won't get a cab in this neighborhood. A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the passenger window and leans out. \nJOHN Hey, sweetheart. How much for a titty fuck? \nELIZABETH I need a ride. \nJOHN Oh yeah, I need a ride, too. Right through those titties. \nELIZABETH No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and me pointing mace at your face. I'll give you ten bucks. \nJOHN \n(A BEAT) This is weird. Twenty. Elizabeth hops in. \nPrincipal.Snur sits across from Garrett's mother, Melody, who is beside herself. She is wearing a beret. A DETECTIVE and Amy are standing behind the desk. Principal Snur passes her a dolphin-shaped tissue box. \nDETECTIVE What else can you tell us about Garrett and Ms. Halsey's relationship? \nMELODY It was strictly student/teacher. Garrett's a gifted poet and Ms. Halsey was trying to bring that out of him. Amy snorts. \nDETECTIVE Did they ever spend time outside of the classroom? \nMELODY Aside from Christmas at our house? Absolutely not. The Detective glances at the Principal, like \"Oh boy.\" \nAMY She used to give all the guys that look. That sex look. You know -- Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective. \nAMY (CONT'D) She's a monster. \nDETECTIVE Mrs. Tiara, I think we might need to consider the possibility that Elizabeth Halsey has abducted your son and that the two of them are involved in a sexual relationship. \nMELODY \n(INCONSOLABLE) Marbles doesn't even have armpit hair! \nDETECTIVE (quietly, to Principal Snur) We should send out an Amber Alert. We need to catch this Sicko. \nTV NEWS FOOTAGE A REPORTER talks to camera on the steps of J.A.M.S. Other NEWS CREWS are in the bg. \nREPORTER A school official close to the scandal confirms that in addition to her alleged sexual relationship with the unnamed seventh grader, Elizabeth Halsey has been investigated for possible drug use, standardized testing fraud, and the theft of an \"Annie\" wig from a school production. The TV Report flashes an unflattering photo of ELIZABETH with a BLURRED OUT GARRETT. In front of the school, the Reporter turns to Principal Snur. \nREPORTER (CONT'D) Can you comment on any of these allegations? \nPRINCIPAL SNUR The superintendent will speak to the press shortly, but for now, I'd just like to say that I hope Ms. Halsey does the right thing and brings back our student. \nINT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - TRAIN STATION - NIGHT \nElizabeth buys two tickets. Garrett hovers beside her. \nELIZABETH \n(TO GARRETT) You're paying me back for this. \nEXT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT \nElizabeth's ex-fiance, mark, stands with Sheila and talks to a REPORTER. \nMARK Am I shocked? Mark starts laughing. \nSHEILA She was always very cold to me. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nChase is crying as she speaks to a DIFFERENT REPORTER. \nCHASE (wiping away tears) Garrett sat diagonal from me in language arts. He was always so supportive of my modelling career. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nLynn stands with a DIFFERENT REPORTER. \nLYNN \n(TEARY) She's my best friend. She tells me everything. We have lunch together! \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT \nKIRK And she has touched the lives of those around her -- until last night. Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle. \nELIZABETH \n(WHISPERS) You kind of sound like a pro. \nKIRK \n(WHISPERS) Do you think they're going to find out that I didn't pass the bar? \nELIZABETH \n(WHISPERS) You're doing great. They break from their huddle. \nKIRK Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own. As Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district. \nSUPERINTENDENT How do we make this go away? \nKIRK Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible. Kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk. \nKIRK (CONT'D) This is a list of our demands. The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list. \nSUPERINTENDENT You're kidding me. \nELIZABETH Don't answer right now. Let it marinate. Oh, and I should mention that if this goes to trial, I can cry on cue. Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast. And as quickly she started, she stops. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be heading to fifth period. I hate to be tardy. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY \nElizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium, the faint sound of \"Tomorrow, Tomorrow\" from \"Annie\" can be heard. Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song. She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options. \nAMY Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave us quite a scare, you did. Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking toward Amy, only feet away now. \nAMY (CONT'D) (attempting some levity) Somebody's being a grumple-- BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood. \nAMY (CONT'D) Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Well, it's been another great year at \nJAMS... \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYM - DAY \nQUICK CUTS. The year is winding down. Instead of gym, kids are using the time to sign each other's yearbooks. Chase walks up to Garrett with her yearbook, asks him to sign it. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) Who can forget the exciting addition of a climbing wall to the small gym... \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY \nQUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS. And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.) .Or the student/teacher spelling bee. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY \nMuch like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s. Polite laughter. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) But seriously... With summer around the corner, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to one of our own. Elizabeth smiles. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) Amy Squirrel. Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a pursed smile. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D) After six short years of outstanding, tireless work here, Amy is transferring out of the district. \n(MORE) \n", "test1_input": "(LEANING IN) You know, there are less expensive options. Have you looked into South America? \nELIZABETH I'll be back. Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nElizabeth, her cell phone cradled to her ear, pulls a LEAN CUISINE out of a freezer STOCKED with them. \nELIZABETH \n(ON PHONE) Look, I just really need some money. It's, for a surgery I need. Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife and turns on the microwave. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) \n(ON PHONE) Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my breasts, dad. \n(BEAT) Sorry. Happy belated birthday. So, can you wire me some money or not? \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT \nElizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around. \nELIZABETH (on phone, whispering) So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy. She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the back tire of a late-model CAMRY. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (on phone, whispering) I'm dying and I need money for surgery. Really? Nothing? Don't you get social security or something? Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - LATER \nElizabeth is still on the phone. CLOSE ON her computer screen. Her checking account balance: $45.66. \nELIZABETH (into phone, losing patience) Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement. Do you know how embarrassing that was?! \n(BEAT) Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me. Lover? You there? Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Fucking Troll! Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom. \nKIRK Did you call my name? \nELIZABETH No. I said 'fucking troll.' \nKIRK Oh, I thought you said Kirk. He turns and heads back in to his room. \nELIZABETH Hey, you got ten grand? \nKIRK Nope. Kirk closes his door. After a beat, he opens it. \nKIRK (CONT'D) Also, I might be a little short on the rent this month. Like, a lot short. \nHe closes his door. The microwave BEEPS. Dinner's ready. \nINT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY \nElizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner by a vending machine. Amy grades papers on a ratty- looking couch. She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn. \nLYNN I don't know. That's a lot of money. \nELIZABETH I know. And I hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you. This has its desired effect on Lynn. \nLYNN Maybe I could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me? \nELIZABETH That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that. (then, catching herself) But it looks great on you. \nLYNN Thanks. What about Mark? \nELIZABETH What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick? \nELIZABETH I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over. \n", "test1_true": "AMY (CONT'D) Sooo... I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I just want to say, that you shouldn't change a thing. You should be happy with the way you are. That's true. \nELIZABETH Huh. Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are? Amy stammers. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Lynn, you teach them. What do you think? \nLYNN \n(CONSIDERING) I've never asked them. \nAMY I would never -- \nELIZABETH We don't all have your tits, Squirrel. So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation. \nAMY I guess that's what you get for trying to help... Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and takes back her change without getting a drink. Amy heads back to the couch. \nELIZABETH That's right. Walk away. (then, noticing)- There he is! Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up. There he is! \nAMY Well, look what the cat dragged in! \nSCOTT I wish it was under better circumstances. Stu Riley's car was vandalized last night. Right in his driveway. \nAMY Gang members, probably. \nSCOTT \n(QUIET RESIGNATION) The public school system failed them. Elizabeth and Amy nod vigorously. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nAn empty hallway. \nJOE CLARK (V.0.) So forget about the way it used to be. This is not a damn democracy! We are in a state of emergency and my word is law! There's only one boss around here, and that's me. The HNIC. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe class is watching \"Lean on Me,\" with Morgan Freeman as a tough-as-nails principal in an inner-city school. Amy's \"Integrity\" Poster now hangs above the TV. \nMR. O'MALLEY (ON TV) \nHNIC? \nMS. LEVIAS (ON TV) Head Nigger In Charge. The bell RINGS. \nELIZABETH We'll pick this up again tomorrow. The students shuffle out. Garrett hustles after Chase. \nGARRETT Quite a film, huh? Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends. Sasha lingers by Elizabeth's desk. \nELIZABETH (without looking up) What. \nSASHA I'm a student leader for the D.C. trip -- \nELIZABETH Shocker. \nSASHA And we're having our car wash this weekend. If you're around, maybe we could wash your car. \nELIZABETH I've got some Mexicans who already do it for nothing. \nSASHA It's for a good cause. This year, we're trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a Duck Tour! She hands Elizabeth a flyer. Elizabeth glances at it. \nSASHA (CONT'D) \n(SHRUGS) Last year's seventh grade raised $6000. \nELIZABETH \n(SUDDENLY INTERESTED) \n", "test1_id": 1011, "test2_input": "INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY \nElizabeth walks past the SCHOOL SECRETARY toward the Principal's office. \nSCHOOL SECRETARY You can't go in there. He's with a student. Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters. \nINT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe office is decorated with a DOLPHIN motif. Figurines, a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin. Dolphin calendars. This guy loves dolphins. Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you could try using deodorant, anti-. perspirant, maybe some cologne. I know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray. \nARKADY \n(BROKEN ENGLISH) Bodish spray. Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell. \nELIZABETH Blugh! Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his finger -- \"one minute.\" Elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR So why don't you think about that and I'll let your teachers know that you're working on it? Arkady nods and quickly exits. \nELIZABETH Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with anyone. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR We were just finishing up. Elizabeth, I actually meant to talk to you. Did I hear that you were showing movies all last week? \nELIZABETH Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot, of ways, movies are the new books. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Huh. Elizabeth tries a different tact. She picks up a dolphin- shaped clock from the desk. \nELIZABETH Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Me too! And if you like that, you'll love this. \nPrincipal Snur pulls out an \"Adopt-A-Dolphin\" certificate. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT`D) He lives in the Cayman Islands. \nELIZABETH What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from a kindred spirit. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR So what else is new? \nELIZABETH Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR What a nice surprise. \nELIZABETH Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Amy's been running it the last two years... \nELIZABETH She just does so much. It might be nice to give her a little rest. Especially that early on a Saturday. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR I'm so happy that you're dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the JAMS family. \nELIZABETH It just feels so good to help. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY \nAmy stands in the door where Elizabeth was just standing. Principal Snur is behind his desk. \nAMY Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade carwash? That's bonkers! \nAmy immediately regrets saying \"bonkers.\" \nAMY (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR I just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up. \n", "test2_true": "PRINCIPAL SNUR Amy, I see you taking on a.lot of responsibility, what with directing \"Annie\" and all your work with D.A.R.E. I'd just hate to see you get overwhelmed like you did in 2004. She stares at him -- clearly, this is a touchy subject. \nAMY Of course. Well, I should skedaddle. Looks like someone needs to plan a Saturday morning bike ride. She turns on her heels and walks out. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN \nElizabeth is asleep. Her ALARM goes off. It's 5:45 AM. She opens her eyes, sees the time, considers for a beat, then hits SNOOZE. She closes her eyes. - After a beat, the ALARM goes off again. She hits SNOOZE. Quick Cuts. Elizabeth hits the snooze button EVERY NINE MINUTES until 8:45. She stares at the clock. \nEXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - MORNING \nGarrett stands at the school entrance, holding a giant cardboard sign that reads \"CAR WASH\" as a few CARS pull in. Chase, and the other popular girls, are dressed in seventh-grade sexy -- they've tied off their shirts. The BOYS run around spraying each other, but mostly spraying Garrett. Garrett laughs, mistakenly thinking that he's part of the fun. \nGARRETT Oh, I'm gonna get you guys! A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters. Tristan, the bully, cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge at Garrett. \nTRISTAN \n(NOTICING SOMETHING) Whoa. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Tristan's gaze. ELIZABETH steps out of her car. She's wearing HIGH HEELS, DAISY DUKES and a BIKINI TOP. She looks both spectacular and ridiculous. A couple of PARENTS look over at Elizabeth, in shock. \nELIZABETH (calling to Parents) Sorry I'm late. \nMOTHER (to other PARENTS) I'm going to say something about her outfit. The MOTHERS vigorously nod in agreement. A DAD pipes in. \nDAD (staring hard at Elizabeth) Well, if it helps raise money... The other DADS vigorously nod in agreement. \nBEGIN CAR WASH MONTAGE: --Elizabeth holds the \"Carwash\" sign. A LINE of CARS forms. An OLDER MAN in an immaculately clean CADILLAC, rolls down his window and hands her money. --Elizabeth washes in SLO MO, shakes out her hair as she gets WET. The BOYS and their FATHERS stare at her. --The GIRLS try to mimic Elizabeth's seductive behavior. Their MOTHERS run over and pull them away. --The Older Man in the Cadillac comes back to have his car re-washed. \nEND MONTAGE \nEXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - LATER \nThe carwash is wrapping up. Elizabeth counts money at a makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal lockbox. She glances around and then shoves a large clump of cash into her DAISY DUKES. \nVOICE (O.S.) What are you doing? Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a TRUCK, clearly spying. \nELIZABETH Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy. \nSASHA Are you stealing our money? \nELIZABETH How dare you?! I'm here early on a Saturday for you guys. And for the record, nobody likes a tattle tale. \nSASHA I haven't tattled. Yet. \nELIZABETH Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and flunk your ass. How will that look on your resume? \nSASHA \n(TEARS UP) I didn't say I would say anything. \nELIZABETH Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta finish counting this money. Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) See you Monday! Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves back. \nANGLE ON ANY, across the street, watching through binoculars. She's straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a sheen of recently-applied suntan lotion. She takes a sip from her Camelbak, and pedals away. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a fish bowl with a crude sign that reads \"New Tits.\" Elizabeth drops in fistfuls of crumpled cash and then writes in a notebook: $1300. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nAmy walks down the hall. She sees Principal Snur slip into the bathroom. Amy walks up to the MEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM door and waits. The BELL RINGS. \nAMY Shishkebobs. She hesitates a beat and then enters. \nINT. J.A.M.S. - MEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY \nWally is in a stall reading a brochure for a DOLPHIN TOUR. \n", "test2_id": 1012, "test3_input": "(LOOKING DOWN) Oh shit. Hold on. Elizabeth turns away from them and starts rebuttoning. Sandy tries to sneak a peek. Scott shoots him a dirty look. Sandy gives an innocent shrug. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (grabs yogurt from fridge) I've just been such a mess the last few days. Working myself to the bone. \nAMY Yeah, it's been quite a change. \nSCOTT. Well, I think it's great. Some teachers just sail by, doing the bare minimum. It's good to know there are still some actual educators out there. Elizabeth smiles for Scott, like, \"You get me.\" \nELIZABETH Well, I should get going. Nice seeing all of you. Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth squeezes Scott's shoulder as she exits. Amy notices. \nSCOTT \n(RE ELIZABETH) What a good egg. \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER \nAmy and Sasha sit in the empty auditorium. Sasha is dressed as LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE, including the RED WIG.\" Student STAGEHANDS construct a set. \nAMY What else, Sasha? \nSASHA I don't know. I told you about the car wash money. \nAMY I can't prove that. What else? \nSASHA I think I've told you everything. \nAMY And no more movies in class? \nSASHA No, we're actually learning. Did you know that Animal Farm isn't even really about animals -- \nAMY \n(SNAPPING) Animal Farm?! That's not even on the syllabus! \n(MORE) \nAMY (CONT'D) (then, collecting herself) I know you're forgetting something. Do you want extra credit on your diorama or not? \nSASHA I want it! Let me think... Oh there was... never mind. \nAMY What? \nSASHA It was okay. It was medicinal. \nAMY Wait. Hold your horses. What was medicinal? \nSASHA Ms. Halsey was smoking in her car, but she told me her doctor prescribed it. \nAMY \n(TO HERSELF) Holy guacamole. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY \nSLO MO. Two scary-looking GERMAN SHEPHERDS, their teeth bared, pull two POLICE OFFICERS down the hall. \nPOLICE OFFICER #1 (to German Shepherd, coaxing) Come on, Axel, what do you smell, boy? The Police Officers continue the search. They lead the dogs up against lockers and knock on class doors. Amy and Principal Snur watch from the end of the hallway. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR \n(TO AMY) You better be right about this -- or I'm going to be getting a lot of panicked calls from parents. \nAMY Trust me, Wally. My kids in D.A.R.E. tell me everything and there are drugs in this school. And not just the students. Some of the female teachers. \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY \n", "test3_true": "TRISTAN (V.0.) Atticus Finch is a good lawer because he's a good person whose a layer. Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR -- \nELIZABETH (V.0.) Proofread. \nJUMP CUT TO: QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth grades another paper. She's growing more agitated and is now feverishly writing. \nELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Wrong!!! \nELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Is this English? \nELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D) Are you fucking kidding me? Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan runs to the door and peeks out. \nSPENCER Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool. \nELIZABETH Sit down. Elizabeth races to the window. \nELIZABETH'S POV The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (under her breath) Balls. She races back to her desk. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D Keep reading. Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk, obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS. Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her way through the second and then the third, the chewing becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder. Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by Principal Snur and Amy. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This will only take a second. Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes her mouth, breathes normally. \nELIZABETH Sorry. I had something caught in my throat. The German Shepherd continues barking. \nPOLICE OFFICER #1 What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy? The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth, almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett. \nGARRETT Ahhh!!! The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS. \nPOLICE OFFICER #1 (holding up Corn Chips) All clear. Dog must've responded to these. Happens. Elizabeth glares at Amy -- \"I know you were behind this.\" Amy glares back. Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head. \nAMY (grasping at straws, to Garrett) Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food is still contraband. That's detention, Buster. \nPRINCIPAL SNUR Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call off this witch-hunt. \nELIZABETH (pointedly to Amy) Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll excuse me, my class has a state test to prepare for. Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit. Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once, the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Whoa. \nCHASE Are you okay, Ms. Halsey? Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering. \nELIZABETH Class dismissed. \nSASHA But the bell didn't ring. \nELIZABETH Get out of my face. (then, to Garrett) And leave the corn chips. The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out. From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (to no one) But first, a nap. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT \nElizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt. A paper is stuck to her face. She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of things she's already corrected. There's FOUR. \nELIZABETH Balls! She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground. After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the, papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST MANUAL. And in the corner, an address: \n54 LAKEVIEW STREET Peoria Il, 61602 \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Huh. Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it. \nELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D) Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey... \nI/E.

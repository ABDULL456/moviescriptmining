WAYNE Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes. 
WURLITZER Don't call my men assholes. 
WAYNE I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here. 
Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up a light stand. 
WAYNE Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of these assholes. Now I want to create the illusion that this is just Mickey and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves. So make sure you don't film these assholes. I don't want to see 'em on film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five' slated our spot as human interest which means we'll go live at just after five-thirty. 
Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G. 
Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies. 
WURLITZER This asshole's tryin' to tell me what I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him! This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's dealin' with here, but we do. And if shit happens, he ain't gonna be responsible, we are. So keep your shotguns out, your fingers on the triggers, and be ready to fire at a moment's notice. 
BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a donut. He takes a big bite. 
ROGER Say something. 
MICKEY (mouthful of donut) What? 
ROGER Anything. 
Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem. 
MICKEY (talking in rhyme) I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore, As I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep! O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? 
Mickey bites into the donut. 
MICKEY (mouthful of donut) How was that? 
Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike. 
ROGER Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box. 
MICKEY There's a chocolate cream filled in there? 
ROGER Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special. 
MICKEY Tough titty, it's mine now. 
ROGER Look, I'll trade you. 
Wayne enters frame. 
WAYNE Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra. 
ROGER (to himself) Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer. 
Roger exits FRAME. 
Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey. 
WAYNE Sorry about that. 
MICKEY Don't worry about it. 
WAYNE We're about ready to go here. Are you ready? 
MICKEY Let's do it. 
Wayne smiles and exits FRAME. 
WAYNE (O.S.) Okay people! Let's start to settle down here.

ROGER (O.S.) Rockin'!

ALVY I think he has a little thing for Annie. 
ROB Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He goes with that girl over there. 
ALVY Where? 
Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a group of people close-by. 
ROB The one with the V.P.L. 
ALVY V.P.L.? 
ROB Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous. 
ALVY Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you? 
ROB There are no twos, Max. 
ALVY Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering. 
ROB M'hm. 
ALVY And ... uh- 
ROB (Interrupting) How do you like this couple, Max? 
A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking. 
ROB And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson. 
ALVY Yeah, intensive care ward. (Watching the woman in white) My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I think she's giving me the eye. 
As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward them. 
ROB If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole. 
ALVY I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi. 
GIRL IN WHITE You're Alvy Singer, right?  Didn't we meet at EST? 
ALVY (Reacting) EST?  No, no, I was never to est. 
GIRL IN WHITE Then how can you criticize it? 
ALVY Oh. 
ROB Oh, he-he didn't say anything. 
ALVY (Laughing) No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met? 
ROB (Shaking his head) Hi.  How do you do. 
GIRL IN WHITE Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned? 
ALVY Yeah, he's crazy. 
The girl in white laughs. 
ALVY (Looking at Rob and the girl) Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars. 
ROB Yeah.  Right. 
ALVY Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace. 
ROB We're gonna operate together. 
Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie standing by the buffet table. 
TONY We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album. 
ANNIE I don't know, this is strange to me, you know. 
TONY just ... that's all you need.  You can come and stay here. 
ANNIE Oh. 
TONY There's a whole wing in this house. 
ANNIE (Laughing) Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh. 
TONY You can have it to use.  Why-why are you smiling? 
ANNIE (Laughing) I don't know.  I don't know. 
She picks up an hors doeuvre.

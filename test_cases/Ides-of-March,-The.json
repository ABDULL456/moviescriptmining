IDA He's not going to Texas? \nSTEPHEN No need, we'll split Texas, it's a wash. IDA What if I said North Carolina? STEPHEN That's your guess? \nIDA He's going to North Carolina. \nSTEPHEN I will neither confirm nor deny that statement. \nIDA I knew it. Now tell me why. \nSTEPHEN That I cannot do.

IDA (CONT'D) You really buy into all this crap? All this take back the country nonsense? \nSTEPHEN Ida I'm not naive about this stuff. I've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty...I'm telling you this is the one. IDA You really have drunk the kool-aid. \nSTEPHEN I have drunk it it's delicious. I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win. \nIDA Or what? The world will fall apart? It won't matter...Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again. If your boy wins...You get a job in the white house...If he loses you're back at a consulting firm on K Street...That's it. You used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy.

IDA That's huge. \nPAUL It's more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates...they all travel with him. That puts us over the top.

BEN Okay so listen up...these are your new cell phones...Shelly has pre- programmed everyone's numbers in...thank you Shelly...no personal calls...if you lose them, Paul has authorized me to kill you. Ben walks into Stephen's office and hands him his new phone. \nBEN (CONT'D) New phones... STEPHEN I'll get it in a bit... \nAs Ben leaves, we see that Stephen is looking at early footage of Governor Morris. Another staffer and an editor are watching it with him. Outside the office we can see other staffers, through the glass partitions, running around in campaign mode. We see some of the footage. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGOV MORRIS (ON MONITOR) The economy...health care...I've got to believe we can do it. We have enemies...we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies, and see if there is something we can do about that besides using force. What we know from history is the answer to extremism is not extremism. Whoever is the next president, whoever steps up, has got a lot of work to do, but you have a little work to do yourself. Stephen hits pause. \nSTEPHEN Fucking kill me...where did we get this? \nEDITOR Before he announced at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania... \nSTEPHEN Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it - \nEDITOR It plays to his base, if- \nSTEPHEN Are you fucking stoned...this is the same...the exact same piece the Republicans are gonna run against him in the general...we don't need to brag about it...Hi I'm Neville Chamberlain and I want to be your commander in chief.

Also on Board are BEN and a SECRET SERVICE AGENT. Stephen is holding onto the armrests, white knuckling it, the Governor watches him. \nGOV. MORRIS You okay? \nSTEPHEN Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground. \nGOV. MORRIS I think the weather might determine that. If we get there. \nBoth men sit with their heads back on the headrests. STEPHEN We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing. GOV.

MORRIS Listen Stephen...you're not Paul. I pay him to use the word \"great\". I pay you to tell me the truth. \nSTEPHEN I think we're solid. GOV. MORRIS Okay Paul.

STEPHEN I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause. \nGOV. MORRIS You'll make a lousy consultant when you're out of this line of work. STEPHEN Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it. GOV. MORRIS So at best you've got eight years...then you'll end up with a nice little consultant firm on Farragut North...eating at the Palm...pulling in seven hundred and fifty grand a year...pimping out Senators to Saudi Princes.

KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - OHIO - LATER \nWe're in a large hall. GOVERNOR MORRIS is on stage, he stands in front of a huge American flag. Morris's wife CINDY is standing in the wings along with their seven year old daughter BETH. GOVERNOR MORRIS addresses the crowd. \nGOV. MORRIS Now, I've been married for eleven years, to the smartest person I know...and we have a normal marriage...which means when we disagree...she wins. What we don't ever disagree on is how we're going to leave this planet for our daughter. Are we gonna leave it better off, or worse? The richest people in this country don't pay their fare share. And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth. That scares everybody and they all run and they hide. For the record, my campaign is vehemently against the distribution of wealth to the richest Americans, by our government! And I will run on that! \nINT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nPAUL and STEPHEN are back stage behind the huge American flag. We can hear the Governor's speech in the B.G. STEPHEN I didn't think it was true. PAUL Whoa... \nSTEPHEN But I should have told you this yesterday...sorry... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nPAUL -Slow down. \nSTEPHEN I met with Tom Duffy yesterday. PAUL What? STEPHEN You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you... PAUL Stop Stop let me get this straight. You met with Tom Duffy? \nSTEPHEN Yes. \nPAUL What'd he want Stephen? STEPHEN -the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State. \nCUT TO: INT. KENT STATE UNIVERSITY - STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nGOV.

MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWe're tight on a TV. It's the taped broadcast of the previous town hall meeting. As the scene plays we pull back to see STEPHEN and MOLLY making love. We see pieces of body parts. Hands...a leg...hair being pulled...it's what we've grown used to seeing in a seventies love scene, all lit by the flickering of a television. The only score we hear is the sound of the TV. \nGOV. MORRIS See we're framing the argument based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice, you choose to be gay, not that you were born that way like being born black. Because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your DNA, then gay marriage is and can only be a civil rights issue. \nANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone. \nSTUDENT 2 Do you think candor is your appeal? Is that what you're running on as much as your platform...? \nGOV. MORRIS We'll see. It'll drive them to the polls one way or the other. \nSTUDENT 2 I just heard a lot of Christian Coalition cars start up. \nWe pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY. \nSTEPHEN on top not moving. He looks down to the area where an erection would normally be at this time...then he looks back to Molly. \nSTEPHEN It's not you. They laugh. CUT TO: \nINT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nStephen is lying in bed working on some papers. Molly is asleep next to him. Stephen's cell phone rings. STEPHEN Hello... \nAlmost at the same time we hear another man's voice on the phone. \nVOICE Molly? \nThey both stop. No one speaks. Stephen is about to speak again when the caller hangs up. Stephen looks at the phone...he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an identical phone. His phone. He's picked up Molly's phone by mistake. He looks at the name of the incoming call...there is none...he looks at the caller ID number...he looks at the clock...2:30 AM. \nSTEPHEN Your phone rang. MOLLY Really? \nSTEPHEN Who's calling at 2:30 in the morning? MOLLY I don't know? STEPHEN He asked for you by name. \nMOLLY You answered it? \nSTEPHEN I thought it was mine. Who was it? MOLLY I don't know... STEPHEN One of the other interns drunk dialing you? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMOLLY (KIDDING) Oh that never happens...let me see the number...

MOLLY Gimme my phone Stephen! \nSTEPHEN And I'm gonna tell him I'm coming over there with a shotgun... \nMOLLY (Getting more urgent) Don't do that Stephen... Hang up! \nStephen, listens to the outgoing message, while he looks at Molly...her eyes starting to well up. We hear the buzzing of the message through the phone. Then we see Stephens reaction as it begins to dawn on him who he's listening to. \nHe closes the phone without leaving a message. Beat.

STEPHEN There was a party with you...and Ben...and the Governor. \nMOLLY No he wasn't there. \nSTEPHEN Where was he? \nMOLLY I took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers... \nSTEPHEN After the party? MOLLY (Shaking her head yes) About midnight I guess...I stood in the doorway with him...we were talking...a long time...then he just reached behind me and closed the door. \nSTEPHEN Jesus fucking Christ...Were you drunk? MOLLY Not that drunk... STEPHEN How many times? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nMOLLY Just that once. \nSTEPHEN Does anybody know? Did anyone see you? \nMOLLY No. \nSTEPHEN How could you know? \nMOLLY I know! STEPHEN Then why is he calling you now? MOLLY I called him first. \nSTEPHEN Why? \nMOLLY Because I didn't know who to go to...and I needed nine hundred bucks...

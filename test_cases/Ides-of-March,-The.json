{"train": "THE IDES OF MARCH \nWritten by \nGeorge Clooney, Grant Heslov & Beau Willimon \nINT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY \nStephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight on him. The rest of the stage is dark. Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter of factly. STEPHEN I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution... A pause. Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops. \nWe hear the director speak over the loud speaker. \nDIRECTOR Hang on...let me open these up.... We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS ROUTINE. DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Okay... \nLights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage. Stephen continues. \nSTEPHEN I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in... \nThe lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He keeps going. STEPHEN (CONT'D) If I'm not religious enough for you, don't vote for me. To the Director. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) You got it? \nHis podium light comes back on. No answer from the Director, Stephen continues. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not... \nDIRECTOR Okay got it, thanks. \nSTEPHEN Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear. STAGE MANAGER You got it. \nSTEPHEN Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes. \nSTAGE MANAGER No I know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under... \nSTEPHEN Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours. \nWe see we're in an auditorium of a college. Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer. \nBEN I didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear... STEPHEN He doesn't but Pullman is 5'8\" he'll look like a hobbit behind that podium. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nThey walk off... \nCUT TO: \nSENATOR PULLMAN (READING) \"I have no idea what happens when we die, maybe nothing...maybe it was like before we were born.\" You did write this Governor... \nGOV. MORRIS Then let me try and clarify...I was raised Catholic, I am not a practicing Catholic...I have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President. I'll even vote for him. \nThe audience laughs. \nSENATOR PULLMAN Is that your idea of being specific? \nMOLLY passes out coffee. \nCUT TO: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS We're now live inside the debate. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGOV. MORRIS Let me be more specific. I am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, I'm not Jewish or Muslim...what I believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution. Meaning I will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. I believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. That's my religion. If you feel that I'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. If you feel I'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. Because I'm not going to change those to get elected. \nSENATOR PULLMAN I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible. \nGOV. MORRIS Is this a Democratic primary or a general election? \nPeople laugh. \nSENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR) Well Governor, whoever wins this contest will be running for President...and if you don't think that these questions won't be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land. I applaud your honesty Governor, I do...I'm simply pointing to what is obvious...we are running for President of the United States...not for student council president. \nINT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS PAUL ZARA - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage. STEPHEN sidles up next to him. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nIn the background we can see the candidates shaking hands. There is applause. \nPAUL is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between him and Governor Morris. \nArms crossed, they watch their man on stage. PAUL A double? \nSTEPHEN A double. PAUL Fucking national security. The GOVERNOR looks off stage to PAUL and STEPHEN for approval. \nPAUL (CONT'D) Outta the park. \nSTEPHEN Home run. We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate. TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy. He walks over to Stephen and Paul. \nDUFFY I'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before... \nPAUL Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before. \nDUFFY (TO STEPHEN) Must've been you that did the prep work. Paul's not that clever. \nPAUL You always had the brains Duffy, but me - I always had the balls. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nSTAFFER 1 We're still checking...it was a blog so who the fuck knows... \nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win. \nSTAFFER 1 Okay. STEPHEN We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting. \nEDITOR Got it. The Editor and staffer exit. \nStephen turns to his computer and types as Molly walks in and hands him some papers. \nMOLLY Ben wanted me to get you to sign off on this before the staff meeting. \nSTEPHEN Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this. MOLLY Anything interesting? \nSTEPHEN Just some white paper I gotta pass out tonight. \nMOLLY White paper? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nSTEPHEN Negative shit. Our oppo guys do research - we feed it to the press, hope they bite. MOLLY So like what sort of negative stuff? STEPHEN Read tomorrow's paper and you'll see. \nMOLLY Which paper? STEPHEN All of them. MOLLY So it's something big? \nSTEPHEN I wish it were something bigger actually. Just some transportation numbers. I'll have to spin this shit pretty heavy if we want it to stick. \nMOLLY Well that's what you're good at, right? \nSTEPHEN I guess. MOLLY (Holding up her phone) Did you get your phone? STEPHEN (Holds his up) Just now. \nMOLLY (MOCK SERIOUS) It's exciting isn't it? \nHe looks at her. STEPHEN You a Bearcat...? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nMOLLY A what? \nSTEPHEN A Cincinnati Bearcat? MOLLY Oh no...I'm not from here...I worked with you in Iowa actually. \nSTEPHEN Oh that's right...but you changed something. (Searching for a way out.) MOLLY My hair? STEPHEN You changed your hair. \nMOLLY (ENJOYING THIS) No.. \nSTEPHEN I must look like a total dumb ass right now. \nDUFFY You're working for the wrong man. \nSTEPHEN You're working for the wrong man. \nDUFFY Oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man. You've got something the other guys don't have. \nSTEPHEN Yeah? \nDUFFY Yeah, what is it exactly? Charm isn't the right word. It's more than that. You exude something. You draw people in. All the reporters love you. Even the ones that hate you love you. You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. And you make it look effortless. We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. But from the outside, you make it look easy. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: DUFFY (CONT'D) People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it. There's nothing more valuable in this business - the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love. You can guess what I'm gonna say next. STEPHEN No...I don't think I can. \nDUFFY I want you to work for us. STEPHEN You gotta be kidding me. DUFFY Not in the least. \nBeat. You are going to lose Ohio. \nSTEPHEN I am not. DUFFY You're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls...six percent of the Democrats polled. \nSTEPHEN Eight. DUFFY Six...but that doesn't matter...Independents and Republicans can vote for the Democratic candidate. STEPHEN You think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nDUFFY Fuck no they hate him...they think they can beat my guy...but they're worried about yours...so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz...Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a \"Get out the vote campaign\"...it's already started...every fucking conservative in Ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket...that's just one of the steps...Ohio is gone...the polls don't mean shit...tomorrow morning everyone will know...that's why I want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press... They look at each other. \nDUFFY (CONT'D) And by the way...we've got Thompson in the bag. \nSTEPHEN I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us. \nDUFFY We promised him Secretary of State, Ohio is over...it's been over for weeks...and with Thompson's delegates...I'm thinking down the road now...that's why I want you...I'll bring you in straight at the top. \nSTEPHEN I can't do it. DUFFY I'm not asking for an answer right this moment. \nSTEPHEN I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris! \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nDUFFY None of this is about the democratic process Steve, It's about getting your guy into office. Simple as that. STEPHEN This is the sort of shit the Republicans pull. \nDUFFY You're right, this is exactly what the Republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them. They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are. I've been in this business for twenty five years and I've seen way too many Democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants. \nSTEPHEN Paul's a friend. \nDUFFY Do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the President? Think about it...you have my number. Duffy gets up and leaves. \nCUT TO: EXT HEAD FIRST SPORTS BAR / PAUL'S RENTAL CAR / RESIDENTIAL STREET \nSTEPHEN walks to his car. He dials PAUL on his phone. Paul is in North Carolina driving. We intercut. \nCHARLIE ROSE and GOV. MORRIS mid-interview... \nGOV. MORRIS Is it a difficult decision? I would have to believe that it is... would I do it? No... but I can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body. \nCHARLIE ROSE So you would appoint a judge to... GOV. MORRIS ... I would consider it arrogant to judge someone until I've walked in their shoes. CHARLIE ROSE But you're against the death penalty? GOV. MORRIS Yes. Because of what it says about us as a society. \nCHARLIE ROSE Suppose Governor it was your wife... \nGOV. MORRIS And she was murdered, what would I do. CHARLIE ROSE It gets more complicated when it's personal. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGOV. MORRIS Sure...well if I could get to him I'd find a way to kill him. \nCHARLIE ROSE So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty. \nGOV. MORRIS No, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail. \nCHARLIE ROSE Then why not let society do that? GOV. MORRIS Because society has to be better than the individual. If I were to do that I would be wrong. \nCHARLIE ROSE And what about guns? \nGOV. MORRIS Isn't it time for a commercial. They laugh. \nCHARLIE ROSE This is public TV, we don't have commercials... \nGOV. MORRIS That's unfortunate. \n25 CUT TO: 25 INT. MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT \nWe're in Kentucky, just over the Ohio River from Cincinnati. This is where all the interns stay. \nIn the hotel bar, Stephen and Molly are sitting at a back table, they've both been drinking hard. STEPHEN Where'd you go after Iowa? MOLLY California for Super Tuesday. \nSTEPHEN I had to go to New York. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nMOLLY I know...you guys needed a lot more help over there. \nSTEPHEN Yeah. So why politics? \nMOLLY Because the pay is so good. \nSTEPHEN It just seems like an odd fit. \nMOLLY My dad is Jack Stearns. Beat. STEPHEN He's a good guy. \nINT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEPHENS'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING STEPHEN is on his cell phone, he paces back and forth in front of the TV - A news show in on. \nMOLLY is in bed - sheets pulled up around her, she's just waking up. \nCHRIS MATTHEWS (ON TV) In fairness, this has been tried before...Operation Chaos, as Rush Limbaugh called it, where Republicans voted for a Democrat they thought they could beat in the general election. We asked Senator Pullman's campaign manager if this sudden right wing support is welcome... \nCut to a pre-tape with DUFFY. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nDUFFY (O.S.) Is it decisive?...Of Course not...look, we believe that the polls are within the margin of error and that the Senator will win Ohio...with Ohio Democrats...I can't really see Republicans showing up to vote for our candidate...having said that, we'll take all the support we can get. \nSTEPHEN (On the phone) What time does Paul land?... Christ...who do we talk to about polling?...no...I just...I just need to get some internal polling on the fucking Independents and the right-wing nuts. \nMOLLY Do you want me to go? \nHe gestures for her to wait. \nSTEPHEN Listen, put me on the line with...what's the guy's name at the Wall Street Journal?... yeah... MOLLY You seem busy...I should go. \nHe whispers to her. STEPHEN Wait. \nBack to phone. STEPHEN (CONT'D) Right...Adler...get me on the line with him. \nMOLLY Steve? She starts to get dressed. STEPHEN Molly listen, just give me a second...I want to talk to you about something. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nMOLLY We can talk about it later if... \nStephen holds his finger up. STEPHEN (INTO PHONE) What? No nobody...just the cleaning lady...listen Ben...keep trying till you get him. We're gonna go with the position that we've always said, the race is closer than the polling...right...no don't...don't say that...just get him on the line and call me...I'll handle it...yup. He hangs up. STEPHEN (CONT'D) Sorry about that. \nMOLLY The cleaning lady. \nSTEPHEN What? MOLLY You called me the cleaning lady. STEPHEN You're not mad about that are you? \nMOLLY No why would I be mad? Beat. \nMOLLY looks at the TV. MOLLY (CONT'D) Look. \nSTEPHEN'S eyes go to the TV where CHRIS is still talking. \nCHRIS MATHEWS Earlier I spoke with Jack Stearns, head of the DNC, and he had this to say... \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nJACK STEARNS I know you're looking for a reaction, but listen we have two great candidates in a very tight race...and at the end of the day the voters will decide who best can represent this party in the fall. \nMOLLY No no not a clue. \nSTEPHEN You're very mature. \nMOLLY For a teenager. \nMolly kisses him and exits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

STEPHEN Yeah I'm on it...I gotta go. \nHe hangs up. \nINT. PRIVATE JET \nThe GOVERNOR and STEPHEN are flying through a bad storm, the plane is getting knocked all around. Also on Board are BEN and a SECRET SERVICE AGENT. Stephen is holding onto the armrests, white knuckling it, the Governor watches him. \nGOV. MORRIS You okay? \nSTEPHEN Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground. \nGOV. MORRIS I think the weather might determine that. If we get there. \nBoth men sit with their heads back on the headrests. STEPHEN We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing. GOV. MORRIS Is this your personal theory...cause I can shoot holes in it...Roberto Clemente...on a humanitarian flight. \nSTEPHEN Well there are exceptions to every rule... They smile. The Governor looks at Stephen. \nGOV. MORRIS So how we doin? \nSTEPHEN Fine now. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGOV. MORRIS No I mean...the campaign how we doin? \nSTEPHEN Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true. \nPAUL It doesn't fucking matter what you thought. It matters what you did. It matters what you didn't do. If all this shit is true I made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place. And I gave away our game plan. \nSTEPHEN Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point.

STUDENT 1 Gay marriage? \nINT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWe're tight on a TV. It's the taped broadcast of the previous town hall meeting. As the scene plays we pull back to see STEPHEN and MOLLY making love. We see pieces of body parts. Hands...a leg...hair being pulled...it's what we've grown used to seeing in a seventies love scene, all lit by the flickering of a television. The only score we hear is the sound of the TV. \nGOV. MORRIS See we're framing the argument based on the idea that homosexuality is a choice, you choose to be gay, not that you were born that way like being born black. Because if you start the discussion with the idea that gay is not a life choice but part of your DNA, then gay marriage is and can only be a civil rights issue. \nANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone. \nSTUDENT 2 Do you think candor is your appeal? Is that what you're running on as much as your platform...? \nGOV. MORRIS We'll see. It'll drive them to the polls one way or the other. \nSTUDENT 2 I just heard a lot of Christian Coalition cars start up. \nWe pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY. \nSTEPHEN on top not moving.

Stephen looks at the phone...he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an identical phone. His phone. He's picked up Molly's phone by mistake. He looks at the name of the incoming call...there is none...he looks at the caller ID number...he looks at the clock...2:30 AM. \nSTEPHEN Your phone rang. MOLLY Really? \nSTEPHEN Who's calling at 2:30 in the morning? MOLLY I don't know? STEPHEN He asked for you by name. \nMOLLY You answered it? \nSTEPHEN I thought it was mine. Who was it?

She reaches for the phone, but Steven keeps it away from her. \nSTEPHEN Hold on... \nMOLLY (Still waiting for it) Stephen... \nSTEPHEN I'm gonna call him back. \nSTEPHEN I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1.... IDA You're right -you've given me a lot. But let's get real here Steve. The only reason you ever treated me well was that I work for the Times. Not because I was your friend. You give me what I want, I write you better stories. Don't pretend it's any more than that. Why'd you meet with Duffy? STEPHEN Go fuck yourself. \nSTEPHEN starts walking away. IDA Okay, I'll make it easier on you. Forget Duffy. What happened at Paul and Thompson's meeting? STEPHEN (STOPPING) Will you keep your voice down. Do you have any idea what a story like this could do to me? \nIDA Of course I do. That's why I'm giving you a choice here. STEPHEN I could get fired. IDA So it's not a difficult choice, is it? I've got to file by three p.m. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) IDA (CONT'D) tomorrow. You've got till then to make up your mind. \nStephen is left standing there. CUT TO: \nEXT.

DUFFY is at a campaign event, he also talks on his cell. \nSTEPHEN You mother fucker. DUFFY Excuse me? STEPHEN You leaked it. \nDUFFY Leaked what? \nSTEPHEN Don't bullshit me Tom. \nDUFFY Bullshit you...I have no idea what you're talking about. \nSTEPHEN I just spoke with Ida Horowicz. DUFFY Yeah? \nSTEPHEN She's threatening to release the story. \nDUFFY What fucking story? \nSTEPHEN That we met! That I fuckin met with you! DUFFY How did she find out? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN Don't play dumb here Tom. \nDUFFY You think I leaked it to her? STEPHEN Who else? DUFFY I didn't leak it to her. \nSTEPHEN Well I know I didn't, so that leaves you. DUFFY What's she know? STEPHEN She knows whatever you told her. \nDUFFY I swear to Jesus I didn't leak it to her Steve. I don't want this story out any more than you do. STEPHEN Well too late. DUFFY What did she tell you? \nSTEPHEN She knows where we met, she knows when we met... she knows you had buffalo fucking wings. \nDUFFY She has a source?

MOLLY I could go to North Carolina and work on the campaign... STEPHEN Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play. Make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go. He exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STEPHEN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nSTEPHEN sits at the desk in front of his laptop. BEN sits on the floor surrounded by papers and a laptop. As BEN is talking Stephen is staring blankly at the screen. \nBEN Listen to this. I got the placement in the Times...this is a match up of hope versus fear. Nine times out of ten the fear candidate tends to be the most experienced...but in our presidential races the least experienced candidate almost always wins. JFK versus Nixon...Carter versus Ford...Bush versus Gore...I like our chances with the new kid on the block, end quote. Thomas Fucking Duffy...he's gotta be having a stroke right now. \nSTEPHEN'S phone buzzes, he picks it up and reads the text.

There is a TV on the wall, the news plays. \nDEBBIE DIXON Yes Mike, Senator Franklin Thompson of North Carolina arrived at the Lunken airfield today igniting rumors of a deal in the works. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: DEBBIE DIXON (CONT'D) The NY times is reporting that Senator Thompson will pledge his three hundred and fifty-six delegates to Senator Pullman. CUT TO: \nEXT. CLINIC STREET - NIGHT STEPHEN drives by the clinic, he slows to see if Molly is still there. The clinic is closed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT MOLLY gets out of a cab and walks into the hotel. Under this we hear: \nBEN Hey, where were you today? \nMOLLY I'm not feeling great Ben... INT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT \nWe're in front of MOLLY'S door as the scene continues. BEN You picked a hell of day to call in sick...Jesus...fucking wild day... \nMOLLY Why? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) STEPHEN (CONT'D) I can lay out his whole strategy for you. \nDUFFY I already know his strategy. Paul gave it all to Thompson. \nSTEPHEN What if I had something else? \nDUFFY You'd do that to Morris? To Paul? \nSTEPHEN Yeah. DUFFY Revenge makes people unpredictable Steve. I can't have someone who's unpredictable. Who's unstable. \nSTEPHEN (CALMLY) I'm not unstable. \nDUFFY If it had been a clean break -if you'd left Morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing. That we could control. But the way it'd look now -Paul fires you and then you come work for us. Looks like we're picking up the scraps. Puts Morris in the drivers seat. I can't have that. We see a shot close on STEPHEN'S clinched fist holding the yellow copies from Molly's clinic visit down by his side. We pan up to his face. STEPHEN What if I had something big? \nDUFFY Like what? STEPHEN Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down. DUFFY What is it? \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) \nSTEPHEN (Shaking his head) Give me the job. \nDUFFY It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Go take a nice long vacation. \nBeat. \nDUFFY (CONT'D) You're a smart guy Steve. Everything I said yesterday is true. But maybe politics isn't for you. STEPHEN Politics is my life. DUFFY Do yourself a favor. Get out now while you still can. Go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in Costa Rica - anything. Do what will make you happy. You stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical. \nSTEPHEN Like you? \nDUFFY Yeah. Just like me. STEPHEN You knew I was gonna tell Paul. \nDUFFY I didn't know. I thought you might, but I didn't know. \nSTEPHEN You knew if I told him he'd fire me. DUFFY Thing you gotta know about Paul- he's big on loyalty. STEPHEN Yeah I got a nice speech on that. You were never gonna hire me. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) \nDUFFY Put yourself in my shoes Steve. Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. What do you try to do? You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. This was a win-win situation for me. You work for us -great. Paul doesn't have you. Then again, if Paul fires you and I don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you. Either way I win. The moment I got you to sit down in that chair, I knew I'd won. \nSTEPHEN This is my life you're talking about. \nDUFFY It's not easy for me to do this sort of thing Steve. Don't think I take any pleasure in it. I'm sorry for you. I really am. Take care of yourself. \nCUT TO: 64 \nSTEPHEN pulls into the parking lot. \nINT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT STEPHEN climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his former co-workers. He gets to the fifth floor and walks down the hall towards Molly's room. As he turns the corner he sees a maid's cart in front of her room. The door is halfway open. \nThe GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN and the other staffers, sit in front of a monitor watching a news piece. We now cut to CNN footage in front of a hospital as we hear the report continue. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nJOHN KING (V.O.) The coroner has stated, that based on the evidence found by the police in the hotel room, that this was an accidental overdose, a lethal cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs. The Cincinnati police chief, Darryl Mathews, has called for a full investigation pending a toxicology report which could take up to two weeks. Just a terrible terrible situation for the former Senator, now DNC Chairman, Jack Stearns and his family. Off the Governor's face we: \nCUT TO: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - KENTUCKY - DAY \nSTEPHEN and SENATOR THOMPSON are seated on a bench. \nSENATOR THOMPSON I want on the ticket...you need me on the ticket...and you need my delegates...you could use em before Tuesday. Make a fine story on the Sunday morning news cycle...so I expect to hear from you by noon tomorrow...or I endorse Pullman and take my cabinet seat. \nThey look at each other. SENATOR THOMPSON (CONT'D) Anything else you want to talk about? \nCUT TO: INT. PRESS ROOM - CINCINNATI - NEXT MORNING \nWe're at a press conference - The GOVERNOR, PAUL, BEN, and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone. The Governor is making a statement GOV. MORRIS The entire staff is in a state of shock. We have sent our condolences to Jack and JoAnna Stearns and their whole family... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... All we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. Ida? \nIDA Is suicide ruled out? \nGOV. MORRIS We have no reason to believe... \nHe looks to Paul. GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) I don't think we have any of that information yet. Obviously there will be a full investigation. Just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family. \nREPORTER 5 Did you know her well Governor? \nGOV. MORRIS Not well. But I did know her, and what I saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. It's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to Jack. REPORTER 6 How long has she interned with you Governor? The Governor looks back at Paul. Paul steps up to the mic. \nPAUL She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check. IDA Will you continue with your schedule today? You're set to tour Proctor & Gamble this afternoon. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) \nPAUL We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart. \nAs these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. It reads \"Molly.\" He looks up. Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen. \nSTEPHEN holds a cell phone to his ear. They stare at each other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops vibrating. \nStephen turns and leaves. CUT TO: \nEXT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - THAT NIGHT STEPHEN approaches the restaurant - the lights are off. He peers through a window - we hear the door unlock. One of the Governor's SECRET SERVICE MEN opens the door. He motions Stephen in. INT. RESTAURANT - CINCINNATI - CONTINUOUS \nStephen follows the secret service guy through the dark restaurant - they pass several other secret service guys sitting in booths. They cross towards the back to the kitchen door - STEPHEN enters. \nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nGOV. MORRIS No. You were already fired, you were out. What were you doing in her room? \nSTEPHEN I was fixing a situation...I got a call, someone from the hotel thought I could help and called me. GOV. MORRIS You were off the campaign, but you thought it was important to come back and fix things? It was your voice on the phone the other night. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) GOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) You were fucking her. What did you do Stephen? \nSTEPHEN I loaned her some money and gave her a ride. \nGOV. MORRIS I bet you did. \nPause. \nAND THEN: \nGOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) There's no note. \nSTEPHEN Okay, there's no note. \nGOV. MORRIS Show it to me. \nSTEPHEN You think I brought it here? That's how people get hurt. GOV. MORRIS Okay let's play this out. You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal...and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison. You were fucking her and she told you about her situation. There are no records or conversations between us. And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence. So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine. Your word. A fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor...There's no note. \nSTEPHEN It's your call Governor. As the Governor weighs his options we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARBER SHOP - EARLY MORNING \nPAUL is sitting in a barber shop getting his hair cut... the BARBER cuts... Paul sits there. The TV is on... a sports show... no one talks. We watch Paul's face as the barber clips the back of his head. \nCUT TO: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BARBER SHOP \nPAUL walks out, starts down the street. As he passes the first corner, he sees the Governor's SUV and the Secret Service SUV both parked on the side of the road. Paul looks at the SUV... then walks up to the window. The window rolls down and the GOVERNOR leans his head out. \nGOV. MORRIS Paul you got a minute? \nWe stay outside the car for along time. We hear CHRIS MATHEWS under this shot. We see Paul get out of the SUV and the two SUVs drive off, leaving him standing there. \nEXT. NICER HOTEL - CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY - ESTABLISHING INT. NICER HOTEL ROOM- CINCINNATI - NEXT DAY \nSTEPHEN'S in a different hotel now. The TV is on. \nCHRIS MATHEWS How much could a big shake up days before the Ohio primary hurt a campaign. I asked Paul Zara how his firing could actually help the candidate. \nWe See STEPHEN, shaving in the bathroom mirror, as he listens to the TV. \nPAUL The Governor and I both felt, that in light of some of these changing numbers, it was best to put a new face on the campaign...Stephen is very talented...very smart... CUT TO: \nThompson turns and shakes the hand of Governor Morris. Morris steps up to the microphone. CUT TO: EXT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - CINCINNATI \nUnder the following we hear the Governor's speech. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nWe see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc. \nAt a catering truck we see a pair of hands grab some coffee and cookies. This is another young intern, JILL. We follow her across the street and into a door. \nINT. XAVIER HALLWAYS & RECEPTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS JILL comes through the door. \nWe follow her through the hallways crowded with television cables and technicians. She makes her way in to a large reception room, where Stephen is watching Governor Morris give his speech. She hands him a coffee. We cut between The Governor and Stephen watching from the back. GOV. MORRIS Thank you Senator Thompson! Well the polls aren't quite closed, but I want to congratulate Senator Pullman...And his Republican constituents on their win here in Ohio. The room explodes in laughter and applause. \nGOV. MORRIS (CONT'D) Senator Thompson I am honored to stand here today with you. I am humbled by your kind words, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of Saudi Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! We are not a nation used to coming in second or third... \nCheers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. XAVIER UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY & STAGING ROOM \nWhile the Governor's speech continues we stay close on Stephen as he walks through the crowd. We follow him into Governor Morris's staging area. Four monitors on a table show different network feeds. We watch Stephen roll down his sleeves and button his shirt. He ties his tie and puts his jacket on. From the monitors we hear reporters etc. \nWe push in on one of the monitors where DUFFY is being interviewed. As we push in we see STEPHEN cross out of the room. BEN is watching, he looks back and smiles at STEPHEN. DUFFY No it's not decisive, we still have several contests and those states are going to want to have their say. It does look like we'll win Ohio... \nRACHEL MADDOW But you must concede that these three hundred and fifty-six delegates put the pledged delegates out of reach. And with word today that the super delegates are breaking three to one for Morris. DUFFY We still have a lot of contests Rachel, Ohio is- \nRACHEL MADDOW Well then do you have the funds? As we read it- \nDUFFY (SMILING) Of course we have the funds.

I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win. \nIDA Or what? The world will fall apart? It won't matter...Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again.

IDA That's huge. \nPAUL It's more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates...they all travel with him. That puts us over the top.

We see some of the footage. \n(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: \nGOV MORRIS (ON MONITOR) The economy...health care...I've got to believe we can do it. We have enemies...we have to understand why our enemies are our enemies, and see if there is something we can do about that besides using force. What we know from history is the answer to extremism is not extremism. Whoever is the next president, whoever steps up, has got a lot of work to do, but you have a little work to do yourself. Stephen hits pause. \nSTEPHEN Fucking kill me...where did we get this? \nEDITOR Before he announced at a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania... \nSTEPHEN Thank God it wasn't overseas.

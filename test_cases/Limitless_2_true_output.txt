Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment. 
GENNADY Oh, I think guarantee. 
But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him. 
EDDIE (V.0.) Self-pity and MDT were not compatible. One has to go on... 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CLOSE ON - A SMALL ENVELOPE 
being put into Gennady's hand. A wider shot reveals Eddie, watching Gennady with contempt as he grabs a fistful of nuts off a bar table as he goes. Pig. 
EDDIE (V.0.) ...Patch up what's left... 
INT. CARL VAN LOON'S OFFICE - DAY 
VAN LOON I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie. 
EDDIE I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me-- 
Van Loon looks at Eddie penetratingly. 
VAN LOON I didn't know who or what I was talking to. 
EDDIE A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium. 
VAN LOON Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level. 
EDDIE I sent over my revised projections-- 
VAN LOON I didn't ask for your projections. 
EDDIE I know, but I think if you look at THEM- 
VAN LOON I already have. 
A long beat as the two men size each other up. Van Loon looks away, but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth. 
VAN LOON (CONT'D) As a matter of fact, there were firings over your projections. 
EDDIE I'm sorry. 
VAN LOON ...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Eddie stays cool. He's in. 
INT. VAN LOON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
EDDIE (V.0.) Two months after I started MDT, I was helping broker the most important merger in corporate history. 
Eddie sits with Van Loon, Pierce, and several POWERFUL LOOKING MEN, conferring. They look at an elaborate chart/graph that Eddie is sketching... even Pierce, his detractor, looks impressed. 
INT. W HOTEL - NIGHT 
Eddie is eating a luxurious room service dinner, going through files and projections. 
EDDIE (V.O.) I found that if I maintained an even dose... remembered to eat... drank no alcohol... the blackouts didn't recur. 
Eddie shakes one MDT pill into his hand, downs it. 
INT. LAYFAYETTE DAY TRADING - DAY 
Eddie is back on the trading floor, a crowd around him. 
EDDIE (V.0.) I was quickly back up to speed... 
INT. A MADISON AVENUE TAILOR'S SHOP - DAY 
Eddie is being fitted for new suits. 
EDDIE Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment? 
TAILOR Certainly, sir. How large? 
EDDIE Quite large. 
The Tailor nods, makes a note. He's certainly not going to ask any questions. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) I would never again stash my MDT, not in an apartment, not in Fort Knox. 
INT. A WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY 
Eddie, buzzing with charismatic authority, speaks to TWO BEEFY MEN, who are professional muscle. (Note: one has very elaborate tattoos on his fingers.) 
EDDIE I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper.

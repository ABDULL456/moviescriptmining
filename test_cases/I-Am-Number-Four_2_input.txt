INT. SUV - DAY 
John climbs in. 
HENRI Wasn't that your friend from the other night? 
JOHN Her name's Sarah. 
(ANNOYED) I didn't ask for a ride home. 
HENRI Principal called. Said there was an incident. 
John stares out the window, guilty. 
JOHN A guy was messing with me. I took care of it. Problem solved. 
HENRI You're stronger and faster because of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores. 
JOHN It was no big deal. Don't blow it out of proportion. 
HENRI You can't risk everything over wounded pride. 
JOHN I wasn't looking for a fight. It just happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it. ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house. John's gut churns as he stares at the image. 
HENRI Article says it was arson. 
JOHN We were clean. There's no way the Mogs can track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off. 
HENRI They can track us anywhere. I think it's time you saw what you're really up against. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
Sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty tools. Henri and John stand in the middle of the space. 
THE BOX 
is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and holds it over the crystals. 
ONE RISES. It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE FRAME and transporting him into 
A VISCERAL MEMORY. 
EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT 
EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke. The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather. Young John glances up and sees 
AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES. 
GRANDFATHER (in Loric with subtitles) Keep moving. 
EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT 
It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John and his grandfather race up the steps. 
INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT 
A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore, towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight. 
FOOTSTEPS ECHO! Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and straight into the path of 
TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS. The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn, they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat by a crystal-handled dagger. 
MAGENTA LIGHT

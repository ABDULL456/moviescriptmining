As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. 
The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers. 
EXT. TANK - DAY 
INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank. 
INDY Dad? 
HENRY You call this archaeology? 
INDY Get out of there, Dad! 
INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm. 
BRODY How does one get off this thing? 
As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down. 
INT. TANK - DAY 
Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor. 
EXT. TANK- DAY 
HENRY (to INDY) Where's Marcus?! 
Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. 
INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside. 
As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle. 
INDY Dad! 
HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip. 
INDY Hang on, Dad! 
SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY. 
SALLAH Father of Indygive me your hand! 
VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, INDY refuses to let go of the whip. 
INDY Sallah! Get Dadl 
SALLAH reaches out to HENRY. 
SALLAH Give me your hand! 
SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. 
INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head. 
INDY 
looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge. 
VOGEL 
He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs! 
LONG SHOT 
The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM. 
EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY 
HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank. 
HENRY Junior?! 
We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING. 
SALLAH Indy?! 
HENRY Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough. 
And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. 
Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. 
HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him. 
HENRY I thought I'd lost you, boy. 
After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back. 
INDY I thought you had too, sir. 
BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation. 
HENRY Wellwell done! Come on! 
HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge.

LISA That's perfectly clear. 
CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA: 
JOE Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to breathe on me?" 
CUT TO: 
THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th St. Deli, with a package (EXT./DAY) ... 
TITLE: "Two weeks later." 
CUT TO: 
JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN saunters by (INT./DAY) ... 
A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE: 
Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose. 
JOE (under his breath) Shit... 
Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him. 
JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS: 
Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes something. Sneezes. 
A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew. 
LIBRARIAN This is the supplement. You're right, there is a section on... (lowers her voice) ... HIV related discrimination. 
ANDREW Thank you. 
Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains. 
LIBRARIAN We have a private research room available. 
ANDREW I'm fine, thanks. 
Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching. 
LIBRARIAN Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room? 
ANDREW (pleasantly) No. But would it make you more comfortable? 
LIBRARIAN Whatever, sir. 
The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating she's done all she can do. 
As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks up his books and moves away. 
Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, who concentrates on his work. 
Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew. 
JOE Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'? 
ANDREW Fine. 
Andrew goes back to his work. 
JOE Who'd you get? 
ANDREW What? 
JOE Find a lawyer? 
ANDREW I'm a lawyer. How's your baby? 
JOE Huh? Oh. Great. She's great. 
ANDREW What's her name? 
JOE Rayisha. 
ANDREW Rayisha. Very nice. 
Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away. 
Joe comes back. 
JOE How did they find out? 
ANDREW (a second, then:) One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead. 
Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she hears the word "lesion." 
JOE Uh huh... 
Andrew concentrates on his work once more.

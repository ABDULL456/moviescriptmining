Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails him. 
Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window. 
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then... 
Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM 
INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down. 
The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the side.  The men look at each other, sneer. 
Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload. 
Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet. 
EXLEY I'm thinking we might walk away from this. 
At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground. 
The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest. 
Bud falls hard. 
Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen moment. 
DUDLEY I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. 
EXLEY Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland. 
DUDLEY Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history. 
EXLEY Why? 
DUDLEY A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. 
EXLEY And now you'll provide them. 
DUDLEY Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. 
Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear DISTANT POLICE SIRENS. 
DUDLEY This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over... 
Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket. 
DUDLEY Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective. 
It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses... 
Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE. 
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The two of them are bleached white by headlights. 
Dudley raises his badge over his head. 
DUDLEY We're policemen! (winks) Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives. 
Exley steps ahead to block his way. 
EXLEY No. 
DUDLEY Why not, lad?  Absolute justice? 
EXLEY Something like that. 
DUDLEY Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis? 
Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles. 
DUDLEY Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? 
Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward the gathering policemen. 
DUDLEY Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll -- 
The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his head.

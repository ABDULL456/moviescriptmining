Joyce swallows the pill. Harvey sits down next to her. 
HARVEY Yeah? You had a nice time? 
JOYCE Don't make people repeat themselves. It's annoying. 
HARVEY Oh, sorry. 
They're inches away from each other. 
JOYCE C'mere... 
She pulls him close. Harvey plants a kiss on her. 
They slowly separate. Joyce's eyes are closed. She likes him. He kisses her again. They start making out, moaning a bit. 
But before it gets heavy -- 
JOYCE Harvey? 
HARVEY Yeah? 
Joyce opens her eyes. She looks uneasy. 
JOYCE Which door's the bathroom? 
INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - 1980'S - DAY 
Harvey stands by the bathroom door, despondent. From inside we hear the sounds of moaning and flushing. 
HARVEY Hey, Joyce! What's wrong? What is it?

INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - DAY 
FLUSH! Joyce is doubled over on the toilet. She's looking green. 
JOYCE Ugh! I don't know. I think that yuppie food did me in.

OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
HARVEY I feel terrible. Lemme at least do something for you.

INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on. She picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room. 
Then she looks at the can and realizes it's WD-40. 
HARVEY Can I make ya something? How about some chamomile tea? 
Joyce puts the can down. 
JOYCE Chamomile tea? What the hell's a guy like you doing with that? I thought you drink soda pop for breakfast. 
HARVEY (O.S.) I dunno. I noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talkin' on the phone. So I stocked up on herbal teas for your visit. 
Joyce turns her head to the door. She's truly surprised by what Harvey's just said. And very moved. She smiles to herself.

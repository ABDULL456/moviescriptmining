DAVID I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself. 
WATTS All's well, I think. 
DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway. 
DAVID I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research. 
Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in. 
WATTS You studied our work for two and a half years. 
DAVID It's quite a data set. 
HOLLOWAY So you've seen everything. Well. What do you think? 
DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room. 
DAVID Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your "Engineers." 
BREAK ROOM 
A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians: 
ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache. 
MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist. 
They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate intelligence and competence. These are pros. 
DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them. 
HOLLOWAY Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms. Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts. 
Watts and the technicians exchange greetings. 
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D) About the materials I gave you. Some of the technical aspects... 
CHANCE We'll handle our end of the job. 
RAVEL If there is a job. 
Holloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly: 
CHANCE We only have a job if you find something. 
CORRIDOR 
Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door. 
VICKERS'S SUITE 
An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them. 
The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany desk, a dining table. 
Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod. 
WATTS Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's only ten of those things on Earth! I guess nine, now. 
VICKERS I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't compromise my standard of living. He accommodated me. 
HOLLOWAY I know, I had to cut my manifest. This used to be the number four cargo bay. 
VICKERS What can I do for you, Professor? 
Holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him. 
HOLLOWAY We're about to reach the system periphery. I thought you'd want to see the search protocols we - 
VICKERS No. I was set to be the next CEO of Weyland Industries. Then you came along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this. So here I am. Out of the running. I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask me to play along. 
WATTS But when you get back... 
VICKERS I'll be five years behind the curve. Out of touch. Over. 
HOLLOWAY You might make the discovery of the ages. 
Vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child. 
HOLLOWAY (CONT'D) You don't believe in what we're doing. 
VICKERS Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough. 
She walks them toward the door. Interview's over. 
VICKERS (CONT'D) Now we're out of communication, you can tell the crew what we're doing. 
WATTS They don't know? They volunteered. 
VICKERS They volunteered blind. Classified job, triple pay. 
CARGO BAY 
The crew - Brick, Glasse, Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov - sit on crates in an improvised lecture hall. Holloway and Watts in front of them. Janek at the back of the room.

As they walk toward camera, they glance around the bank with a professional casualness, but obviously very much impressed. Their eyes rove around the place and finally land on some object where they stop. 
CUT TO: 
52. CLOSEUP - CHARLIE 
As he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills. 
CUT TO: 
53. CLOSE SHOT - THREE RACKETEERS 
Their eyes glisten. Their mouths water, as they watch Charlie off scene. 
CUT TO: 
54. MEDIUM SHOT 
Inside the railing. Cluett emerges from his office and starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly stops in his tracks. 
55. CLOSEUP - CLUETT 
He stares off at the racketeers. A look of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse is to turn back. 
56. CLOSE GROUP SHOT 
The three gangsters. A quick flash. Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly at him. 
LEADER 
There he is! Good morning! 
57. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CLUETT 
He changes his mind about avoiding them. His face breaks into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches the three men, his hand outstretched in forced amiability. 
CLUETT 
(shaking) 
Good morning! Who do you want to see? 
The gangsters shake hands with him, their expressions remaining unchanged, which adds immeasurably to Cluett's discomfort. 
LEADER 
(flatly) 
You. 
1ST GANGSTER 
(drawling) 
Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a big deal. 
There is a sinister significance in the manner in which he emphasizes "a big deal." Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease. 
CLUETT 
(uncertainly - sickly smile) 
Oh, yes. Well, come right this way. 
He opens the swinging gate in front of him, permitting the three racketeers to enter. They start for Cluett's office. 
58. INT. ANTE ROOM DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Helen sits at her typewriter near a railing, overlooking the bank below. Another girl stands by her, both are staring off scene. 
CUT TO: 
59. INT. BANK LOBBY - MED. LONG SHOT 
From Helen's angle. 
Cluett and the three gangsters going into Cluett's office. 
60. INT. ANTE ROOM OF DICKSON'S OFFICE - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Helen and other secretary. 
HELEN 
Hey Pat, come here! Look! 
SECRETARY 
(to Helen) 
That's Dude Finlay, all right - I've seen his picture in the papers hundreds of times. 
HELEN 
I wonder what he's doing with Mr. Cluett. 
SECRETARY 
(still staring - thrilled - shuddering) 
Gee, I'm scared. He's one of the toughest gangsters in town. 
CUT TO: 
61. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MED. LONG SHOT 
Shooting down the length of the table. The men are all sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet. 
DICKSON 
(firmly) 
Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time. There'll be no merger. 
62. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As Dickson continues. 
DICKSON 
(the injustice kills him) 
Why should I turn this bank over to anybody else? I've worked twenty-five years night and day to build it up, and now you're asking me to dump it into somebody's lapÂ— 
(with finality) 
Nothing doing! 
Schultz, who is seated near Dickson, looks up at him: 
SCHULTZ 
You can make a handsome profit on your stock. 
DICKSON 
I'm not interested in profits. I'm interested in the bank. In the depositors. They're my friends. They're looking to me for protection, and I'm not walking out on them. 
Clark and O'Brien, also seated around close to Dickson. 
CLARK 
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans! 
O'BRIEN 
(admonishing him) 
Take it easy, Clark. 
Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes alarmed. 
IVES 
(still trying) 
My dear friends . . . 
DICKSON 
(unruffled, paying no attention to Ives) 
It's all right. Let him go ahead. Let him speak his piece. I like it. Go on. 
CLARK 
All right. I'll speak my piece. Dickson, you've got to change your policy. 
63. CLOSER SHOT

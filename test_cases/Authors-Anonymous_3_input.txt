FADE IN: 
1   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- HOLLYWOOD - DAY 
North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree- lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex set back from the curb. 
CAPTION: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA 
Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30). 
HENRY (V.O.) This is where where F. Scott Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940. 
INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century. Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon. This Side of Paradise. And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing movies that never got made. Drinking too much. Alienating people. Losing his way. 
2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY 
Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope. Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment, more with reverence than curiosity. 
CAPTION: HENRY OBERT 
HENRY (V.O.) I stop by here sometimes--out of respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing gift. 
3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS 
Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He unlocks the car. Swings open the back door. 
HENRY (V.O.) But he wasted it. He wasted his talent. 
Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One last glance at the fabled apartment complex. 
HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I sell my novel, I won't make his mistakes. 
4   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain. 
CAPTION: DR. ALAN & COLETTE MOONEY 
They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera. 
ALAN We thought this was going to be a reality series. 
COLETTE You know, like the Kardashians. 
They listen.    Here comes the bad news. 
ALAN Oh. Really? A documentary? This is going to be a documentary about our writing group? 
COLETTE The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about us... 
Nervous laugh. 
ALAN No. 
They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask their disappointment. 
COLETTE So this is going to be like--like what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating. 
ALAN Or that, um, that one about the Holocaust. 
Colette nods, remembering.

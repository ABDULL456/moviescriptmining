Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city, most of them are of the damage caused by V. 
LEADER Gentlemen, I will hear your reports now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye. 
Conrad Heyer appears on one of the screens.  He is at his desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems. 
CONRAD We have less than two minutes of usable footage, Leader.  It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger's vice patrol. 
On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey from one of the pole-mounted cameras. 
CONRAD As you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary.  As is his strength. 
As the last body falls, V seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera. 
LEADER Freeze it! 
The Leader stares at the smiling face. 
CONRAD I'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible. 
LEADER Mr. Etheridge, report for the Ear! 
Bunny Etheridge appears on another screen.  Behind him, huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly. 
ETHERIDGE We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks.  We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions.  All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond. 
LEADER Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for the Nose. 
Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of the fireworks launch. 
FINCH Thanks to Etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks.  These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home-made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader, he's good. 
LEADER Thank you for that professional annotation. 
An intercom opens. 
LIEUTENANT (V.O.) Leader, Mr. Almond has arrived. 
LEADER Very good.  Gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments.  England prevails. 
They answer in unison as Almond enters the office.  His face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye. 
The Leader turns in his chair. 
LEADER Mr. Almond, do you know what this is behind me? 
ALMOND Uh... the Fate computer system, sir? 
LEADER No.  No sir.  It's more than that. This, this computer is a symbol, Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. Do you know what that goal is, Mr. Almond? 
Almond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk. 
LEADER Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right! 
He moves around the desk at Almond. 
LEADER Without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal.  Control, Mr. Almond.  The control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years.  Now, do you understand what happened last night? 
ALMOND We... lost control. 
LEADER Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night someone did the unthinkable. Someone hurt us.  It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. I want that man found, Mr. Almond. I want his head or, by god, I'll have yours. 
INT.  SHADOW GALLERY 
Evey is wearing a blindfold and V leads her by her fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing... 
His fingers slip free of her and she reaches out. 
EVEY Wait.  I've lost you. 
V No, you haven't. 
He is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his house to her. 
EVEY Oh... 
It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and rooms. 
The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics, literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane, philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of nonfiction. 
There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes. 
A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD collection of music. 
EVEY A jukebox?  Where did you get it? 
V I saved it.  Like everything here. 
She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing. 
EVEY Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never heard anything like it. 
V Of course not.  You grew up in their world.  Art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think. 
EVEY This place is amazing. 
V You're welcome to stay. 
She stops suddenly and looks at him.  The offer is terribly exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that it's almost impossible to imagine. 
EVEY Stay here... with you? 
V Yes.  If you like. 
EVEY I... I don't even know your name. 
V I don't have a name.  But you can call me V. 
EVEY V?  V... I like that. 
And she returns his smile.

FADE IN: 
CARD OVER: SANDERSON PRISON 
EXT. PRISON YARD - TITLES OVER - DAY 
DOC McCOY IS BEING WALKED ACROSS THE COMPOUND BY A UNIFORMED GUARD, carrying a riot gun. Other Prisoners around the yard turn and stare as the two men head for the main building. 
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR 
DOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to enter the room where he stands sentry. 
INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY 
A LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing the length of the room. 
Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man; floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J. BEYNON. 
Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Another table has been set up; this one near the seated Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin. 
A MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat, then begins to speak. 
CHAIRMAN I think we can begin... First parole request Carter "Doc" McCoy... is legal counsel present? 
A MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table. 
LAWYER Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr. McCoy. 
DOC watching... taking it all in. 
AT THE TABLE 
The Man checks the papers before him. 
CHAIRMAN (his voice a bored drone) Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery... 
LAWYER The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction, Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr. McCoy in connection with that case. 
CHAIRMAN (adjusting his papers) That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has served four years of his sentence. Prison record satisfactory. Applied for parole on September 5th of this year... 
The Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer. 
CHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) Remarks? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAWYER We would only again like to call the committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's satisfactory behavior as a prisoner. 
CHAIRMAN Notice is taken. 
He looks down the table at the dark-suited men. 
CHAIRMAN (CONT'D) (continuing) The Board met in closed chambers last week... have you reached a decision regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole? 
DOC His face is taut. 
AT THE TABLE 
A Second MAN looks across to the Chairman. 
SECOND MAN (seated near Beynon) Request for parole is denied. The prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year. 
DOC lowers his eyes, then looks up at his lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance., he shuffles the papers in front of him, begins stuffing them into his briefcase. 
AT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE 
CHAIRMAN (still totally without emotion) Very well. The next request for parole is from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?

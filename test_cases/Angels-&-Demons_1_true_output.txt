-- two huge, modern glass doors WHOOSH open, revealing what looks like a 23rd century library.     It's a massive underground space, like a darkened airplane hangar, with a dozen glass boxes evenly spaced throughout.     They're lit up from within, each containing row upon row of bookshelves, neatly filled with books, papers, and arcana. 
LT. CHARTRAND, a twenty-five year old member of the Swiss Guard (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads Langdon and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures. 
CHARTRAND (Swiss accent) The chambers are hermetic vaults, oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.    It's a partial vacuum inside. More than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing apparatus. 
He stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign on its door -- "Il Processo Galileano." 
CHARTRAND (cont'd) I'll be just outside the door. 
Langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault, but Chartrand puts a hand on his chest, stopping him. 
CHARTRAND (cont'd) Watching you, Mr. Langdon. 
Langdon looks at him.    He's not popular around here. 
INT      GALILEO VAULT      DAY 
The electronic revolving door spins and admits Langdon to the interior of the vault. He takes a deep breath, holds it, and lets it out. 
Vittoria follows shortly behind him, and she's unprepared -- the lack of oxygen hits her hard, she dizzies. 
LANGDON Take a moment.     If you feel double vision, double over. 
VITTORIA (bends over) Feels like I'm... scuba diving... with the wrong mixture. 
LANGDON Plenty of time. 
He checks his watch.   It's 7:07. 
LANGDON (cont'd) Uh... actually, I take that back.

INT     A DARK SPACE       DAY 
In a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of hot water.    An elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual suit, no tie, HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea.    No idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about MR. GRAY. 
The tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of sterno.    While Mr. Gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something to his right. 
Money.    A lot of it, in a number of different denominations, neatly segmented in a briefcase.    And three passports, all different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it. 
Satisfied, Mr. Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it under the table, tucking it up against the wall.    He removes the cup from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag. 
He walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls.    He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped cardinals. 
He stops at the last cell, where the man, CARDINAL LAMASSE, looks up at him from the wooden bench he's sitting on. 
MR. GRAY You have no idea what you're missing. 
LAMASSE Conclave will go on without us.    The voice of God will not be silenced. 
MR. GRAY I was referring to my tea.    Last chance, I'd be happy to make you a cup. 
LAMASSE May God forgive you for what you've done. 
MR. GRAY Father, if God has issues they won't be with what I've done -- (seems genuinely saddened) -- but with what I'm about to do. 
A MOMENT LATER, 
Mr. Gray's hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into a fireplace, where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry kindling.    He picks up something else and places it in the heart of the flames. 
A long-handled iron rod.

INT     VATICAN ARCHIVES       DAY 
Inside the archive, Vittoria is searching the lower shelves while Langdon, on a ladder, digs through folio bins higher up. 
LANGDON -- confiscated from the Netherlands by the Vatican shortly after Galileo's death.     I've been petitioning to see it for almost ten years.     Ever since I realized what was in it. 
VITTORIA What makes you so sure the Segno is there? 
LANGDON (while searching) The number 503.    I kept seeing it over and over in llluminati letters, scribbled in the margins, or sometimes just signed that way, "503."      It's a numerical clue, but to what?     Five, of course, is the sacred llluminati number -- the pentagram, Pythagoras, a dozen other examples in science -- but why three? (MORE) 
LANGDON (cont'd) It made no sense. And then I thought -- what if it were a Roman numeral? 
VITTORIA (THINKS) D-I-I-I? 
LANGDON D3.   Galileo's third text. (ticking them off) Dialogo.    Discorsi. 
His eyes light up as he pulls a slender volume out of a folio bin on one of the top shelves. 
LANGDON (cont'd) Diagramma. 
A MOMENT LATER, 
Langdon, now wearing white cotton gloves, sets the tiny manuscript on a viewing stand. 
LANGDON Diagramma della Verita.        The Diagram of Truth. 
VITTORIA I know about Dialogo and Discorsi -- Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun, and the church forced him to recant. But what was this? 
LANGDON This is where he got the word out. The truth, not what the Vatican forced him to write.    Smuggled out of Rome and printed in Holland on sedge papyrus. That way any scientists caught with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve. 
Carefully, he turns the first page. 
LANGDON (cont'd) Between its delicate nature and the Vatican burnings, it's said this is the only copy that remains. (turns the second page) (MORE) 
LANGDON (cont'd) And if I'm right the Segno should be hidden -- (and the third) -- on page number -- (and the fourth) -- five.

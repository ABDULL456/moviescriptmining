YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) But just 211 miles away stands the great city of Zootopia! Where our ancestors first joined together in peace, and declared that anyone can be anything! Thank you and good night! 
Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned. 
EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY 
A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream. 
STU HOPPS Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy? 
YOUNG JUDY Nope. 
STU HOPPS Well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled, right Bon? 
BONNIE HOPPS Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We settled hard. 
STU HOPPS See, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude. If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail. 
YOUNG JUDY I like trying, actually. 
BONNIE HOPPS What your father means, hon, is it's gonna be difficult-- impossible even-- for you to become a police officer. 
STU HOPPS Right. There's never been a bunny cop. 
BONNIE HOPPS No. 
STU HOPPS Bunnies don't do that. 
BONNIE HOPPS Never. 
STU HOPPS Never. 
YOUNG JUDY Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be the first one. Because I am gonna make the world... (parkours against a vendor's stand) A better place! 
STU HOPPS OR... um, heck, you wanna talk about making the world a better place-- 
The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which is manned by too many children to count. 
STU HOPPS (CONT'D) --no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer. 
BONNIE HOPPS Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters-- we're changing the world. 
STU HOPPS Yep. 
BONNIE HOPPS One carrot at a time... 
STU HOPPS Amen to that. Carrot farming is a noble profession. 
Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously. 
BONNIE HOPPS (O.S.) Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in the ground. 
STU HOPPS (O.S.) Ahh, at one with the soil. 
We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now. 
BONNIE HOPPS You get it. I mean, it's great to have dreams. 
STU HOPPS Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in em too much. (finally noticing Judy's absence) Where in the heck'd she go? 
ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA. 
GIDEON GREY Gimme your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt. 
SHARLA Ow! Cut it out, Gideon! 
GIDEON GREY Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry? 
Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets. 
YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) Hey! 
Judy charges toward the danger. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) You heard her. Cut it out. 
Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny Clint Eastwood.

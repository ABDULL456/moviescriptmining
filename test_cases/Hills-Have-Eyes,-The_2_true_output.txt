BOBBY (CONT'D) .or was it five? Bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert. Big Bob grabs another gun from the car, A 44 CHROME PLATED 
MAGNUM. 
BIG BOB (with a big smile) I'd like to see how they stack up against this... Ethel brings her husband's jacket and helps him put it on. 
ETHEL Some things never change... 
BIG BOB (loading his weapon) I'll take my bullets over your prayers any day. 
BOBBY You think we'll see scorpions and coyotes? Big.Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud. They look like two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun- 
BOBBY (CONT'D) Hey Doug, wanna try?

DOUG 
(SMILING) Oh no! No thanks buddy... 
BOBBY Come on, just one shot, it makes you feel kinda powerful. Big Bob answers for Doug- 
BIG BOB Leave him alone son. Doug is a liberal, he wouldn't touch a gun... Obviously, the two men disagree. Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra revealing a sexy body. She applies suntan lotion ready to kill some time. Behind her sunglasses, she observes the silent desert looking like Paris Hilton. Lynn exits the trailer and joins her. 
LYNN Catherine just fell asleep. How are you holding up? 
BRENDA 
(IRONICALLY) Thrilled to be here! 
LYNN Yeah, this is a total drag, especially with a baby. 
BRENDA I don't care what they say, next year, I'm going to Cancun with my friends. No more "family trips" for me... 
LYNN We're not going to have many more trips like this together... As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a job. 
BRENDA C'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket.

BRENDA (CONT'D) Don't you think? Please, for your poor little sister... Doug's voice interrupts. 
DOUG (O.S.) Lynn, can you bring me my jacket honey? Lynn gets up and returns to the trailer. 
BRENDA (imitating her sister) "Right away, honey..." Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger. Brenda smiles with satisfaction. 
30 INT. TRAILER - DAY 30 
Lynn finds her husband's jacket and stops when she sees a cigarette butt in the sink. She's pissed. She picks it up and throws it away. A FLASH OF LIGHT catches her attention outside. She looks through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of light coming from the top of the hills when- 
BOBBY JUMPS UP AT THE WINDOW SCREAMING! Lynn falls back against.the kitchen table scared to death. Bobby laughs, pleased with himself. Annoyed, Lynn shuts the blinds in his face.

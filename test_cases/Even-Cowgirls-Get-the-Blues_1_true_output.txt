DELORES My sacred crocodile! She's flipped. 
But in a minute, others follow Debbie, everyone of them, in fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young cowgirls, squealing, giggling, They slide and roll on the wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough. 
The cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the rain goes away. Play ceases. They are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one another's hair. 
ELAINE I move that the meeting be adjourned. 
DEBBIE At the end of the endless game, there is friendship. 
HEATHER What the heck did she mean by that! 
JELLY Just that in Heaven all business is conducted this way. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY NIGHT 
In the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing Sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress. Very formal looking for her. 
There is Julian standing in the lobby. He turns and walks toward Sissy. He is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund. He extends his hand to meet her, and (perhaps at the sight of Sissy's thumbs) Julian has an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her. 
Sissy doesn't know whether to assist Julian or flee. 
From the other side of the lobby, two WELL-GROOMED COUPLES, white, mid-thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue. The younger of the men, RUPERT, takes charge. He breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under Julian's nose. 
RUPERT We'd better take you home. 
In the red of embarrassment, Julian looks more Indian than he had previously. Wheezing, he speaks: 
JULIAN I beg your pardon. I've been enthralled with your photographs for years. When the Countess hinted that you might like to meet me -- he never explained why -- I was ready to paint for him free of charge. And now I had to go and spoil it. 
EXT. STREET NIGHT 
Rupert is helping Julian to the street. Rupert is a salesman for a publishing house. His wife Carla, a homemaker, as they say. The other couple breaks down into Howard and Marie Barth, both copywriters for an ad agency. 
Howard hails a cab and Carla and Marie flutter around Sissy. 
MARIE This is dreadful. (lowering her voice confidentially) You know, asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress. Poor Julian is so high strung. The excitement of meeting you -- my dear, you look so stunning! -- must have upset his chemical balance. 
Carla nods. Everyone is piling into the taxi. 
RUPERT Come on, Sissy, don't be afraid of us. 
SISSY I've never ridden in a cab. The whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt. 
Sissy is forced to suffer the indignity of riding in a vehicle she wasn't responsible for flagging with her own thumbs. 
CARLA It'll be all right, dear. It isn't as serious as it sounds.

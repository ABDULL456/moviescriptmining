Triton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel. Sebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . .  [sotto] If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . .

Great father who loves us and named us well: Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.

Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy. Scuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this. Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.

You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over! Ariel: A dinglehopper! Flounder: What about that one? Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.  This is wonderful! A banded, bulbous - snarfblat. Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh. Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me. (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.) Ariel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me! Flounder: The concert was today? Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin'. Ariel: Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.)

Sebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy. Ariel: I gotta see him again - tonight!  Scuttle knows where he lives. Sebastian: Ariel - please.

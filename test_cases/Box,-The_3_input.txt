INTO CHAOS... 
INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT 
Arthur is now standing at the urinal. He begins to hear commotion outside. He turns his head to the left... when something COLD and METAL locks itself around his wrist. Arthur turns back to the right and sees that it is Robert Bevilacqua. He is standing at the urinal next to him and they are now HAND-CUFFED TOGETHER at the wrists. Bevilacqua retrieves a GUN from his pocket at points it at Arthur. He has dark circles under his eyes. 
BEVILACQUA You can still save yourself. It's too late for me... but you can still save yourself. 
ARTHUR Bevilacqua... 
BEVILACQUA Follow me out through the kitchen. I have a truck waiting...

Walter walks down the driveway as several POLICE OFFICERS rush past him, moving toward the entrance of the house. The whole place is being evacuated... He looks toward the square... and begins to move in that direction. The CAMERA drifts back toward the ROCK PILLAR that stands at the entrance to the house. Arlington is standing there in front of it. He is wearing his black hat... pulled down low. He begins to follow Walter toward the square...

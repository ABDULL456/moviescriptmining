BOX Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. (pointing to the frosted ice wall) It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea...And then it stopped coming and they (gesture) came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea 
Logan pulls out his gun. 
LOGAN Tell us how to get out...or IÂ¹ll destroy you..I'll kill you! 
Box laughs...The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier.  Then: 
BOX (calmly) Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand you facing one another. Box starts his saw hand BUZZING.  He turns all the flesh parts of his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica who is now standing behind Logan. 
Box is now like an armed vehicle. 
Logan FIRES...the fire reflecting harmlessly off Box's metal frame. 
BOX (advancing) Resign yourself. 
255		MED. ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Retreating...as Logan FIRES again and again...to no avail. 
As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and: 
256		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX 
Advancing 
We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSON...embedded in the clear wall of ice. A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama. 
257		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as: 
258		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX 
Relentlessly moving toward them. 
259		TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall. 
Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or button which might open it. 
The entire time he never takes his eyes off: 
260		REVERSE ANGLE - BOX 
Getting closer. The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY. 
BOX (chilling tone) I make such a small, quick incision ... you can hardly feel it. 
261		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Against the rear wall...We can SEE...but they cannot...that above them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables. 
262		FULL ANGLE - LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX Box is practically upon them.  As he lunges forward with his WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her. 
Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as: 
Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. He misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling. 
There is an EXPLOSION. 
BOX (looking up; screaming) No! The coils! 
Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures. 
BOX (still screaming) All my work!' All my work!! 
As Logan and Jessica stand: 
263-270	OUT 270x1	ANGLE - THE REFRIGERANT COILS 
Bursting open, discharging great streams of gases. 
270x2	LOGAN 
Seeing the effect, shooting again and again at the ceiling and walls. 
270x3	ANOTHER ANGLE Coils bursting everywhere, vapor billowing into the cavern. 270x4	ANOTHER ANGLE Huge slabs of ice instantly loosening, crashing over. 270x5	FULL SHOT 
AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing. 
270x6	BOX

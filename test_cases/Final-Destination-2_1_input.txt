Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP... 
EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - CONTINUOUS 
Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped onto Kat's door. 
THOMAS Where's the cell phone Clear gave you? 
RORY I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place. 
THOMAS Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella. 
Thomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves, Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket. 
Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the Expedition. 
KIMBERLY You doing alright in there? 
KAT My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji? 
The KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to death. 
KAT Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal? 
Brian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway. 
CUT TO: 
THE DRIP 
Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed dirt, around debris, toward the crash site. 
BACK TO: 
THOMAS DARK ROOM 
Speaks to another COP who clicks off his radio. 
COP She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now. 
THOMAS Where's that? 
COP A few miles up the road.   Near the docks. 
KAT 
Lights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor. 
KAT Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing? 
RESCUE WORKER (dripping scorn) Sure, I'll just set it to the "quiet" mode. 
Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales. KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure. 
MEANWHILE 
The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site... 
KIMBERLY 
Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward Kimberly. 
THOMAS We gotta go now.   Isabella's in labor. 
Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat Flinches. 
KIMBERLY What about that? 
CLEAR (calls over to Kat) How you doing in there, hero? 
KAT (re: spike behind head) I guess it could be worse. 
Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers. 
THOMAS So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?! 
Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading directly under the dead Oak Tree. 
Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he delicately unfolds it... 
KIMBERLY 
Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there. 
KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat! Everyone applauds!

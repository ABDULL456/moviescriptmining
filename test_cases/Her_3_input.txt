SAMANTHA Sure, send them over. 
Theodore pushes the send button. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet. 
THEODORE Yeah. 
As she reads, we intercut with close-ups of the handwritten words and photos of the couple on Theodore's computer screen. 
SAMANTHA "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body - 
THEODORE (interrupting) No, you don't have to read it out loud. 
SAMANTHA Okay. 
Beat. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 17 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE I mean, you could if you want. 
SAMANTHA Okay. "Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess." 
We hear Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) "And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. (beat) I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit. 
The letters show back up on Theodore's desktop. 
THEODORE No, these are great. 
SAMANTHA Really? 
THEODORE Thank you. 
Theodore sorts through them, prints them out. 
SAMANTHA So to write your letter, what did Roger send you? 
THEODORE (distracted) He just said he was in Prague on a business trip and he missed Rachel. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                        pg. 18 CONTINUED: (2) 
SAMANTHA How did you know about her crooked little tooth? 
THEODORE I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them. 
SAMANTHA That's very sweet. (beat) Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes. 
THEODORE Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good. 
SAMANTHA Yes, I am. 
INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT LOBBY - EVENING 
Theodore, carrying a bag and a smoothie, enters the lobby and is greeted by a couple in their 30s, AMY and CHARLES, who are waiting for the elevator. 
THEODORE Hey, you guys, how's it going? 
AMY Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week? 
THEODORE Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook? 
AMY That sounds about right. 
THEODORE Hey, Charles. 
CHARLES Good to see you, Theodore. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 19 CONTINUED:

The Assistant fixes Fox a drink from a portable bar. Fox throws it down and gives the glass back to the Assistant. 
PETER Do you have a daughter? FOX Yes.    I do.    A little girl. PETER Does she have a little toy wagon? 
FOX Yes.    I think she does.    Yes.   Why? PETER I'll have a Scotch and water.                                * FOX Good.    Good.   Get in. They get into the limo. 115    INT. MOTOR VEHICLE OFFICE - COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT                115

ASSISTANT (O.S.) Too many. YOUNG MAN (O.S.) I could lose my job for this. What are you going to do with this information? 116    ANGLE - FOX'S ASSISTANT AND YOUNG MAN                              116 
ASSISTANT You'll read all about it in the newspapers. Come on. Let's do R.E., R.P. and R.B. and see what we get. 
117   EXT. LONG ISLAND SUBURB - ED RIFKIN - DAY                  117 is in his driveway sipping a beer and painting a "For Sale" sign. An '81 Corvette is parked in the driveway. 
RIFKIN Henry Lamb?   Who's that? 
118   ANGLE TO INCLUDE PETER FALLOW AND RIFKIN                   118 
PETER He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In your English class. RIFKIN He was?   What's he done? 
PETER He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper. RIFKIN Oh.   I don't remember him. 
PETER What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was. RIFKIN Well, if I don't remember him, I guess he was okay. PETER Would you say he was a 'good' student? RIFKIN 'Good' doesn't really apply to Ruppert High. They're either cooperative or life-threatening. There's no in-between. 
PETER His mother says he was considering going to college. 
RIFKIN Well, she means City College. They have an open admissions policy. So, if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and you're still breathing, they have to take you. (CONTINUED) 
118   CONTINUED:                                                118 PETER Well, is there anything at all you can tell me about his performance or aptitude -- anything at all? RIFKIN Look, Mr...? 
PETER Fallow. 
RIFKIN I got sixty-five students in every class... 
PETER Do you have any of his written work? RIFKIN Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any written work at Ruppert High since... oh, fifteen years. Maybe twenty. PETER Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others... RIFKIN No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher. 
PETER (pauses; then) Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an honors student? 
RIFKIN Well, he never pissed on me. So by that standard, yes. I guess he must be.

SHERMAN (O.S.) I think you're exaggerating the situation, Bernard... 
120    ANGLE - SHERMAN                                           120

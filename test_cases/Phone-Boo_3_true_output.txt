LEON Me?  You're the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs. 
STU I'm terminal, okay?  Now can I close the booth and continue my conversation? 
LEON I'm worried now it might be catching.  All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease. 
STU Fine.  Give it back. 
LEON What good's that?  We done touched it. 
STU Well go wash your hands. 
LEON Come on now.  Own up to what you're carrying.  Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit?  Cause in that case, we can relax. 
STU I'm sick of you.  Now get out of my face. 
LEON Here we's being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse! 
FELICIA Whip his arrogant ass. 
Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket. 
STU Touch me and I'll throw up on you. 
At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly. 
It looks like a stalemate.  Stu isn't vacating the booth and Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further.  He does indeed look sick. 
STU (into pay phone) You can see what I'm up against here. 
VOICE Want me to get rid of him for you? 
STU What do you have in mind? 
VOICE I'll think of something. 
Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp. 
Leon doesn't realize it's there.  The hooker behind him has no way of seeing it.  But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. He reacts. 
STU God -- no. (into pay phone) Don't.  It's not necessary. 
VOICE You asked for my help. 
STU I'll handle it myself. 
VOICE You're not doing too well.  I can settle it in a fraction of a second.  Shall I demonstrate? 
STU No. (to Leon) For your own safety, mister, just walk away. 
LEON Now the man is turning aggressive... issuing threats upon my person. 
STU You're making this happen. 
LEON If you don't hang up and step out, I'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it. 
Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its foundation.  And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It starts rocking back and forth. 
Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing. 
STU (into pay phone) This isn't my fault. (shouts) Stop that!

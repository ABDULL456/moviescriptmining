DARREN Destiny? That doesn't make sense. 
CREPSLEY Try this then. You're reckless enough to steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. That's enough for me. 
DARREN Not for me. 
CREPSLEY Yes, well, destiny can't be explained. It must be lived. Now, you're wasting my time. 
DARREN There's gotta be another way. 
CREPSLEY There isn't. 
DARREN Please... He's my friend. 
CREPSLEY And he slips away while we argue. Life or death? Yes or no? 
DARREN You'd never be able to trust me. If I got a chance for payback I'd take it. 
CREPSLEY Yes or no? Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods. Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially long, but they look thick and sharp. Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it. 
CREPSLEY You have good blood. Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers. Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers. 
CREPSLEY Lift your hands. Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain. 
CREPSLEY Get used to pain. More lies ahead. He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread. Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers. As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation. 
CREPSLEY The blood flows into your left arm and out of your right. Do you feel it? Getting near your heart? Darren nods, shivers. 
CREPSLEY Almost there. A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down. 
Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering. Tries to block out any sympathy he feels. 
CREPSLEY The world will start to slow down. You'll become a witness of time. (snaps out of it) Your friend's time is running out. He pulls Darren to his feet. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ZEITERION THEATER - NIGHT 
They step out into the moonlight. Darren a little wobbly. 
CREPSLEY Take my arm. Don't let go. Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet. Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look. The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past. A moment later and they're in the... 
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT Crepsley pulls loose Darren's hand. They're still bleeding. 
CREPSLEY Lick your fingers. Vampire spit will stop wounds from bleeding. Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot. 
DARREN How'd we get here? 
CREPSLEY It's called flitting. Which room is your friend in? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOSPITAL - STEVE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Tubes run in and out of Steve. His breathing is labored. 
Crepsley leans over him, rolls up one of Steve's eyelids. Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye. 
CREPSLEY We're in time. He still has a few minutes left. Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork. He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm. A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs twitching. Is he dying? 
DARREN What's happening? 
CREPSLEY He was near death. The journey back is not pleasant. What do you know about him, this boy with bad blood? 
DARREN He's my friend.

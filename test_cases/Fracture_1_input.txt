WILLY He is!   You have to get us DOWN! 
PILOT Get back in your goddamn seat! 
CRAWFORD Willy, I'm not doing anything. Everyone can see that. 
WILLY I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK! He's DOING SOMETH- An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator. Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it - 
WILLY What's happening?! 
MED TECH I don't know - I'm - there's a - malfunction - - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his glare: oh, you bastard. Crawford almost smiles. 
The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires - 
MED TECH I can't do anything with this, up here. The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes Jennifer's breathing tube and prepares to begin C.P.R. - 
CRAWFORD She's D.N.R. The Med Tech looks up - startled.     Confused. 
WILLY What is it? 
CRAWFORD Check. Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his paperwork, searching it - 
WILLY What? The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared. 
MED TECH She's Do Not Resuscitate. Willy turns on Crawford.   He shrugs. 
CRAWFORD It's in her living will. The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed. 
MED TECH She's D.N.R.    She signed it. 
WILLY There's a restraining order - she's protected - I'm authorizing you to do it! The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain - 
CRAWFORD No extraordinary measures. (Turns to Willy) Unless your court order specifies 
(MORE) 
CRAWFORD (cont'd) contravening her living will. But I don't think it would. I think you got one that forbids me from disconn- Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med Tech grabs him, drags him back - 
PILOT 
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?! - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's stretcher - Willy struggles furiously - 
WILLY Wait!    WAIT - LOOK! Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked - - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent: She's breathing. 
WILLY Yes.     Yes. Willy whirls around to Crawford.        Who's frowning. 
WILLY You messed up. With all your plans and games. Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of her face. Her eyes flutter open - 
WILLY Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right. - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand.        Silent awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear. 
WILLY You're gonna be okay? She squeezes his hand.      Very weakly. Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch. Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.        She fights it. 
WILLY Jennifer?       Hang on. Something sad in her wordless gaze.        As it starts to fade. 
WILLY Jennifer?!     JENNIFER?! She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty.        Her hand becoming lifeless in his. 
WILLY No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back. Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them - feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction. 
WILLY Don't let go. But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes her eyes. Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically. 
CRAWFORD You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have to be here. (Beat) But now you're my witness. You saw: I didn't touch anything, I didn't do anything. The machine went down. Anybody asks - you'll have to tell them. What you saw. (Beat) That's really kind of perfect, isn't it? Willy stares into his eyes. Cold.        Then he looks away.    Out the window, into the sun-glare.

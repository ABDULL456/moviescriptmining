(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She backs off, upset, breathing hard. 
JACK Look, it doesn't matter -- 
JULIA It matters, okay!? You don't... you can't understand... I need that flight recorder. I need to know what happened. 
(BEAT) You need to know what happened. 
JACK We should stay close to... She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder Jack saw. It's also gone. 
JACK (CONT'D) What was it? She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle. 
INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria has tried to ignore the cam feeds, working on other things. She glances over, then away just as a FORM passes by one of the cam feeds! Victoria checks another readout, glances back as TWO MORE FORMS pass by the camera. Glimpses of metal and fur... 
VICTORIA (hitting the Comm) Jack! Jack! There's something coming your way. JACK!!" 
TNT. CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS Jack's Bubbleship sits silent. The COMM still switched off. Suddenly ANOTHER FORM moves through our line of sight, something's there, and CLOSE. WITH JACK and JULIA. The air still, damp. Almost no sound. She picks through the remains of the ship. He's staring at her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JULIA (without looking up) You're staring at me. 
JACK I'm sorry. INTERCUT: Victoria watches as MORE AND MORE Alien figures pass the camera feed. Moving towards Jack and Julia's position. Victoria, HELPLESS. Julia looks up at Jack, directly for the first time. He stares at her... 
JACK (CONT'D) How do I know you... ON JULIA'S FACE. Suddenly her vision racks... JACK SPINS, sees emerging out of the mist, SCAVS. A dozen of them. Alien tribesmen, bristling with weapons, war-like high-tech headdresses. Mandibles and claws. Terrifying and close. Jack reaches for his weapon, bringing it around and -- SLAM! He's hit from the side by a SCAV. Its armored body bringing him to the ground. He tries to CRAWL AWAY, sees Julia grabbed. He twists, sees Scavs crawling over the Bubbleship. 
JACK (CONT'D) Bob! HOME! In the background, the Bubbleship BLASTS OFF, Scavs falling off as Jack KICKS BACKWARDS, breaking the Scavs hold. He rolls away towards his weapon- - straight into the legs of a GIANT SCAV holding an improvised club which now comes down, IMPACTING JACK... 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
VICTORIA stares at image of the wreck growing SMALLER as the Bubbleship rises. 
VICTORIA 
JACK! JACK...! 
EXT. OPEN LAND - DAWN 
Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses of earth moving by, then darkness again. Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses. Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize: The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward. We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal... The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain. 
INT. SKY TOWER - MORNING 
Victoria hears the SOUND OF THE BUBBLESHIP, arriving. She rushes to the glass of the Sky Tower, sees the Bubbleship, docking itself. Auto pilot. No one inside. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN CANYONS - MORNING 
From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and steel. Something giant and industrial in its time. The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under a shadowy outcropping of rock. In the dark underneath, huge metal doors... close. 
INT. A DARK SPACE -- NO TIME 
Almost complete blackness, just the SOUND of a slow drip of water. In the far distance, the howls and chatter of Scavs. Jack's blood-encrusted eyes blink open. Irises dilate trying to orient. He raises his head, can barely see.

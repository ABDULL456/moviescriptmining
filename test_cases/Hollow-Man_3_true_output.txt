Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting. 
MATT (cont'd) This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I were him I'd do the same thing. 
Matt goes back to kissing Linda. 
LINDA Let me ask another question. 
MATT Is about who gets to be on top? 
LINDA Is the human race really ready for what we're doing? 
Matt groans and rolls over. 
MATT Why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical? 
LINDA No really. Is it ready? We're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I don't think we can answer. 
MATT They said the same thing about the bomb. They said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are. 
LINDA This night is still young. (beat) I mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye? 
MATT We made our deal with the devil years ago. Might as well stick around to cash in. 
INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY 
Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock on the door. 
SEBASTIAN (his voice catches) Yes? 
Matt sticks his head in. 
MATT We're ready. 
Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods. 
SEBASTIAN Okay. 
MATT It's not too late to back out. I'm happy to take your place. 
SEBASTIAN No. I'm ready. 
Matt leads him into the hallway. 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
As they walk down the corridor toward the lab... 
MATT Nervous? 
SEBASTIAN A little. 
MATT Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman? 
SEBASTIAN I don't think so. 
MATT So Superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League. I mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. So Superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. I could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." After all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. Well ... I tell ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "What the hell was that." And the Invisible Man replies "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell." 
INT. LABORATORY 
Sebastian shoots Matt a look. 
SEBASTIAN You know, that could be the last joke I ever hear. 
MATT C'mon, man. That's funny shit. 
The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She pats Sebastian on the shoulder. 
LINDA O.K. How're you feeling? Sebastian takes a deep breath. 
SEBASTIAN Fine. 
Sarah checks his vitals. 
SARAH Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit elevated. 
SEBASTIAN To be expected. 
SARAH No reason for concern. He's ready. 
Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's almost teary eyed. 
SEBASTIAN Hey... it's gonna be okay.

MANN No, I never slept with her. 
RAY You never slept with who? 
MANN Whoever you were going to ask me about. If I'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said I was with, I'd be in formaldehyde by now. 
RAY 
(INTERESTED) You slept with a lot of famous women? 
MANN 
(SOURLY) What's your question? 
RAY How'd you get a name like Terence? Mann cannot believe that's the question. 
MANN Rastus was taken.

Ray knows now to shut up. He returns his attention to his driving, glances up to his rearview mirror, and sees something that causes his eyes to widen in horror. 
87 REAR-VIEW MIRROR 
A Boston police car on his tail, red lights flashing. 
RAY (O.S.) Oh no. 
88 INT. RAY'S CAR 88 
Mann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back to Ray. Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the ignition. Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle. 
MANN Nice going, Boze. 
RAY Okay. I don't really have a gun. So don't say anything to this guy, okay? I swear to God there's a reason we're supposed to be at this game. Mann gives him a "Give me a break" look. Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them. Ray is desperate. 
RAY If I get arrested, the press'll be all over you, you'll have to appear in open court, you'll be the lead story on Entertainment Tonight, and your picture'll be on the front page of every tabloid in America. The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young, fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him. 
RAY Just a second. 
(-CO MANN) 'Terence-Mann Kidnapped... Also seen in UFO with Elvis.' Mann's eyes narrow. The cop knocks again, more insistently. Ray rolls down-the window."

RAY Sorry. 
POLICEMAN License and registration. Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no idea what Mann will do. The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann. 
POLICEMAN And what's your name,-sir? Mann keeps his face averted. 
MANN Terry. 
POLICEMAN Where is it that you and Raymond are going, Terry? 
RAY Fenway Park! We're going to the ball game. 
MANN (turns to cop) Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped. Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the "Entertainment Tonight" theme song. 
RAY 'Entertainment Tonight, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo... Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly. 
MANN, What I mean by that is, I don't care much for baseball, but Raymond insisted. 
POLICEMAN Yeah, I hate baseball. (hands Ray back 
HIS ID) Your right taillight is out, Raymond. I want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity.

RAY Yes. I will. Thank you. The Policeman walks away, and Ray heaves a sigh of relief. 
RAY 'Terry?' 
MANN 'Raymond?' 
RAY Ray. My...hostages call me Ray. Can I call you Terry? Sourly, Mann nods. Ray smiles and drives off.

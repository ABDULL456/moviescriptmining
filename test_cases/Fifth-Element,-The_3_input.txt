MOTHER (V.O.) Are you listening to me, you ingrate! 
KORBEN (resigned) Yes ma.. 
Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box. 
Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding. 
KORBEN (to the Thai) Go on... This is gonna take a while! 
The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window. 
KORBEN Other than that... You all right? 
MOTHER (V.O.) ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! 
The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food. 
KORBEN (to the cat) I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about? 
MOTHER (V.O.) I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? 
KORBEN All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly.. 
A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on. 
MOTHER (V.O.) You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! 
KORBEN Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. 
MOTHER (V.O.) They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead! 
He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.- 
KORBEN Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back. 
Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a Captain and a Major. MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache. Munro opens a file. 
MUNRO (clipped) Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance. 
KORBEN What mission? 
MUNRO To save the world. 
KORBEN Where have I heard this song before? 
MUNRO You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'? 
KORBEN (a little bewildered) Just one... why me? 
MUNRO Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission. 
Munro pulls out a long list of documents. 
MUNRO Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated. 
KORBEN And the third one? 
MUNRO You're the only one left alive... 
Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at. 
MUNRO Don't you open your messages? 
KORBEN I've had enough good news for today 
MUNRO (by rote) You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets. 
He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it. 
KORBEN You rigged the contest? 
Munro nods. 
MUNRO Major Iceborg will accompany you... as your wife... 
The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick. 
KORBEN (sarcastic) You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet? 
MUNRO Old tricks are the best tricks eh? 
KORBEN I'm not going. 
MUNRO Why not? 
KORBEN One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive. 
110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL 
Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the. number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell. 
110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT 
The doorbell rings. 
KORBEN ...Scuse me. 
Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo. Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

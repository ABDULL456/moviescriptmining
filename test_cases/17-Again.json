{"train": "17 AGAIN \nWritten by \nJason Filardi \nOctober 2007 \nEXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK \nA few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS \nAn empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17. Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic. \nMike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and short shorts circa 1989. \nMustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters. \nCOACH HARVEY Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the game. \nMike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach. \nMIKE Just warming up, Coach. \nCoach Harvey hands Mike a towel. \nCOACH HARVEY First game of the season and the scouts are already lining up. You have half the season I know you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want, Mike. \nMIKE That's the plan coach. \nThe rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. \nCOACH HARVEY Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time. \nThe Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'. \nMIKE Hold on.   Ed's not here yet. \nDOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs- \nDOM Who cares?      He's the water boy. \nMIKE And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture. \nA shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom. \nCOACH HARVEY Hey!   Hey!     Knock it off. \nCoach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his clothes off. \nED Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard... \nCOACH HARVEY ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up. \nEd takes a spot next to Dom. \nPHOTOGRPAHER And 3, 2, 1- \nWE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to: \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT \nThe Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court.    On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up. \nLights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance. \nEd awkwardly tries to imitate Mike. \nCoach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends- \nCOACH HARVEY Alright, Ladies, bring it in! \nThe Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats.     Ed hands waters to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike. \nMike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nED FREEDMAN, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers. ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES protrude from every inch of his body, neck and face...at least 5000 needles. \nA HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him. \nACUPUNCTURIST Can you feel your Qi flowing freely? \nED I'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding. \nMike enters, shakes his head in amusement. \nMIKE What are you doing now? \nEd looks over, sees Mike watching. \nED There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine. Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the rage. Makes you look five years younger. \nEd climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it all over the place. \nED (CONT'D) (calls to Acupuncturist) What's this brown stuff again? \nACUPUNCTURIST Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein. \nED Delish! (to Mike) The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing. \nMIKE Then why are you letting her stick needles in you? \nED Because she's hot. But today's not about me. It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager. \nMIKE I better be. I've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company. \nED No negativity. Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. You, Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a winner. \nMIKE A winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house. \nED Are you kidding?! It doesn't get any better than this! (MORE) \nED (CONT'D) I gotta get back. My legs just went numb. Good luck today. \nEd drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist. \nEXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MORNING \nMike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'. \nINT. WYATT PHARMACEUTICALS/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING \nPHARMACEUTICAL DRUG POSTERS cover the walls.    Smiling faces, happy couples...little pills. \nSurrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues...HOT WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away. \nMike sits amongst them, the only male present. A glum look on his face. WENDY, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him. \nWENDY Congratulations, Mike. You deserve it. You're like a totally amazing salesman. \nMIKE Thanks, Wendy. That like totally means so much to me. \nROGER, 23, boss, strides through the door. \nROGER Good morning, peeps. As you all know, today I'll be naming the new regional sales manager. What's it take to be an RSM? Leadership skills, a comprehensive knowledge of today's prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier. \nMike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket. \nROGER (CONT'D) All being said, congratulations- (Mike begins to rise) Wendy. \nDumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat.    Wendy springs up out of hers, SCREAMING and BOUNCING. \nROGER (CONT'D) Now go out there and sell some drugs peeps! \nThe Women stream out. \nMIKE How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here 2 months!? \nThey make their way towards the door.    Mike limping. \nALEX Why are you limping? \nMIKE Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron. \nINT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - NIGHT \nMike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner.    Alex eats heartily. Maggie quietly pushes her food around. \nMIKE I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start. \nALEX Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape. \nMaggie stifles a laugh. \nMIKE That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are- \nALEX -it's how big you play. \nFather and Son touch fists. \nMIKE And what about you, Mags?   What's new? \nMAGGIE Nothing. \nALEX She got into Georgetown. \nMIKE You did!?    That's fantastic! \nMAGGIE It's no big deal. \nMIKE It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. (Maggie remains quiet) Am I missing something here? \nMAGGIE You wouldn't understand. \nMIKE Try me. \nMAGGIE I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure... \nMIKE That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski... \nMaggie rolls her eyes. \nALEX Did you get the promotion, Dad? \nMIKE Still waiting to hear. \nMike forces a smile hiding his disappointment. \nEXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nMike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain. \nMIKE Is your mom home? \nALEX She's probably out back. \nMIKE Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good? \nMAGGIE I'm counting down the minutes. \nMaggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside. \nMIKE What's with her? \nALEX We see you once a week for a couple hours. What do you expect? \nAlex follows Maggie into the house.   Mike makes his way around back. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY \nAs Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags. \nDOM Hey, Mike. Good to see you.    Tough break, you and Scarlet. \nA FEMALE JANITOR, steps from a room. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor? \nJANITOR I'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here. \nMIKE There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me- \nMike points to the 1989 team photo. \nJANITOR -Of you?   That picture's from 1989. \nMike backs away from the picture and the Janitor. \nMIKE Right.   Forget it. \nConfused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom. He's about to enter, three letter jacket wearing JOCKS, STAN, JAZZ and KEVIN, burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/BATHROOM - DAY \nMike enters, moves to a sink, turns the water on- \nVOICE (o.s.) Can I get a little help in here? \nMike turns, sees what appears to be UNDERWEAR stretched over the corner of a closed stall door. \nMike approaches the door, swings it open...there HANGS Alex, sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground. The back of his underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door. \nMIKE Alex?   What are you doing up there? \nALEX I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus. What do you think I'm doing!? Get me down! \nMIKE Okay.   Okay. I'll get you down. \nMike pulls the underwear off the door.   Alex drops, reaches down his pants, adjusts his underwear. \nALEX How do you know my name? \nMIKE I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you. \nALEX Uncle Ed has a son? \nMIKE Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you? \nALEX Goons from the basketball team. \nMIKE But why? \nALEX Because they can and so they do on a daily basis. \nMIKE (SHOCKED) But you're one of them. \nALEX No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta go. \nAlex walks out bowlegged.   A devastated Mike watches him go. \nINT. AUDI - MOMENTS LATER \nMike drives off out of the parking lot. To his left he spies- ANGLE ON: Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang. \nMike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart.   Drive's off. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nEd sits at the island, a laptop in front of him. On the screen WE see he's perusing www.spellscursesincantations.com. \nThe sound of the front door opening and closing. Mike enters. \nED Did you find the janitor? \nMIKE He doesn't exist.   Nothing makes sense. \nED Did he ask you for your soul? \nMIKE No? \nMike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras. \nANGLE: Wonder Bra Table. Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren pick around plates of cafeteria food. \nMAGGIE What's the big deal? He stuck up for me in class. It was a nice thing to do. \nSAMANTHA He was totally sexing on you. \nLAUREN He's coming. Pretend you're not here. \nMike approaches, big smile. The Wonder Bras look off in every direction except Mike's. \nMIKE Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls.     I'm Mark- \nThe Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Girls?    Hello? Anyone home? \nLAUREN Oh my God.     Can't you see we're not here? \nMIKE Good.    So there's plenty of room then. \nMike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie. \nJAMIE Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch. How sped. (special ed) \nMike hides his lunch. \nSAMANTHA Look, this table is V.I.P.     You're a NIP. \nMIKE What's a NIP? \nLAUREN Not Important. Go away. \nMIKE Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls? \nMAGGIE Listen, I appreciate what you did in class but, I already have a boyfriend. \nMIKE You have a boyfriend? (his phone rings) Excuse me a second. \nMike pulls out an OLDER Blackberry phone, looks at the caller ID...Scarlet. He sends it to voice mail. \nJAMIE He still gets calls.    How 2007. \nSAMANTHA I think my grandfather has that phone. \nMIKE Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE- \nThe sound of a bouncing ball interrupts. \nMALE VOICE (o.s.) Yo! \nMike turns.   Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over. \nSTAN Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table? \nMAGGIE Nothing.   He was just leaving. \nMaggie nods for Mike to go. \nMIKE (SARCASTIC) We should do this again sometime. \nMike stands. Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with her, hands all over her. WE can see Mike's blood BOIL until- \nMIKE (CONT'D) Get your hands off her, you little punk! \nOops. Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot taller than him. \nSTAN You gotta problem with me, `bra? \nMike looks around...the entire cafeteria watches.   Defeated- \nMIKE No, no, I don't. \nStan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back on Mike's head and SMUSHES it down. \nThe Boys gather a stack of TEEN MAGAZINES and TABLOID RAGS. Ed slips a MELONS Magazine into the pile. \nINT. TRENDY HAIR SALON - NIGHT \nA picture of a YOUNG, POPULAR STAR torn from one of the teen mags hangs on the mirror. \nA HAIRDRESSER cuts away and highlights Mike's long locks.     Ed sits beside Mike sipping wine, enjoying a manicure. \nINT. TRENDY CLOTHES STORE - NIGHT \nIt's the PRETTY WOMAN scene. 2 hip SALESGIRLS pull clothes from racks. A clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, T- shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry. Ed nods with his approval or disapproval. \nAt the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes.     Ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it. The Girls frown and go back to work. \nINT. VIRGIN MEGA MUSIC STORE - NIGHT \nMike and Ed stand before the wall of 100 top albums.   Both wear headphones listening and moving to the music. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT \nMike and Ed, surrounded by the magazines and music discs, sit before the computer. Ed TEACHES Mike how to create a MYSPACE page. \nBogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books. They fill his Friends section with only hot girls. \nThe Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists.   This page makes `Mark Freedman' look like a playboy. \nINT. MAC STORE - NIGHT \nA SALESMAN hands a smiling Mike his new iPhone. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMike sits on the bed, types away on his laptop. A knock on the door. Mike looks up and YELLS. Ed stands in the doorway, his entire body and head wrapped in SEAWEED. \nED Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas. \nMIKE There must be a very hot girl downstairs. \nED There is.    What are you doing? \nMIKE I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it? \nED Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow? \nMIKE I am so ready. \nEd flips Mike a set of keys.     Mike's eyes light up. \nED That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son. \nEd plods off.   Off Mike's huge smile. \nEXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - MORNING \nThe usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang. \nStan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing. \nHONK.   A horn blares.    Stan and Maggie jump out of the way. \nAn ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike. \nMike winks then rolls on past. \nSAMANTHA Oh my god.     Was that- \nJAMIE Did you see- \nLAUREN I told you he was cute. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY \nIt's the MOMENT.   Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip. \nSamantha, Lauren and Jamie text by their lockers.    Mike struts up to them. The Bras smile. \nSCARLET You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here. \nScarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there. (MORE) \nSCARLET (CONT'D) And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here. \nMIKE It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar. \nA chill runs up Scarlet's spine. \nSCARLET My husband's the only one that ever calls me that. \nAlex appears at the doors interrupting- \nALEX Yo, Mark.    Let's do this. \nMIKE Good luck with the project. \nSCARLET Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30. \nMike heads back inside.   Scarlet stares after him. \nINT. ASTON MARTIN - NIGHT \nMike and Alex step in. \nMIKE How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all. \nALEX She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed. I think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while. Whatever. \nBEEP. BEEP. Mike pulls out his iPhone, text message from Samantha. It reads: \nSAMANTHA'S TEXT Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo. sam. \nMike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics. \nMIKE I have no idea what this says? \nAlex takes the phone from Mike, reads- \nALEX It says `What up? Mobbing it to Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be right back. Back. Got to go. Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam. \nMIKE Let's hit the beach, wingman. \nThe two touch fists. \nEXT. ZUMA BEACH - NIGHT \nA BONFIRE illuminates the night sky. MUSIC plays. KIDS lay on blankets, play football. Others splash in the ocean. \nWE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire. \nSAMANTHA We were on his myspace page. There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella. \nJAMIE I heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him. \nLAUREN Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa. \nSAMANTHA Oh my God!     I bet he knows Justin. \nANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand. \nALEX This looks boring. Let's go back to my house and play video games. \nAlex turns.   Mike grabs his arm, turns him back. \nMIKE What are you so nervous about? \nALEX The beach is for the older, cool kids. I don't belong here. \nMIKE What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool. \nALEX I don't play basketball. I mean, I can play, I just don't play on the team. \nNICOLE Oh my God!     Seriously!? \nAlex rips a huge BURP.    The Girls duck for cover. \nGIRL 1 I think he got some on me! \nALEX Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real nervous and I've wanted to talk to you for so long. And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but I couldn't find anything because everything's so...perfect. \nNicole and her Friends MELT. \nNICOLE Do you want to sit down, Nicole? \nNicole scoots over making room next to her.    Alex smiles. \nANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie. \nMAGGIE What do you want? \nMIKE Stan.   Why are you dating him? \nMAGGIE Get to the point why don't you? \nMIKE I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass. \nMAGGIE Don't talk about him like that. You don't even know him. \nMIKE I know he bullies your brother. \nMAGGIE Stan barely knows Alex exists. We're moving in together after graduation. \nMIKE Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown? \nMAGGIE I'm going to Westwood Community College. Stan and I both are. \nMike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting- \nMIKE The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final! \nMaggie jumps up.   Kids all stare. \nMAGGIE Who do you think you are!?   My father?! \nMaggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras. \nMIKE Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell! \nMaggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare.   Maggie heads for the parking lot. \nSAMANTHA Who's Margaret? \nLAUREN He doesn't even know her name. \nJAMIE He's so not into her. \nThe Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie. \nMike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the faces of a group of KIDS. \nEXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - MORNING \nA HOT GIRL wearing a `Lifeguard' bathing suit sits atop a high chair. \nEd floats on a raft. A frozen drink next to him.    Scarlet looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation- \nSCARLET I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care. \nED He cares. \nSCARLET Then where is he? \nMike steps from the house, sees Scarlet- \nMIKE What's going on? \nSCARLET Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off. \nSTAN Stuck!!!   I'm stuck!   My fingers! \nStan stands, hunched...the CHAIR GLUED to his butt. The DESK ATTACHED to his forearm and his FINGERS STUCK to his nose. \nThe Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, PANICKING. \nMR. ADAMS Sit down, Stan! Sit down! \nSTAN It's glue! I'm glued to everything! \nJazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist. \nJAZZ I'll get it off! \nSTAN No!    No!   Don't pull--! \nRRRRIIIIPPPP.    Jazz yanks.   Stan's SCREAM echoes. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY \nMike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball, stands in the middle of the court. Alex enters. \nALEX I got your text.     What's so important? \nMIKE This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half. \nALEX Forget it. \nMIKE Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway. \nMike begins to walk out. \nALEX Hey!     I got skills. \nMike turns back. \nMIKE So what's your problem?      Is it Stan and his friends? \nALEX Just leave it alone. \nMIKE You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex. \nALEX I'm too small anyway. \nMIKE That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are- \nALEX -it's how big you play. (QUIZZICALLY) Where did you hear that? \nMIKE (COVERS) I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got. \nMike tosses Alex the ball. Alex begins to dribble. Mike steps up to defend. Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Alright.   You got a little game. \nWHAM. The doors slam open. In walk Stan and his Posse.     A BLOOD speckled BAND-AID covers the tip of Stan's nose. \nSTAN What are you 2 queers doing in my gym? \nMIKE Let's go, Alex. \nAlex stops dribbling. He and Mike move towards the door. Stan and his Posse block the way. \nSTAN I don't think so. You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play. 2 on 2. \nMIKE We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs. \nStan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles. \nSTAN Come on, Ally. Embarrass me. \nWhile dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's midsection, forcing Alex back. \nMIKE Back off, Stan. \nAlex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid- \nED I haven't heard from him, really. \nScarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit... \nSCARLET Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses- \nED I'll tell him.    I promise. \nScarlet forces a smile. Mike watches her go. For the first time he's seen HER REALITY...hurt, pain, frustration. Mike places his head sadly in his hands. \nJulie the Principal pokes her head out the door. \nJULIE Ed, come on in. \nEd whispers to Mike. \nED I'll take it from here. \nAs Ed passes Julie on the way in- \nED (CONT'D) I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nEd takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled parent' look. \nJULIE Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much. Boys will be boys. But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair. \nEd stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face. \nED My son?     Mark!   Get in here!   Now! \nMike slouches in, takes a seat. \nED (CONT'D) Did you glue a boy to his chair? \nMIKE No. \nEd throws his hands up in exasperation. \nED See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables- \nMIKE                                 ED He shaves his back.                He sucks his thumb. \nMIKE                                ED He wears girls underwear.          He wets his bed. \nJULIE Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to be the new kid but if I have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse. You can go now. \nMike nods, exits.   Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness- \nED He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas? \nJULIE Let's give him time to figure it out on his own. If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step. \nED You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind. \nEd shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY \nA dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down. \nMIKE (o.s.) Got an extra pair of gloves? \nScarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in.    Scarlet stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans. \nSCARLET Gloves are for sissies. \nMIKE Yeah, but I just had a manicure. \nSCARLET (LAUGHS) You're serious? You want to help? \nMIKE Are you kidding? I love landscaping! (MORE) \nMIKE (CONT'D) It's right up there with watching \"Sex and the City\" and snuggling. \nMAGGIE You're so sweet. \nANGLE ON Maggie's face.       She's SMITTEN. \nMONTAGE OF LIFE \nEXT.

MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY \nMike and Scarlet settle the limestone rocks into the freshly laid sod creating a walkway. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY \nMaggie solves a difficult problem on the board, much to Mr. Adam's chagrin. \nMaggie turns from the chalkboard and smiles flirtatiously at Mike. Stan catches this exchange and pops the back of Mike's head. \nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT \nLights shine down. Alex stands behind the 3 point line. Mike feeds him balls. Alex shoots and moves. Shoots and moves. More misses than hits. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nAgain, Mike and Ed sit before a stern Julie. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - DAY \nMike teaches Alex the cross over dribble. Scarlet brings the boys water. Mike checks her out as she goes back in the house. Alex bounces the ball off his head. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY \nA muffled buzz. Mike reaches into his pocket, pulls out his phone. A PIX MESSAGE. Mike opens it. A close up of perfect CLEAVAGE. \nMike peeks over his shoulder...the Wonder Bras text on their phones. He's confused until- \n-Mike turns a little more in his seat...MAGGIE smiles seductively at him, blows a kiss. Mike GASPS, spins back around...TRAUMATIZED. \nEXT.

You don't like Beluga?     You can get something else. \nJULIE I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine. \nED Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo? \nJULIE I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are. \nED I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is. \nJULIE You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet. (MORE) \nJULIE (CONT'D) But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems.

I used to practice on my dad's Playboys. \nMIKE How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS- \nMike places a hand gently on either side of Alex's face. \nCLOSE ON a Heavy Kid leans over the pool PUKING.

It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here? \nMIKE Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his girlfriend. \nSCARLET Alex has a girlfriend? \nMIKE He does and she's really cute. Come on. \nMike leads Scarlet away from the pool. \nINT. FERRARI - NIGHT \nEd and Julie drive through the upscale neighborhood. \nJULIE How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years. \nED I have two words for you.    Russian mafia. \nJULIE Drive faster. \nHe steps on the gas. He fishtails around a corner.

Let me explain- \nALEX How could you do this to me? \nAlex whisks Nicole into the house.   Mike lowers his head.    Ed stomps over, grabs Mike. \nED This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!? \nMIKE She hates me, Ed.    I've ruined everything. \nMike runs for the house.

I don't quite know how to put this. \nJULIE Try being honest. \nED He's not really my son.    I don't have a son. \nSLAP.

Ed sits on the bed. \nED (CONT'D) Are you alright? \nMIKE I really messed up.    I've lost my family. \nED That's not true.      Nothing's ever truly lost. \nMIKE What about you and Julie? \nED Oh, that?    That's lost. \nMIKE Sorry about the party.      I'll pay for any damages. \nED Don't worry about it.

She looks back confused. \nINT. BMW CONVERTIBLE - DAY \nA solemn Mike stares out the window.    Ed turns the radio off. \nED Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment. \nMike looks to Ed. \nMIKE What are you talking about? \nED According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back. That speech should've broken the spell. \nMIKE Enough with the magic crap, Ed. \nED You know what this means? You need to let them go. You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours. \nMike chokes back tears...because he knows Ed is right. \nINT.

His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him because...HE'S 17 AGAIN. \nEd's eyes widen with FEAR. \nMIKE I've had a really rough night. \nED AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!! \nEd slams the door, frantically wobbles away. The door opens, ANGLE ON the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nANGLE ON Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an over-sized loofah. The door slowly swings open. Ed gasps- \nED Don't come any closer!

Really. \nThe Maid hurries off muttering prayers in Spanish. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - LATER \nED My theory is that you were transformed by a freak congruence of some of the planets most volatile elements. I've recreated the exact contents of the LA River.

Both smiling. \nJULIE (CONT'D) So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut. And you were a straight A student. Very impressive. \nED I help him with his homework...a lot. \nMIKE Oh, dad, the doctor called.     You were right. It is herpes. \nEd's jaw drops.

Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name? \nLaughter from the Students. \nSTAN You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are? \nMAGGIE Cut it out, Stan.    Let's eat. \nSTAN Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch. \nMike ignores him and starts dribbling. \nMIKE You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you. \nSTAN You don't know me. \nMike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria. \nMIKE Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom. \nStan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs. \nMIKE (CONT'D) But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason- \nMike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3. \nThe entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. \nMike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then gently rolls the ball back to Stan. \nMIKE (CONT'D) (WINKS) Don't hurt yourself big boy. \nSome students, including Alex, ERUPT. The Wonder Bras eye Mike with new found lust. \nANGLE ON Mike's face as he walks away. \nMIKE (CONT'D) (to himself) \nMike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across the cafeteria landing on Miss Goodwin's tray, splattering her with food. She glares at Stan. \nMike's iphone buzzes...ANGLE ON SCREEN: the Wonder Bras digits appear. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE CENTER - DAY \nMike enters, approaches MRS. MENCER, 60. \nMIKE My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college. \nMRS. MENCER A lot of kids feel that way. Don't be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to take a look. \nMrs. Mencer hands Mike a hefty book. \nMRS. MENCER (CONT'D) A good place to start is here... this book has information on every college and university in the country. \nMIKE Thanks. \nMike sits, starts paging through the book and gets lost in the bright colored pictures...smiling STUDENTS, CAMPUSES and LECTURE HALLS...THE OPTIONS HE LOST YEARS AGO. \n", "test3_true": "A pumped-up Mike dials...ringing. On the seat beside him rests a stack of college applications. Ed answers. \nED (o.s.) Hello? \nMIKE It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers! \nED See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office? \nMIKE Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy. \nMike hangs up. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell. \nSCARLET (o.s.) Coming! \nThe door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...(gasps) \nScarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance... \nMIKE Is something wrong? \nSCARLET (FLUSTERED) No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nScarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares at Mike as if examining every pore on his face. \nSCARLET And you say Ed Freedman is your father? \nMIKE That's my dad. All 68 inches of him. \nSCARLET You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother? \nMIKE My mother...she...she was...a... \nMike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table. \nMIKE (CONT'D) -a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now. \nSCARLET Oh?   I'm sorry. \nMIKE I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe? \nSCARLET Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that? \nMIKE I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town. \nSCARLET I'll keep that in mind, Mark. \nScarlet can't take her eyes off Mike. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager. \nMike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes- \nMIKE You doing some gardening? \nSCARLET I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you. \nScarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some. \nScarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers, trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT \nMike and Scarlet step outside. \nMIKE I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it. \n", "test3_id": 59}

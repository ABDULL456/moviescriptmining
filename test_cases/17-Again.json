{"test1_input": "JAMIE Rad phone. \nMIKE I know. I'll text you...NOT. Later...much. \nMike rises from the table. \nSAMANTHA Like we'd ever give you our numbers. \nStan, carrying a basketball, his goons and Maggie come up behind Mike. \nSTAN Heads up! \nStan whips the ball at Mike. Mike, cat-quick, spins around, catches the ball. \nThe whole cafeteria turns their attention on Mike and Stan. Mike points to the name `Stan' on Stan's letter jacket, reads- \nMIKE Stan. Did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name? \nLaughter from the Students. \nSTAN You think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are? \nMAGGIE Cut it out, Stan.    Let's eat. \nSTAN Gimme my ball back, bee-yotch. \nMike ignores him and starts dribbling. \nMIKE You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you. \nSTAN You don't know me. \nMike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria. \nMIKE Oh but I do. All too well. You're the man. Captain of the basketball team. Dates the pretty girls. High school is your kingdom. \nStan and his Posse tap fists. Mike dribbles between his legs. \nMIKE (CONT'D) But, People, Stan's a bully. Why? It would be way too easy to say Stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. No, Stan's more complex than that. According to leading psychiatrists Stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, Stan's brain is underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is unable to use self-control so he acts out aggressively. And the third reason- \nMike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I'd argue that Stan suffers from all 3. \nThe entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY. \nMike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then gently rolls the ball back to Stan. \nMIKE (CONT'D) (WINKS) Don't hurt yourself big boy. \nSome students, including Alex, ERUPT. The Wonder Bras eye Mike with new found lust. \nANGLE ON Mike's face as he walks away. \nMIKE (CONT'D) (to himself) \nMike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across the cafeteria landing on Miss Goodwin's tray, splattering her with food. She glares at Stan. \nMike's iphone buzzes...ANGLE ON SCREEN: the Wonder Bras digits appear. \nINT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE CENTER - DAY \nMike enters, approaches MRS. MENCER, 60. \nMIKE My guidance councilor made me come, but just so you know I'm not planning on going to college. \nMRS. MENCER A lot of kids feel that way. Don't be intimidated. It doesn't hurt to take a look. \nMrs. Mencer hands Mike a hefty book. \nMRS. MENCER (CONT'D) A good place to start is here... this book has information on every college and university in the country. \nMIKE Thanks. \nMike sits, starts paging through the book and gets lost in the bright colored pictures...smiling STUDENTS, CAMPUSES and LECTURE HALLS...THE OPTIONS HE LOST YEARS AGO. \n", "test1_true": "A pumped-up Mike dials...ringing. On the seat beside him rests a stack of college applications. Ed answers. \nED (o.s.) Hello? \nMIKE It was incredible! I was incredible! You should'a seen me! I humiliated Stan in front of the entire lunchroom. Everyone was clapping. The popular girls were begging to give me their numbers! \nED See what happens when you put a little lipstick on the pig? Did you manage to get sent to the principal's office? \nMIKE Man, I feel great! I even shot some hoops after school. No aches. No pains. Gotta run, Buddy. \nMike hangs up. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Aston Martin pulls up. Mike climbs out, walks to the door, takes a deep breath and rings the bell. \nSCARLET (o.s.) Coming! \nThe door opens revealing Scarlet in her dirty yard attire. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) I've been dying to meet you. I've known your father since...(gasps) \nScarlet...SPEECHLESS...visibly stunned by the resemblance... \nMIKE Is something wrong? \nSCARLET (FLUSTERED) No. It's just...you look like...No. I'm fine. Come in. Please. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nScarlet and Mike sit across from one another. Scarlet stares at Mike as if examining every pore on his face. \nSCARLET And you say Ed Freedman is your father? \nMIKE That's my dad. All 68 inches of him. \nSCARLET You don't look anything like him. If you don't mind me asking, who's your mother? \nMIKE My mother...she...she was...a... \nMike spies Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment on a table. \nMIKE (CONT'D) -a convict. In New Jersey. They met while dad was at Princeton. She was on parole. B&E, fist fighting, shanking. Nothing major. But she's dead now. \nSCARLET Oh?   I'm sorry. \nMIKE I warned her about kite surfing during hurricane season. So how are things with you? Doing anything exciting? Dating? Flirting with Dom Johnson maybe? \nSCARLET Why would you ask about Dom? Did Ed tell you to say that? \nMIKE I mean do what you want. You're a grown woman but, word on the street is Dom's been spreading gingivitis all over town. \nSCARLET I'll keep that in mind, Mark. \nScarlet can't take her eyes off Mike. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's crazy how much you like my husband when he was a teenager. \nMike switches subjects, points to her dirty clothes- \nMIKE You doing some gardening? \nSCARLET I am. I'm a landscape designer. I'm actually redoing the backyard. I'll show you. \nScarlet stands, leads Mike to the french doors. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) It's a work in progress so you'll have to use your imagination some. \nScarlet opens the doors, flips on the lights. The yard's been cleaned up. Fresh blankets of sod rest in piles next to stacks of limestone. HUNDREDS of unplanted plants, flowers, trees and shrubs sit around the yard in strategic positions. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT \nMike and Scarlet step outside. \nMIKE I almost don't even recognize it...er...if I had seen it before I probably wouldn't recognize it. \n", "test1_id": 57, "test2_input": "Maggie stops, looks quizzically at Mike- \nMAGGIE What are you trying to say?    Are you...\"confused\"? \nMIKE Yes! Yes! That's it. I'm confused. Extremely confused. \nMAGGIE Ohmygod! It all makes sense now! Your hair. The highlights. \nMike starts to speak.   Stops.   Finally gets it- \nMIKE What? No-no-no-no. I'm not gay. I'm...I've been in love with the same girl since I was 17. \nMaggie switches back into predatory mode. \nMAGGIE Who is it? Does she go to our school? Do I know her? \nMIKE No, you don't. Now- (eyes the toilet) -if you don't mind? \nMAGGIE Tell your girlfriend she better keep a close eye on you. \nMaggie smiles seductively and struts out. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nAlex types on his phone.   Mike enters. \nMIKE Who you texting? \nALEX My dad.   I have to tell him about today. \nMike nods...then realizes...BEEP...BEEP. HIS PHONE.     Alex and Maggie look to Mike. Mike checks his phone. \nALEX (CONT'D) Did you just get a text? \nMIKE (NERVOUS) Me? No. Yes. It's Ed. I mean dad. Not your dad. My dad. I'll just call him back. \nScarlet enters. She looks AMAZING. \nSCARLET So?   What happened? Tell me.     Tell me.   I'm dying to hear. \nALEX I did it. I'm a Falcon!     The first game's in 2 weeks. \nSCARLET Oh my God, Alex! That's so incredible! \nScarlet wraps Alex in a big hug.    Mike watches.   It's a bittersweet moment for him. \nSCARLET (CONT'D) I'm so happy for you. And now I want to show you guys something. \nScarlet, unable to contain her excitement, leads Mike and Alex to the french doors and flicks a light switch... \nSCARLET (CONT'D) Ta da! \nThousands of tiny, white lights illuminate Scarlet's OASIS... \nMIKE You hung the lights! \nSCARLET I wanted you to be the first to see it. \nALEX Mom, it's sick. \nEXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT \nThe 3 step outside.   Mike, truly blown away, takes picture with his iPhone. \nMIKE It's amazing. I'm speechless. I'm sorry I never saw how talented you are...I mean when people see this and how talented you are you'll be designing sanctuaries all over the city. \nSCARLET (BEAMS) Thank you. \nALEX Mom, why are you all dressed up? \nSCARLET Oh my God. I almost forgot.    I have a date. \nOff Mike's stunned reaction. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "Mike marches in behind Scarlet.   As they reach the door, he steps in front of her. \nMIKE Let's see who the lucky guy is. \nMike swings the door open revealing...Dom Johnson. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I knew it! \nSLAM.   Mike shuts the door, blocks it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I knew you had a thing for him! You can't do this! You took vows. What kind of example are you setting for the kids!? \nSCARLET Mark, I'm flattered. Really, I am. But I'm too old for you. \nScarlet moves Mike aside, opens the door.     Dom stands in the doorway holding a bouquet. \nDOM Wow. You look absolutely ravishing. \nMIKE Keep it in your pants, Casanova. \nSCARLET Don't mind him. You all set? \nDOM Let's do it. \nScarlet heads for the van.     Dom looks to Mike- \nDOM (CONT'D) Hey, kid...if the vans'a rockin'...well you know the rest. \nDom imitates humping, jogs after Scarlet. \nMIKE Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live! \nMike slams the door. \nINT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nA contemplative Alex scoops lasagna onto plates.    An agitated Mike enters, pulls up a seat at the counter. \nALEX It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad. \nMIKE It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats.   You need to talk to her. \nALEX My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is...wherever he is. \nMIKE Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be. \nALEX No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a game. \nMIKE Then why would you tell him that? \nALEX I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more. \nMike is CRUSHED. \nINT. GUCCI STORE - DAY \nMike paces in front of a dressing room.   A SALESMAN waits by the door. \nMIKE My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed. \nEd steps from the changing room wearing very tight, ultra hip clothes that belong on a 20 year old...he looks ridiculous. \nED What about college? \nMIKE I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family back. (BEAT) You're not gonna wear that, are you? \nEd checks his butt in a full length mirror, nods happily. \nED Baby's got back. \nEd retreats into the changing room. \nED (CONT'D) (o.s.) Now that Julie's agreed to go out with me tonight, I need you to start behaving. I can't have her thinking my son is a complete degenerate. \nMIKE Fine. I want to have some kids over tonight to celebrate Alex making the team. Is that cool? \n", "test2_id": 58, "test3_input": "Ed, wearing only his banana hammock underwear and socks, steps from the room, hands the clothes to the Salesman. \nED Wrap it up. No, it's not cool. I remember hearing what those parties were like, kids peeing everywhere, food on the ceilings, puke in the pool. \nMIKE Listen to you. You sound like an old man. \nOther SHOPPERS eye Ed oddly as they pass. \nED No party. I mean it.    Don't make me take the car away. \nMIKE Don't treat me like a child, Ed. \nED I won't when you stop acting like one. \nMike grabs Ed's bare tits and TWISTS. Ed screams, grabs Mike's tits and TWISTS. Both of them HOWL in pain. \nSALESMAN Sir!   Please! \nMike and Ed, both still titty twisting, look up. Everyone in the store stares. They each let go, force smiles. \nED This isn't over...son! \nMIKE Not even close...Dad! \nEd stomps into the dressing room rubbing his sore boobs. Mike pulls out his iPhone, begins texting. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Get the word out. \nThe Bras type away, simultaneously hit SEND. WIDE REVEALS...hundreds of students...the beeps of hundreds of cell phones. \nEXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCARS line the street. A steady flow of KIDS stream towards the front door. MUSIC pounds from within. It's a RAGER. \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMAYHEM. Kids raid the refrigerator, throw food around. Another KID sprays the room with the removable sink head. \nMike rushes in, grabs the sink head from the Kid. \nMIKE Give me that! \nWONDER BRAS (O.S.) Hey, Sexy. \nMike turns without thinking SPRAYING all 3 Wonder Bras in the face. The Bras scream. Mike replaces the nozzle. \nMIKE I'm so sorry. Have you seen Alex? \nThe Bras wipe themselves off, grab Mike's hands. \nSAMANTHA Dance with us! \nThe Bras drag a reluctant Mike out of the kitchen and into - \nINT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nPARTY-GOERS dance everywhere and on top of everything. \nThe Bras surround Mike, each girl grinding on him as if it were a competition. \nLauren takes Mike by the face, turns him towards her- \nLAUREN Nambib-bib-ib, that African country makes me horny. \nJamie spins Mike towards her, places his hands on her boobs- \nJAMIE Perfect, aren't they? \nSamantha pulls Mike roughly by the hair, twists him around- \n", "test3_true": "Mike tries to squeeze out. The Bras block him. The music changes...a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This' blares. \nMIKE I thought you girls wanted to dance? \nMike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine WE saw from the first scene. \nThe Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in. \nAnd then, the Bras fall in.      Followed by others.   The party just got hotter. \nMaggie runs through the party and out the back. Stan chases after her. Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside. \nEXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - NIGHT \nStan corners Maggie against the back wall. \nSTAN I was upset. I'm sorry. But I need you to show me you love me. Then we'll move in together. \nMAGGIE Whatever.    I'm with someone else now. \nSTAN Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough? \nMAGGIE Him. \nStan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches. \nMIKE Party's over, Stan.      You're out of here. \nSTAN Who's gonna make me leave?      You? \nMIKE I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it. \nMike pulls out his phone.      Stan looks to Maggie then back to Mike, laughs- \nSTAN You can have the nun.      She doesn't put out anyway. \nMIKE On second thought- \nMike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW. Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK. \nINT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT/DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe HOSTESS shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window. Ed wears his new Gucci outfit. Julie's under dressed. \nHOSTESS There you are, Mr. Freedman. \nED Thanks. Put this towards your studies. \nEd hands the Hostess a 50.   Julie rolls her eyes. \nJULIE When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed. \nED Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am? \nJULIE As long as we're on the same page. \nA WAITER approaches. \nWAITER Good evening. Would you care to see the wine- \nED Bring us the 1962 Petrus. \nThe Waiter nods, leaves. \nED (CONT'D) You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle. \nJULIE I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark? \nED It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay? \nJULIE You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you? \nED Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce. \nJulie throws her napkin on the table. \n", "test3_id": 59}

{"test1_input": "CORALINE \nWritten by \nHenry Selick \nBased on the novel by \nNeil Gaiman \nHEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT, \nA HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES. \nThe doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old- fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids - is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button- eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK. \nSawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a button drawer. \nThe transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and \nBACK INTO THE NIGHT. \nLAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES. \nEXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY \nWIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads \"Pink Palace, Apartment for Rent\". \nMR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man - performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in Russian. \nMR. BOBINSKY Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri ... \nA BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE - suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts: \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Mer-sa-vich! \nHe marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in the truck, speaks to his companion. \nMOVER 2 (O.C.) We're here. Time to muscle up. \nANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE. \nThey haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA. \nNEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK, a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate below about the young, strapping men. \nMOVER 2 (CONT'D) \n(EFFORTS) Got it? Almost there, just a few more. Come on, now, LIFT. \nANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and the door is shut. \nEXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME \nANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern. OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH to investigate. \nCORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a skeptical face. \nNEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and moves diagonally away from the house. \nNEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN. \nANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH. She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden. \nCAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three- eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy and follows the girl. \nMONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME \nAFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME \nCoraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell into her shoulder bag. \nANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look. Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up into the air. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER \nSPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the rotted wood, stopping her. \nWE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head our way. \nNEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out. \nCORALINE Hello?...   Who's there? \nShe throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked out, she GASPS, runs up the trail. \nNEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat hops onto the stone wall. \nEXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT. \nCoraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow. \nNEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a harvest cart. \n", "test1_true": "NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall grass. She can't see him but she knows something is there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW! \nSTARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat. \nCORALINE You scared me to death, you mangy thing! \nCat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl as she stands. She exhales. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I'm just looking for an old well. Know it? \nCat BLINKS EYES slowly. \nCORALINE(CONT'D) Not talking, huh? \nThe wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick, closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her, \nSAYS: \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me... the well! \nANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN. STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around. \nUP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS, Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret- lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER! \nCORALINE (CONT'D) (freaked out) \nAHHHHH! \nHe REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to WHACK HIM with her forked stick. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \nGET AWAY FROM ME-- \nHe SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground, THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE- EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien. \nAnd then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume. \nShoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims it around. \nWYBIE \n(OBLIVIOUS) Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or Utah; someplace dried out and barren, right? I heard about water-witching before but it doesn't make sense; I mean, it's just an ordinary branch. \nCoraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS. \nCORALINE \n(ENRAGED) \nIT'S A DOWSING ROD! \nCoraline smacks Wybie. \nWYBIE Ow! \nCORALINE And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by \nPSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS! \nHe crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears. \nWYBIE He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral \u00ad you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things. \nThe cat PURRS like a diesel. \nCORALINE \n(TOUGH) Look, I'm from Pontiac. \nWYBIE Huh? \nCORALINE MICHIGAN? And if I'm a \"water witch\", \nTHEN-- (points stick, stomps foot) --where's the secret WELL? \nWYBIE You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it! \nCoraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the covering. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day. \nCORALINE \n(SOFTENS) Huh. \nHer frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head, noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and the well cover thumps in place. \nWYBIE Surprised she let you move in... \nJerks his head toward the pink house in distance. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) ... my Gramma. She owns the \"Pink Palace\" (indicates house in distance) Won't rent to people with kids. \nCORALINE What do you mean? \n", "test1_id": 2226, "test2_input": "(SKEPTICAL) The Other Mother hates cats? \nCAT \n(CONTEMPTUOUS) Not like any \"mother\" I've ever known. \nCORALINE What do you mean? She's amazing! \nCat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof. \nCAT You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so. \nCORALINE That's nonsense. He can't talk. \nThe cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence. \nCAT Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and -- \nSuddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes, sensing something. \nCAT (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERING) Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over... \nHe SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the corner. \nCoraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS. \nINT. MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S OTHER APARTMENT - SAME \nShe pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a high WOODEN STAGE. \nA FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs, then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie. She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly. \nCORALINE Hey, Wybie. \nLight flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \n(SHOCKED) She's practically naked! \nAnd Miss Spink sings. \nOTHER MISS SPINK I'm known as the siren of all seven seas The breaker of hearts by the bay. \nA flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind her. \nOTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D) So, if you go swimmin' With bow-legged women, I might steal your weak heart away. \nShe bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their tails. \nSpink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum - her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing the wrong way. \nCORALINE (whisper, to Wybie) Oh my God. \nA dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to the audience and begins the next verse. \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves, And hope to lead sailors astray, But a true ocean goddess, Must fill out her bodice, (indicates her ample bosom) To present an alluring display. \nThe dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap. \nSpink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's dissing. \nOTHER MISS SPINK Beware of old oysters, too large in the chest, Let's banish them from the buffet. \nBut Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and down, competing. \nOTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D) I'm far more nutritious \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE You smell like the fishes \nOTHER MISS SPINK Did I hear a banshee? \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE You're sea-green with envy \nOTHER MISS SPINK This mermaid enchantress, \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE No, I \"Birth of Venus!\" \nThe set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap, sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall. \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE \n(CONT'D) Will send sailors swooning --oh--! \nOTHER MISS SPINK Will send sailors swooning --oh--! \nWith a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE. Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the curtains close on the disaster. \nDRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER, labeled \"POOL\", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it. \nCORALINE \n(WHISPERS) I can't look! \n", "test2_true": "OTHER MISS FORCIBLE Our lives for the theater, April! \nThey begin to bounce on the diving boards. As they bounce up, the two troupers unzip FAT SUIT DISGUISES from which emerge their YOUNGER BEAUTIFUL SELVES which LEAP to catch matching TRAPEZE BARS that swing into place. \nCoraline LAUGHS with relief and amazement, Other Wybie pleased. Dogs WOOF, MUSIC BEGINS and the TWO BEAUTIES \u00ad eyes BRIGHT BUTTONS, SEXY BATHING SUITS striped pink and green \u00ad SWING OUT over the stage. \nYOUNG FORCIBLE What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! \nThey FLY past each other on their trapezes, double up, catch one another hand to ankle. We notice a LARGE PEARL RING on Forcible's finger. \nYOUNG SPINK How infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! \nIn a SUDDEN change of direction, they SWING OUT over the audience, trapeze bar LOWERING and PULL CORALINE INTO THE AIR! She HOLLERS, terrified. \nThey expertly TOSS HER one to the other, FLIPPING AND SPINNING, as they continue their lines. Her SCREAMS become CRIES OF EXHILARATION. \nYOUNG FORCIBLE In action like an angel! \nYOUNG SPINK In apprehension how like a god! \nCORALINE Ahhh!!! \nYOUNG FORCIBLE The beauty of the world! \nYOUNG SPINK The paragon of animals! \nCoraline swings face-to-face to the dogs in the royal box seats where one licks her. \nCORALINE Yeah!! \nThe acrobats TOSS CORALINE UP into the air and JACK-KNIFE DIVE into the large bucket below. They rise up, unhurt, just in time to catch Coraline. The THREE BOW to THUNDEROUS THUMPING APPLAUSE and, as the camera pulls back on the scene, Other Wybie throws her a rose! \nEXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - NIGHT \nOther Wybie escorts Coraline up the stone stairs from Spink and Forcible's apartment. The Other Mother and Other Father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait at the top of the stairs. \nOTHER FATHER Hey there. \nOTHER MOTHER Was it wonderful, dear? \nOther Mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and Other Father dapper. Coraline shakes with excitement as they walk toward the front porch. Other Wybie holds back, loses his smile. \nCORALINE Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat \u00ad Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic. \nThey walk up the front steps. \nOTHER MOTHER You do like it here, don't you, Coraline? \nCORALINE (nods, turns back) Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie. \nOther Father takes Coraline inside. Wybie, at the bottom of the steps, looks GUILTY AND SAD. Other Mother glares at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. He just lowers his head. \nINT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nOTHER MOTHER You could stay here forever... if you want to. \nCORALINE Really? \nOTHER FATHER Sure...we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals. \nOther Mother rests her hand on Coraline's shoulder. \nOTHER MOTHER There's one tiny little thing we need to do. \nCORALINE What's that? \nOTHER FATHER Well, it's a surprise. \nINT. OTHER DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline is seated in her place. The Other Mother places a SMALL BOX with a bow in front of her, and takes her seat along with Other Father. Coraline excitedly removes the lid. \nOTHER MOTHER For you ... our little doll. \nThe \"surprise\" is a spool of BLACK THREAD, a SILVER NEEDLE, and a pair of SHINY BLACK BUTTONS -- FOR \nCORALINE'S EYES. \nCoraline GASPS. She looks up at her Other Parents, hoping it's a bad joke. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) \n(SMILING) Black is traditional, but if you'd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse... \nCoraline sees their button eyes changing colors, growing ever more panicked. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) ... though you might make me jealous. \nCORALINE \nNO WAY! \nShe bats the box away, and her hands FLY to her face, COVER her eyes. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \n", "test2_id": 2227, "test3_input": "She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster, says: \nCORALINE I already know where you've hidden them. \nThe Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and sceptical. \nBELDAM Well... produce them. \nCoraline points to the little door. \nCORALINE They're behind that door. \nThe Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly. \nBELDAM Oh, they are, are they? \nA smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline. \nCoraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from?! \nThe cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline -- \nCAT There! \n-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE - \nOPAQUE WITH FROST. \nC.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back from them. \nCORALINE \n(WHISPERING) Mom.   Dad! \nON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns to Coraline, expectantly. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. \nThe Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns it, leaves the key in place. \nShe grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice. \nBELDAM You're wrong, Coraline! \nShe opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel. \nON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat - obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's thinking very hard. \nBELDAM (CONT'D) \n(PITYING) They aren't there. \nShe opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the Beldam softly gloats: \nBELDAM (CONT'D) Now you're going to stay here forever. \nCoraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can. \nCORALINE No ... I'm ... \nShe GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER \nHEAD. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \nNOT! \nAnd she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL - face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD. \nFREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little door. \nCoraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side. \nThe Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO \nSHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES! \nANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug. \nON BELDAM, hands covering her face. \nBELDAM \nNOOOOOOOOO! \nHer hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN \nTHREAD! \nBELDAM (CONT'D) You horrible cheating girl! \nShe furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center. A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR! \nThe web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT. There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS. \n", "test3_true": "Coraline falls the very bottom of the web. \nFifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS DOWN like a huge, flying spider! \nCoraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS. \nThe witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around, grasping blindly. \nBELDAM (CONT'D) Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!! \nCoraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room. She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB \nTO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM. \nBELDAM (CONT'D) Hahahaha... \nThe Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now! \nCoraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS \nCOMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST! \nBELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) \nYOU ... DARE ... \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the \nBELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE. \nBELDAM \n... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!! \nCoraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The cat takes off down the tunnel. \nCoraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN! \nCORALINE \nPLEASE...SHUT!! \nThe ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED. \nThe door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the ground! \nShe SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement! \nCoraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can. \nThe pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing. \nBELDAM (O.S.) \nDON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL \nDIE WITHOUT YOU!!!! \nAnd then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side \nSTARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER! \nAhead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE \nREAL WORLD! \nINT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split- second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door and lock, hold. It's over... \nCoraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds. \nShe smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside. \nShe opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE! \nShe gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE. She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside. \nAs the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY REAL MOTHER calls to her. \nMEL (O.S.) Coraline? We're home! \nHer TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair. \nCORALINE Mom! Dad! I missed you so much! \nCoraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around them. \nMEL Missed us? \nC.U. ON CORALINE. Huh? \nMel notices the broken snow globe. \n", "test3_id": 2228}

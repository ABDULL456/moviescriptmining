{"train": "CORALINE \nWritten by \nHenry Selick \nBased on the novel by \nNeil Gaiman \nHEAD CREDIT SEQUENCE MYSTERIOUS SEWING ROOM - NIGHT, \nA HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES. \nThe doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old- fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids - is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button- eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK. \nSawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a button drawer. \nThe transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and \nBACK INTO THE NIGHT. \nLAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES. \nEXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY \nWIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads \"Pink Palace, Apartment for Rent\". \nMR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man - performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in Russian. \nMR. BOBINSKY Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri ... \nA BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE - suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts: \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Mer-sa-vich! \nHe marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in the truck, speaks to his companion. \nMOVER 2 (O.C.) We're here. Time to muscle up. \nANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE. \nThey haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA. \nNEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK, a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate below about the young, strapping men. \nMOVER 2 (CONT'D) \n(EFFORTS) Got it? Almost there, just a few more. Come on, now, LIFT. \nANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and the door is shut. \nEXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME \nANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern. OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH to investigate. \nCORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a skeptical face. \nNEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and moves diagonally away from the house. \nNEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN. \nANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH. She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden. \nCAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three- eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy and follows the girl. \nMONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME \nAFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME \nCoraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell into her shoulder bag. \nANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look. Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up into the air. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER \nSPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the rotted wood, stopping her. \nWE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head our way. \nNEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out. \nCORALINE Hello?...   Who's there? \nShe throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked out, she GASPS, runs up the trail. \nNEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat hops onto the stone wall. \nEXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT. \nCoraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow. \nNEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a harvest cart. \nWYBIE (suddenly worried) Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it. \nChanging the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat. \nCORALINE \n(SKEPTICAL) Wybie? \nWYBIE Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with? \nCORALINE I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline. \nWYBIE Caroline what? \nCORALINE Coraline. Coraline Jones. \nWYBIE (confused, not hearing it) Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline -- \nHer face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) -- can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person-- \nWYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) (calling from afar) Wyborne! \nCORALINE I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne. \nWYBIE What? I didn't hear anything-- \nCORALINE Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born. \nA distant dinner bell clangs. \nWYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! \nWYBIE (under his breath, nervous) Grandma! \nHe holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes closed, forcing some laughs. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch. \nHe picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his gloved hands. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) But I'd wear gloves next time. \nCORALINE \n(SKEPTICAL) Why? \nHe points to her dowsing rod, nods. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it's poison oak. \nCORALINE Ehh!! \nCoraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her hands on her clothes. \nThe cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER TONGUE at him. \nShe looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE. Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery \"plop\" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her. \nROTATE DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING \nIt's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD- LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins, squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill. She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one hand. \nThe main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded. Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE. \nCORALINE I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom. \nMEL (not listening) Uh huh. \nCORALINE I would have died. \nMEL (continues typing) That's nice. \nCoraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject. \nCORALINE Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening. \nMEL No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess. \nCoraline turns to her. \nCORALINE But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here? \nMEL Something like that. But then we had the accident. \nCORALINE Wasn't my fault you hit that truck. \nMEL I never said it was. \nCORALINE \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Ahh!! \nShe shakes out her hair. \nHALLWAY NEAR STAIRS \nCoraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate. \nWATER HEATER CLOSET \nANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it that says: Do not turn off! \nINT. STUDY - SAME \nLights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He hollers. \nCHARLIE No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--! \nINT. HALLWAY - SAME \nCHARLIE (O.S.) \n--AAAAAAA! \nCoraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the closet and -- \nINT. CLOSET - SAME \n-- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light switch back on and gets out of there. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nThe room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall. \nCoraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles. \nThe box is filled with her mom's collection of SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it. \nOver the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE - a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud. \nCORALINE One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors... \nShe turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow globe box. It's gone. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) All right, little me, where are you hiding? \nScanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall. Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the box. \nShe shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Huh? \nIntensely curious, she calls to the kitchen. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Hey Mom... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMom, typing away, ignores her. \nCORALINE (O.S.) Where does this door go? \nMEL I'm really, really busy! \nINT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline tries to open it but there's no handle. \nCORALINE I think it's locked. \nMEL (O.S.) \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nCORALINE (O.S.) Pleeeeeeeeease! \nMel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh. \nMEL Uhhh... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nShe walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the door in the ratty old wallpaper. \nMEL Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you? \nCoraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog. \nMEL (CONT'D) Fine. \nShe heads back to the kitchen. \nINT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nMel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key. Holds it up. \nCORALINE No!!! \nBobinsky LEAPS all the way to the ground, landing beside her, out of breath. \nMR. BOBINSKY The mice...asked me to give you message. \nCORALINE The...jumping mice? \nMr. B nods gravely. He leans down, so close his moustache touches her ear, and whispers, his voice DEAD-SERIOUS. \nMR. BOBINSKY They are saying: do not go through leetle door. Do you know such a thing? \nCoraline is startled. \nCORALINE The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up. \nThe old man shrugs, straightens. \nMR. BOBINSKY Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes the mice are leetle... \nHe points to his head and rotates his finger. \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) ...mixed up, hmmm? They even get your name wrong, you know. They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not Caroline at all. \nHe starts back up the stairs. \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Maybe I work them too hard... \nCoraline stares after him. \nEXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nSHEARS IN HAND, Coraline approaches the family VW, where one PINK SUITCASE remains tied to the roof. She snips it free and takes out her special HAT, a black Japanese schoolboy's cap. \nEXT. HOUSE, STAIRWELL DOWNSTAIRS FLAT \u00ad SAME \nCoraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat. At the door, she tries the comedy/tragedy door knocker and waits. Nothing. She glances down at the doormat - it reads \"No whistling in the house.\" \nShe peers through the door glass. A YAPPING DOG suddenly LEAPS UP inside, startling her, and a moment after, MISS SPINK \u00ad wearing some sort of house robe \u00ad opens the door and three SCOTTIE DOGS \u00ad HAMISH, JOCK, AND ANGUS \u00ad shoot out and surround Coraline. Spink tries to quiet them down. \nMISS SPINK \n(HARSH) Oh cease your infernal yapping! (to Coraline, sweetly) How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you like to come in? We're playing cards. \nCORALINE Still Coraline, Miss Spink. \nMISS SPINK (over shoulder) Miriam, put the kettle on! \nINT. MISSES SPINK & FORCIBLE'S FLAT - SAME \nMiss Spink leads Coraline into the living area, as MISS FORCIBLE, taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very large bosom, prepares tea in the kitchen to the side. The dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa. Coraline scans the walls to see framed POSTERS from the \"Shakespeare\" the ladies used to perform like King Leer and Julius Seize Her. Miss Forcible peers out her, half-blind without her glasses. \nMISS FORCIBLE April, I think you're being followed. \nMISS SPINK It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea. \nMISS FORCIBLE No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine. \nMISS SPINK No, Oolong. \nMISS FORCIBLE Ah, Jasmine it is, then. \nForcible grabs a handful of tea, puts it in the pot and pours boiling water in. \nMISS SPINK Come on, boys! \nThe dogs leap off the sofa and, as Coraline takes their place, she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase filled with STUFFED SCOTTY DOGS IN KNITTED SWEATERS WITH \nANGEL WINGS. \nCORALINE \n(ALARMED) Are those dogs .... real? \nMISS SPINK \n(SIGHS) Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn't bear to part with them ... so we had them stuffed. \n(CONTINUES) \n(MORE) \nMISS SPINK (CONT'D) Now, there's Hamish the third, the fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the second, the fifth, the.. \nMiss Forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges Coraline to take a candy as Spink goes on and on. \nMISS FORCIBLE Oh go on, have one \u00ad it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton \u00ad best in the world. \nCoraline reaches for a pink and green one. But the taffy is so old and sticky, her fingers get stuck. Then her other hand gets stuck, trying to get the first hand out. \nMISS SPINK (O.C.) ...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth... \nCoraline, using her feet, finally un-sticks the candy bowl which FLIES UP and sticks to the ceiling. \nMISS SPINK (CONT'D) ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin, twice removed. \nCORALINE What d'ya mean, \"we?\" \nThere's a soft meowing from under his coat. He opens it up and the BLACK CAT EMERGES and climbs onto his shoulders. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Ha! Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! \nCat glares at her angrily. \nWYBIE What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez. \nCORALINE \n(MOCKING) Wuss-puss... \nTired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house. Coraline softens. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) So... that doll. Did you make it look like me? \nWybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks his head up for a moment. \nWYBIE Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly. \nCoraline is highly skeptical. Wybie returns to his hunt. \nCORALINE (points to self) C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat? \nWybie stands excitedly and presents a HUGE YELLOW-GREEN SLUG to Coraline. \nWYBIE Dang, check out Slugzilla! \nShe's not impressed. \nCORALINE \n(FRUSTRATED) You're just like them. \nWYBIE Huh? \nHe looks from the slug to himself. \nCORALINE I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either. \nWybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera -- \nWYBIE Uh huh... You mind? \n-- hands it to her. She acts put-out, but frames a shot. He signals he's ready and she fires off one auto-flash shot after another as he strikes silly poses making SOUND EFFECTS: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in another. She can't help but GIGGLE. \nCORALINE Ew! \nFinished, Wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and takes the camera back. He lowers his head, thoughtful, then glances up past Coraline at the house. He SIGHS and speaks in a SAD TONE. \nWYBIE You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace. \nCORALINE \n(SCEPTICAL) You're kidding. \nWYBIE Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something. \nCORALINE Dangerous? \nWYBIE Well... she had a twin sister. \nCORALINE So? \nWYBIE (O.C.). When they were kids, Grandma's sister disappeared. \n(ON CAMERA) She says she was stolen. \nCORALINE (O.S.) \n(SKEPTICAL) Stolen? \nANGLE from roof, over CAT'S SHOULDER as dialog continues. Cat senses something and turns -- it's Coraline's DOLL AT THE WINDOW, looking like it's spying on things. \nCORALINE(CONT'D) Well, what do you think? \nWYBIE Uhhh, I-I don't know. \nBACK TO KIDS. Wybie, astride his electric bike now, WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto his shoulders. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) Maybe she just ran away? \nWe hear Wybie's agitated grandmother call out. \nWYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne! \nWybie turns away: he's said too much. \nWYBIE Look, I gotta go. \nHe starts to pull away. \nCORALINE Wait a minute! \nSTREAMS OF WATER. \nArriving beside Coraline, he waggles his finger at the naughty snapdragons. \nOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Tickle no more, you dragon snappers! \nThen he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to Coraline. She nods thanks. \nCORALINE Well, she says it's time for dinner ... breakfast ... food? \nOTHER FATHER Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you something! \nShe does. The Other Father grabs the GEARSHIFT KNOB, pulls it, and the mechanical mantis SPROUTS WINGS. They RISE in the air. Looking down, she sees that the garden is a PORTRAIT OF CORALINE. \nCORALINE I can't believe you did this! \nOTHER FATHER Mother said you'd like it! Boy she knows you like the back of her hand. \nHe pulls a lever and they ZOOM out of frame. \nINT. OTHER KITCHEN - SAME \nCoraline doesn't hold back this time. She stacks sausages on eggs on top of waffles, rolls it up and stuffs it in her mouth. The Other Mother FEEDS BITS OF SAUSAGE to the HUNGRY SNAPDRAGONS bouquet now in a vase. \nCORALINE Mmmm...so good! \nOTHER FATHER I love dinner, breakfast food. \nOTHER MOTHER Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner. \nCORALINE Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong. \nOTHER FATHER Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo. \nCoraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal, while her Other Parents smile at one another. \nOTHER MOTHER Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs. \nCORALINE My friend? \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. Other Mother opens it to reveal the OTHER WYBIE. He's cleaner, with better posture, and cute button eyes. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born. \nThe boy nods, button eyes shining. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Hello? \nHe just makes a shy smile, doesn't answer. She's confused. \nOTHER MOTHER I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less. (shrugs, smiling) So I fixed him. \nCORALINE So he can't talk at all? \nOTHER MOTHER Nope. \nShe looks Other Wybie over appreciatively. \nCORALINE Hmm, I like it. \nOTHER MOTHER \n(PROUDLY) Now run along, you two, and have fun. \nCoraline heads out the door with the mute boy. \nEXT. OTHER ESTATE HOUSE - SAME \nThe Other House \u00ad lit by amber spotlights looks MAGICAL with ornate GINGERBREAD TRIM; glowing TOPIARY in the yard. The kids come out the front door. \nCORALINE You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. \nOther Wybie nods in agreement. Coraline and he start up the stairs to Bobinsky's. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she... \nShe points to her mouth. There's an awkward moment and then he points past her, excitedly: a SMALL BLIMP is flying towards Bobinsky's door. \nThey run up the stairs and watch it slip through an opening above his door. Coraline knocks and the door suddenly SPINS, THROWING THEM INSIDE. \nINT. OTHER MR. BOBINSKY'S FLAT - SAME \nThey somersault to a stop and sit up. Down two rows of SMALL CANNONS that face each, an amazing MINIATURE CIRCUS has been set up, with a FERRIS WHEEL beside it. \nCORALINE Whoa... cool! \nCoraline goes right to the Ferris wheel where a MECHANICAL CHICKEN eats dried corn on the cob, fires up its belly, then POOPS OUT POPCORN into paper bags. \nOther Wybie stomps a firing button and COTTON CANDY shoots out of a cannon. He catches the cone, then starts firing off all the cannons. Coraline looks back to find him covered in the cotton candy. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Look at you! \nSpotlights come on in the big top, the entrance opens, and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers. \nOTHER MR. BOBINSKY (O.S.) Lady and gentleman! For to tickle your eyes and ears and making hearts to thump, I \u00ad Sergei Alexander Bobinsky \u00ad am introducing... \nShe makes the hand-thumb bottle sign. Charlie leans in to Coraline, pinches her nose. \nCHARLIE Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer. \nCoraline cuts him off, embarrassed. \nCORALINE Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. \nDad sighs, heads up the steps to his appointment as Mel and Coraline drive off. \nINT. UNIFORMS DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME \nPRESIDENT'S DAY SALE. Mel piles gray blouses, a navy skirt, white socks onto the arms of a CLERK. \nSitting alone on some stairs, Coraline sees a pair of fancy GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES. \nAs she tries them on, a YOUNG RASCAL in costume with sword BOUNCES PAST her down the stairs on a WHEELED STEP STOOL - his FATHER in pursuit. \nYOUNG RASCAL My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!! \nThere's an off screen crash, then the step stool rolls back to Coraline. She gets an idea. \nMel is checking out school blouses, when Coraline rolls past, first one direction, then the other, modeling the colorful gloves. Without looking up, her mom tells her: \nMEL Put them back. \nCORALINE But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. \nMEL Put them back. \nCoraline mutters: \nCORALINE My other mother would get them. \nMEL Maybe she should buy all your clothes. \nCoraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves. \nINT. CAR - SAME \nCoraline and Mel are driving home, shopping bags in back. \nCORALINE So what do you think's in the other apartment? \nMEL I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters. \nCORALINE Then why'd you lock the door? \nMEL (shorter than previous) Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer. \nCORALINE They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. \nMEL Your school might be fun. \nCORALINE With those stupid uniforms?   Right. \nMEL Had to give it a try. \nThey pull into their DRIVEWAY. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nMel pulls out salsa, mustard, catsup, stale tortillas from the fridge. \nMEL How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch? \nCoraline, carrying in the bags from outside, makes a face. \nCORALINE Are you kidding me? \nMEL Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special. \nCoraline squinches up her nose. \nCORALINE Gross-gusting. \nMEL \n(BRIGHTENS ) You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like. \nCoraline plops down in a chair. \nCORALINE Oh, like the gloves? \nMel reaches out and musses Coraline's hair. The girl pulls away. \nMEL Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up. \nCORALINE That's what you always say. \nMom rolls her eyes, shaking her head, and opens the door to leave. \nMEL Won't be long. \nShuts the door. \n(SKEPTICAL) The Other Mother hates cats? \nCAT \n(CONTEMPTUOUS) Not like any \"mother\" I've ever known. \nCORALINE What do you mean? She's amazing! \nCat climbs the tree's branches onto the roof. \nCAT You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so. \nCORALINE That's nonsense. He can't talk. \nThe cat looks at her, pitying her lack of intelligence. \nCAT Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and -- \nSuddenly, the cat drops into a crouch and freezes, sensing something. \nCAT (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERING) Shhhh! I hear something! Right ...over... \nHe SCRAMBLES across the roof and disappears around the corner. \nCoraline shrugs, skeptical, and heads down to Spink and Forcible's, their door now circled with CHASER LIGHTS. \nINT. MISS SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S OTHER APARTMENT - SAME \nShe pushes past elegant VELVET CURTAINS to discover an enormous, darkened THEATER with dim rows of seats and a high WOODEN STAGE. \nA FLASHLIGHT comes towards her, carried by a black SCOTTIE DOG with button eyes. He looks up at her, sniffs, then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of BUTTON-EYED SCOTTIES, to a front seat by the Other Wybie. She squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly. \nCORALINE Hey, Wybie. \nLight flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open on a SEASIDE SETTING with ROTATING WAVES. OTHER MISS SPINK rises up on stage left, in a MERMAID SUIT, large WIG, BUTTON EYES, and UKULELE. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \n(SHOCKED) She's practically naked! \nAnd Miss Spink sings. \nOTHER MISS SPINK I'm known as the siren of all seven seas The breaker of hearts by the bay. \nA flat cut-out ship manned by cut-out men rows in behind her. \nOTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D) So, if you go swimmin' With bow-legged women, I might steal your weak heart away. \nShe bows her head and the audience of dogs THUMP their tails. \nSpink is LOWERED through the stage floor, the SCENERY CHANGES, and on the right, a huge SCALLOP SHELL RISES up with the OTHER MISS FORCIBLE, clad in the bare minimum - her homage to Botticelli's BIRTH OF VENUS. She's facing the wrong way. \nCORALINE (whisper, to Wybie) Oh my God. \nA dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to the audience and begins the next verse. \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE A big-bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves, And hope to lead sailors astray, But a true ocean goddess, Must fill out her bodice, (indicates her ample bosom) To present an alluring display. \nThe dogs thump and woof, Wybie and Coraline clap. \nSpink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the competition. Rising up, she makes it clear just who she's dissing. \nOTHER MISS SPINK Beware of old oysters, too large in the chest, Let's banish them from the buffet. \nBut Forcible is up to the challenge - the scenery starts to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and down, competing. \nOTHER MISS SPINK (CONT'D) I'm far more nutritious \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE You smell like the fishes \nOTHER MISS SPINK Did I hear a banshee? \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE You're sea-green with envy \nOTHER MISS SPINK This mermaid enchantress, \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE No, I \"Birth of Venus!\" \nThe set rigging can't take it anymore -- ropes snap, sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall. \nOTHER MISS FORCIBLE \n(CONT'D) Will send sailors swooning --oh--! \nOTHER MISS SPINK Will send sailors swooning --oh--! \nWith a crash, the old ladies TUMBLE DOWN IN A PILE. Coraline winces. The audience HOWLS with laughter as the curtains close on the disaster. \nDRUM ROLL. A SCOTTIE DOG pushes a large BUCKET OF WATER, labeled \"POOL\", onto center stage. Spotlights tilt up to the top of very tall diving platforms WHERE THE OLD LADIES NOW STAND. Coraline can't stand it. \nCORALINE \n(WHISPERS) I can't look! \nYOU'RE NOT SEWING BUTTONS IN MY EYES! \nOTHER MOTHER Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here. \nOther Father tests the needle on his finger. \nOTHER FATHER \n(ENTHUSIASTIC) So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww! \nOther Mother KICKS him under the table. Embarrassed, he puts the needle back in the box. \nOTHER MOTHER There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you. \nShe walks over and puts her hand, now ICY COLD, on Coraline's shoulder. Coraline PUSHES it away and STANDS \nUP. \nCORALINE I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! \nOTHER MOTHER \n(WOUNDED) Bed? \nOTHER FATHER Before dinner? \nCoraline fights to control her quaking voice. \nCORALINE I'm really, really tired. Yeah... (fakes huge yawn) I just need to sleep on things. \nOther Mother stands, masking disappointment. \nOTHER MOTHER Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in. \nCoraline backs away, urging them to stay where they are. \nCORALINE (palms out, forced smile) Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already-- \nShe turns to leave and finds the Other Mother BLOCKING THE DOORWAY. Other Father joins her. \nOTHER MOTHER You're welcome. And I \u00ad (smiles to Other Father) we aren't worried at all, darling. \n(SOFTLY) Soon you'll see things our way. \nShe lets go. She and the Other Father herd Coraline across the hallway to the stairs. \nINT. OTHER HALLWAY, STAIRS, UPPER HALL - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline carefully climbs the stairs, the Other Parents watching. When they can no longer see her, she RACES up the last steps and DASHES to her Other Bedroom. \nINT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - TWILIGHT \nCoraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by fluttering DRAGONFLIES. \nMAGIC DRAGONFLY What's wrong, Coraline? Don't you want to play? \nShe jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the TOY CHEST and tosses them in. \nThe PLUSH BLUE SQUID greets her from the shelf, followed by the TOY TANK GIRAFFE. \nTOY SQUID Yeah, I wanna hugga your face! \nTOY TANK GIRAFFE Get a grip, soldier. \nShe GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest. \nHer PHOTO FRIENDS - NOW WITH BLACK BUTTONS FOR EYES - call out from the photo by her bed. \nPHOTO FRIENDS Hey! \nPHOTO FRIEND 1 Where's yer buttons, yuper? \nPHOTO FRIEND 2 You wanna stay, don'tcha? \nCoraline grabs them as well, drops them in the chest, and SHUTS the lid. She barricades the door with a DRESSER and CHAIRS and then the TOY CHEST. \nCORALINE I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. \nShe sits on the bed, pulls off the blue boots then CLIMBS UNDER THE COVERS, pulling them over her head and holding tight. She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at home. She closes her eyes and tells herself: \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! \nShe tosses one way, then another. WE HEAR her voice \nCONTINUE: \nCORALINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Go to sleep, go to sleep... \nThere are strange, backwards sounds, then the eerie voices of Other Mother and Other Father. \nOTHER MOTHER (V.O.) There's just one tiny little thing we have to do. \nCORALINE Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... \nOTHER FATHER (V.O.) So sharp you won't feel a thing... \nCAT (cont'd) She wants something to love, I think. Something that isn't her... Or maybe she'd just love something to eat. \nCORALINE Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters! \nCAT I don't know. How do you taste? \nOTHER HOUSE REAPPEARS \nA SHAPE RISES in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful OTHER HOUSE. Coraline and the cat slow, then the front yard and topiary, the sky, hills, white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them FILL \nIN. \nCORALINE Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it? \nThe cat curls its tail into a question mark, and tips its head to one side. \nCAT Walk around the world. \nCORALINE Small world. \nCoraline shivers. The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a shrub. \nCAT Hang on-- \nHe bounds towards the shrub and chases out a CUTE KANGAROO MOUSE in uniform with a TINY TRUMPET. Before Coraline can blink, he's PINNED IT DOWN. \nCORALINE Stop, he's one of the circus mice! \nWith a SWIFT BLOW of its paw, the cat KNOCKS the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth. He gives a QUICK, KILLING BITE - CORALINE GASPS - and the mouse TRANSFORMS into a BIG DEAD RAT. Coraline is stunned. He drops the rat on the ground. \nCAT I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm. \nThe cat picks the rat up and heads off. Slack-jawed, Coraline speaks with admiration. \nCORALINE Gooooood kitty. \nCoraline looks to the house with a determined look. \nOn the porch, she takes out a HEAVY CANE from the UMBRELLA STAND and hits it into her hand. \nINT. HOUSE,   OTHER HALLWAY - SAME \nCoraline, standing in front of the living room doors, TESTS the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for danger. It's dead quiet -- no piano, no sounds of anything. \nShe JAMS the cane through the doors' handles, and PULLS with all her might. One HANDLE AND LOCK BREAK and the door swings open into the pitch black living room. The hall light casts a narrow path directly to the Other Little Door on the far wall, cracked open. She steps into the room. \nINT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nA huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow. The room has been TRANSFORMED into an amazing BUG MUSEUM, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. The radiators are now big caterpillars, the Nordic Track a serving bug. \nThe Other Mother speaks out, startling Coraline. \nOTHER MOTHER (O.S.) They say even the proudest -- \nThe sofa, now a LARGE BUG, turns in place to reveal her sitting on it. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) --spirit can be broken ... with love. \nShe's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out in a behold my handiwork gesture. \nA BUG CHAIR scoops up Coraline and brings her to the Other Mother. \nThe Other Mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one? \nShe extends a CANDY DISH filled LIVING CHOCOLATE BEETLES. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) They're Cocoa Beetles from Zanzibar. \nCoraline is disgusted. The Other Mother takes back the dish and BITES OFF THE HEAD OF ONE. It's the first thing she's eaten in the film. \nCORALINE I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go. \nThe Other Mother FROWNS, swallows. She speaks with a FRIGHTENING STEELINESS in her voice. \nOTHER MOTHER Is that any way to talk to your mother? \nCoraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave. \nCORALINE You aren't my mother. \nThe Other Mother STRAIGHTENS. Her button eyes, now DEAD, stare into Coraline's. \nOTHER MOTHER Apologize at once, Coraline! \nCoraline stares right back, not blinking. \nCORALINE No. \nOTHER MOTHER \n(TENSELY) I'll give you to the count of three. One... \nThen she stands up, GROWING TALLER. \nCORALINE Has she taken those, too? \nSWEET GIRL GHOST Yes, miss. And hidden them. \nBOY GHOST Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed. \nCORALINE I ... I'll try. \nThe ghosts PULSE with hope. Coraline sits down against the mirror door, bounces her head against it. She's not hopeless. \nSuddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER \nOUT! \nINT. OTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT \nC.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the hands that hold her. She GRABS one and, FLIPS her MASKED ATTACKER onto the ground. She pulls off his mask: it's the OTHER WYBIE, his mouth stitched into a PAINFUL, EAR \nTO EAR SMILE. \nCORALINE \n(PANTING) \nWYBIE?.. \nCoraline sits him up. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Did she do this to you? \nShe unstitches his painfully-huge grin. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I hope that feels bet-- \nOTHER WYBIE Shhh. \nHe stops her with a finger to her lips, and points to the Other Living Room, its door UNLOCKED AND OPEN. He grabs her hand and PULLS her there. \nINT. OTHER LIVING ROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nIt's dark, the bug furniture asleep. They run to the big armoire bug that guards the little door and SHOVE IT out of the way. It CRASHES to the floor. And from upstairs, a voice calls out. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline? Is that you! \nCORALINE Let's go! \nShe opens the little door. A COLD WIND blows from the dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline... \nThe tunnel MOVES at the sound of her voice. Coraline takes Other Wybie's arm. \nCORALINE Come on. She'll hurt you again! \nHe shakes his head no, then pulls off his glove to reveal a HAND MADE OF SAWDUST. He blows his fingers away. \nHIGH HEELS CLICK from the stairs; she's ALMOST THERE! \nTALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) Coraline? How dare you disobey your mother!! \nOther Wybie shoves Coraline into the tunnel and shuts the door. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nHunched down, she moves as quickly as she can, tearing through the sticky cobwebs. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER (O.S.) (calling after her) Coraline! \nStrands of web brush her face, stick to her hair; she closes her eyes, hands out until she finally gets to the little door at the other end. She DIVES, TUCKS, -- \nINT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS TIME, BUT DAY HERE \n-- AND ROLLS OUT onto the REAL LIVING ROOM FLOOR. Coraline SLAMS the door shut and turns the sharp little key \u00ad still in the keyhole \u00ad to LOCK IT. \nShe stands, covered in dust and cobwebs, and calls out with joy and relief. \nCORALINE \nI'M HOME! \nINT. HALLWAY, STAIRWAY, DAD'S STUDY - SAME \nShe goes quickly through the apartment, happily calling: \nCORALINE Anybody here? Hello, hello, hello! Real Dad ... Real Mom! \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nCORALINE Oh, Mom's groceries! \nThere are bags of groceries on the table, as if her mother had just gotten in. She pulls open a bag to peek and FRUIT FLIES shoot out. The food is spoiled. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \n(PUZZLED) Uhhh. That's disgusting. \nHolds her hands up. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) But it's all a trap! \nWybie, eager to escape, cups hand to ear by the window. \nWYBIE Yeah... Uh, I think I heard someone calling me, Jonesy. \nCoraline sees right through him. \nCORALINE Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat! \nHe moves around her towards the door, turns to leave. \nWYBIE The cat... I-I'll just tell Gramma that you couldn't find the doll-- OW! \nA blue boot - thrown by Coraline - HITS his arm. He turns back as she takes off the second one. \nCORALINE You're not LISTENING TO ME! \nWYBIE That's ... cause ... you're CRAZY! \nHe FLEES as the second boot flies past. Coraline GROWLS, and gives chase. \nINT UPPER STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShe grabs her boots from the floor, and CHASES him down the stairs in her socks. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR/DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS, RAINING \nDoor flies open and Wybie RUNS down the front steps to his electric bike. Coraline RACES down after him. \nCORALINE You creep! \nWYBIE (calling over his shoulder) Crazy!! \nHe RUNS his bike towards the FALLEN TREE, HOPS ON and PEDALS LIKE MAD. As Coraline hurls a boot at him, he GUNS the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway. \nCORALINE Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll! \nOut of breath, she turns away and notices her PARENTS' CAR parked to the side. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Mom!   Dad! \nExcited, she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the car. \nINT. JONES' CAR - SAME \nCoraline, standing in the rain, excitedly looks through the car's window. But the car is EMPTY. She spots her mom's PHONE, then opens the door to grabs it and speed dial a number. \nCORALINE Pick it up, Dad, pick it up. \nCHARLIE (V.O.) Hi! \nCORALINE Dad!   Whe- \nCHARLIE (V.O.) I'm digging in my garden right now, but leave a message and I'll get right back to you. \nShe dejectedly looks at the phone, then snaps it shut. \nCORALINE Where have you gone? \nINT. SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nMiss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried- looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap. \nCoraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside her. \nCORALINE Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones? \nMISS SPINK Just looking ahead dear... Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late. \nMISS FORCIBLE (O.S.) April? Aren't you getting ready? \nMISS SPINK (looks off camera) We've lost our ride, Miriam. Caroline says her parents have vanished, quite completely. \nANGLE ON Miss Forcible, tightening her elaborate corset behind a screen, using pulleys and hooks. \nMISS FORCIBLE What?! We've waited months for those tickets. \nOne of the corset hooks FLIES UP and pulls off her wig. She ignores it and comes over to address Spink. \nMISS SPINK I suppose we could walk! \nMISS FORCIBLE With your gamy legs? It's nearly two miles to the theater! \nCoraline CLEARS HER THROAT, frustrated. \nMISS SPINK Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents. We know just what you need. Miriam, get...that's right. \nMiss Forcible grabs another dish of old stuck-together candy and puts it in front of Coraline. \nCORALINE How is hundred-year-old candy going to \nHELP-- \nINT CORALINE'S BEDROOM   - CONTINUOUS \nSeries of quick shots of Coraline getting ready to go. Pulls her collecting bag from the closet, her puffy vest, her boots; grabs a candle and garden shears, puts them in the bag. She stands to go, taking her cap off the chair. The ODD PIECE OF CANDY, the triangle green one with the hole, drops to the floor. She hesitates a moment, then sticks it in her bag. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWe hear the click of the door being unlocked. It opens to reveal the cat, and - holding a lit candle - Coraline. She leaves the key in the lock, like always, takes a breath and crawls forward. \nThe candle casts huge, flickering shadows along the wall. The cat, his voice returned, SPEAKS to her. \nCAT You know, you're walking right into her trap. \nCORALINE I have to go back. \nWith great feeling, she explains: \nCORALINE (CONT'D) They are my parents. \nCAT Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games. \nCoraline thinks about it, remembering. \nCORALINE Hmmm, okay. \nThe door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK. Coraline tenses when a voice calls out. \nMOTHER Coraline? \nCORALINE Mom? \nThere, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue, Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes, calls. \nMOTHER Coraline, you came back for us! \nCORALINE \n(RELIEVED) \nMOM! \nShe runs forward eagerly and-- \nINT. OTHER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \n--out the Other Little Door, throwing her arms out to hug her real Mom. \nMOTHER Darling! (voice shifting) Why would you run away from me? \nCoraline sees her mother's hand GROW as it wraps around her. Alarmed, she PUSHES AWAY and sees the DECOY MOM grow into the TALL OTHER MOTHER. \nThe room LIGHTS UP with the glowing bug furniture and a fireplace fire. \nCoraline tries her best to be brave. \nCORALINE Where are my parents? \nThe Tall Other Mother's button eyes GLITTER. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER Gosh, I have no idea where your \"old\" parents are. Perhaps they've grown bored of you and run away to France? \nHer teeth gleam. \nCORALINE They weren't bored of me.   You stole them! \nOther Father, a FOOT SHORTER than before, his sagging face a pale PUMPKIN color, his hair VINES, comes up behind Coraline. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER Now, don't be difficult, Coraline. Have a seat, won't you? \nOther Father, GURGLING happily, herds Coraline onto the walking bug chair. \nThe Tall Other Mother, standing by the little door, turns to it and CLAPS her hands. \nA moment later, a HUGE RAT skitters out of the tunnel - FILLED AGAIN with spider webs and children's things - carrying the KEY from the real world door. \nThe Tall Other Mother takes the key, locks the door, and - while the armoire bug assumes guard position - she \nSWALLOWS THE KEY. \nCORALINE \n(OFFHAND) Why don't you have your own key? \nOTHER FATHER Only one key. \nThe Other Mother PULLS A VINE growing from his ear, \nSHUTTING HIS MOUTH. \nTALL OTHER MOTHER Shhh! \n(SUNNIER) The garden squash need tending, don't you think, pumpkin? \nShe turns him around, her hands under his arms and drags him out. \nOTHER FATHER Squish squash, pumpkin sauce... \nOut the kitchen window, the FANTASTIC GARDEN LIGHTS UP, answering her question. She FURROWS HER BROWS, thinks this was too easy. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Hmmm. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OTHER GARDEN - SAME \nCoraline walks through the gates. The bright magic of the garden is DARKER NOW, with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers. \nShe passes the PITCHER PLANTS, and the one with the frog suddenly SWALLOWS the animal. \nShe goes up the steps past the BLEEDING HEARTS, which now LEAK STICKY RED JUICE that runs down the wall. \nAt the top, a few SNAPDRAGONS, feeble now, SNAP at her. She KICKS them down. Behind her, a brick tree ring OPENS like a monster's MOUTH and five HUGE, PALE SNAPDRAGONS sneak towards her. They ATTACK, knock her to the ground, spilling her bag. \nCORALINE No!! \nThey GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE \nMOUTH. \nCoraline is just able to GRAB her GARDEN SHEARS. She CUTS OFF one mutant snapdragon's head, then another, until she is free. The HEADLESS STEMS retreat into the rock mouth. \nCoraline, winded, goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of HUMMINGBIRDS/WASP HYBRIDS SWOOP IN. They don't attack her; instead they poke their long beaks into the TRIANGLE CANDY WITH THE HOLE and LIFT OFF. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Stop!! \nCoraline chases them, but they're getting away. As she crosses the little bridge, she takes off her cap and FLINGS IT LIKE A FRISBEE at them. SCORE! They fall to the ground, near the eyebrow shrubs, sawdust spilling out. She picks up the triangle candy. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Why steal this? \nWith a look of what does she have to lose, she holds it up to her eye and GASPS. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Wow... \nEVERYTHING IS BLURRY GREY like a pencil drawing, all color gone. She scans the garden, turning slowly. As she turns back to where she started, she sees something, right in front of her: a BURNING RED EMBER -- A GHOST'S \nEYE! \nCORALINE (CONT'D) That must be it. \nShe lowers the stone from her eye, to see that the ghost's eye is the FADED STICK SHIFT KNOB from the preying mantis tractor, which STANDS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER with the Other Father, a SQUAT PUMPKIN MAN, at its controls, his own hands IMPRISONED IN THE MECHANICAL \nPIANO HANDS. \nHEADLIGHTS GLARE and the tractor ROARS TO LIFE. The mechanical hands FORCE Other Father to SHIFT GEARS, and the tractor LURCHES at Coraline, its arms SLASHING. She yells, backs away. Other Father calls in a garbled voice: \nOTHER FATHER Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee. \nCoraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in. \nOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Don't waaaanno hurrrrrt you. \nThe Other Father tries to steer the tractor away, but the mechanical hands are stronger. It moves onto the bridge - STUPIDLY SMASHING THROUGH THE PLANKS in front of it. Halfway over, it lurches, then STARTS TO FALL THROUGH THE HOLE IT HAS CREATED. The tractor hangs precariously for a moment. \nOther Father KICKS away one mechanical hand, and with ONE HAND FREE, manages to PULL OFF THE SHIFT KNOB. \nOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Taaaake it!!!!! \nCoraline DIVES FORWARD and just GETS THE KNOB before the tractor and Other Father fall away and SINK UNDER THE \nWATER. \nRippling out from Coraline like a gray wave, the entire \nGARDEN BECOMES ASHEN AND DEAD. \nCoraline CATCHES HER BREATH, shaken. The ghost eye/gear knob GLOWS RED, no magic candy necessary. \nBOY GHOST Bless you, miss, you found me! But there's two eyes still lost. \nCORALINE Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it! \nCoraline looks past the greyed garden towards the Other House. A LUNAR ECLIPSE has begun, the full moon a pale acid green. \nCoraline looks concerned, then resolved, and then she heads towards the house. A haunting version of Spink and Forcible's show song starts to play... \nEXT. OTHER HOUSE, STAIRWAY TO SPINK AND FORCIBLE'S - SAME \nCORALINE'S POV DOWN STAIRWAY: chaser lights circle the door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues. \nREVERSE ON Coraline. She carefully descends towards CAM. \nINT DOWNSTAIRS THEATRE - SAME \nWE SEE her flickering shadow and then Coraline appears behind the entry curtains. She steps close, pulls the curtain open. Song stops. \nPOV ON THEATER, quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains. She spots usher's FLASHLIGHT on the ground. \nON CORALINE - she picks it up, clicks it on, and STEPS FORWARD. She sweeps the light beam around, apprehensive, then HEARS SOMETHING overhead. She aims flashlight up and startles a NEST OF BAT-DOGS - half Scotties/half bats. One bares his teeth and GROWLS. She clicks off the light and shivers. \nOn stage, one spotlight and footlights FADE UP on a huge, wrapped SALTWATER TAFFY. It hangs from ropes and sandbags. \nShe cautiously climbs up onto the stage. A HUMAN-SIZED TAFFY THING - striped pale pink and green - can just be seen through the wrapper. She holds her TRIANGLE CANDY- WITH-HOLE to her eye. There is a BLUE-WHITE GLOW coming from inside the wrapper. \nINT. CIRCUS TENT - CONTINUOUS \nThe Other Mr. B is perched on a pile of MOLDY CHEESES in the center of the ring. He moves like all his bones are broken. \nOTHER MR. BOBINSKY If you stay here, you can have vhatever you vant, vsig-DA - alvays. \nCoraline raises the triangle candy to her eye, sees the AMBER GLOW coming from inside his hat. \nCORALINE You don't get it, do you? \nShe moves closer. \nOTHER MR. BOBINSKY I don't understand. \nSmall forms MOVE under the back of his coat. \nCORALINE Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. \nOTHER MR. BOBINSKY (last breath) Not even that anymore. \nCoraline pulls off his hat. Instead of his head, a HUGE PALE RAT SITS THERE - holding the circus ball. It barks at her then DIVES DOWN the coat collar. \nRATS leap from COAT SLEEVES and PANT LEGS, Coraline pulls back, HORRIFIED, as the clothes collapse, scanning around for the circus ball. \nThere's a rat bark behind her and she turns. The HUGE RAT - balanced on a wheel of cheese, circus ball in paws - TAUNTS HER, then RUNS THE CHEESE OUT THE DOOR! She GIVES \nCHASE. \nINT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS \nThe OTHER RATS RACE behind the twin rows of cannons - the cheese wheel rat rolls through them, heading towards the door! \nCoraline CHARGES. The cannons, manned by rats, FIRE COTTON CANDY at her. She's HIT in the side, her leg, her ribs; she weaves and STUMBLES, the shots landing like punches. \nCORALINE Ahhh! No!! \nA PET DOOR - perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel - appears in the front door as the rat approaches. \nCoraline looks up to see the PET DOOR OPEN and the CHEESE- \nWHEEL RAT HEADING THROUGH IT TO THE OUTSIDE. \nCoraline takes her triangle candy stone and THROWS IT as hard as she can AT THE RAT. \nThe whistling candy FLIES through the pet door towards the RAT, just outside. \nEXT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS \nThe RAT DUCKS, the CANDY MISSES, and the cheese-wheel rat ESCAPES down the stairs with the ball. \nINT. OTHER MR. B'S FLAT - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline, lurching forward, HOLLERS. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \nNOOOO! \nTwo waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND--. \nEXT. OTHER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \n--OUT onto the balcony which TEARS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE with ATTACHED STAIRWAY. \nCORALINE Noooo! \nThe whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment. \nWHEEZING for breath, Coraline pushes up on hands and knees and SCANS past the topiaries and poplars and white gravel driveway, looking for the cheese-wheel rat and circus ball. No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost eye. \nCoraline, lit by a NARROWING BAND of pale green light, turns to look at the moon. It's nearly covered now by the \nDARK BUTTON SHADOW. \nHer HAND stings from a scrape. BLOOD trickles from her knee. She feels nothing but COLD LOSS. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \n(DEVASTATED) Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost everything. \nShe sobs, hugs knees and face to chest. The band of light that illuminates her is narrowing to near-gone. \nIn the foreground, the HEAD of the cheese-wheel rat - CIRCUS BALL IN ITS TEETH - DROPS ON THE GROUND. Sawdust leaks from its neck. Band of light STOPS NARROWING, the eclipse paused. \nThere's a familiar MEROWWW and Coraline looks up. \nAcross from her on the front yard, sits the BLACK CAT, licking his paws, rat's head and circus ball at his feet. \nCAT I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times. \nCoraline smiles, walks towards him. \nCORALINE I think you might have said something like that. \nCAT It looked like you needed this one, however. \nShe turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster, says: \nCORALINE I already know where you've hidden them. \nThe Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and sceptical. \nBELDAM Well... produce them. \nCoraline points to the little door. \nCORALINE They're behind that door. \nThe Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly. \nBELDAM Oh, they are, are they? \nA smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline. \nCoraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from?! \nThe cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline -- \nCAT There! \n-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE - \nOPAQUE WITH FROST. \nC.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back from them. \nCORALINE \n(WHISPERING) Mom.   Dad! \nON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns to Coraline, expectantly. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. \nThe Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns it, leaves the key in place. \nShe grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice. \nBELDAM You're wrong, Coraline! \nShe opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel. \nON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat - obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's thinking very hard. \nBELDAM (CONT'D) \n(PITYING) They aren't there. \nShe opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the Beldam softly gloats: \nBELDAM (CONT'D) Now you're going to stay here forever. \nCoraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can. \nCORALINE No ... I'm ... \nShe GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER \nHEAD. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) \nNOT! \nAnd she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL - face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD. \nFREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little door. \nCoraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side. \nThe Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO \nSHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES! \nANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug. \nON BELDAM, hands covering her face. \nBELDAM \nNOOOOOOOOO! \nHer hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN \nTHREAD! \nBELDAM (CONT'D) You horrible cheating girl! \nShe furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center. A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR! \nThe web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT. There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS. \nLOW ANGLE ON Coraline, moving away. The BELDAM'S HAND drops into frame and CREEP-CRAWLS after her. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I give you lots of kisses, And I give you lots of hugs ... \nEXT. WELL - SAME \nCoraline jams the SAME DEAD BRANCH Wybie used under the well's cover, lining it up over the SAME FULCRUM ROCK. \nCORALINE ... But I never give you sandwiches With grease and worms and mung beans. \nCircling around behind the BIG STUMP, the HAND SCAMPERS behind one rock to a bush to a tree, coming closer. \nCoraline manages to lever the well's cover off to one side, leaving the WHOLE WELL OPEN. Huffing and sweating, she wipes her brow, then takes the key string that's around her neck. \nThe hand, SEEING what is about to happen, RACES TOWARDS \nHER! \nCoraline lifts string and key, not quite over her head. \nThe hand JUMPS onto the big stump and SPRINGS through the air to GRAB THE KEY and PULL CORALINE TO THE GROUND! \nCoraline makes a CHOKED SCREAM, her fingers caught between the key string and her neck! \nThe HAND wants to DRAG HER BACK TO THE HOUSE and the \nLITTLE LOCKED DOOR THAT IS BREATHING WITH ANTICIPATION! \nA BLINDING HEADLIGHT hits HAND and CORALINE; an AIR HORN SOUNDS; and WYBIE LOVAT - hollering a BATTLE CRY all his own - comes SPEEDING DOWN THE BLUFF on his whining electric bike! \nWYBIE \nYAHHHHH!!!! \nWybie GUNS the throttle, and, leaning out, GRABS the confused HAND with his slug tongs! \nHe CIRCLES AROUND and HEADS TOWARDS THE WELL, readying to throw the hand in. But the HAND GETS FREE, and GRABS his handlebars. \nOUT OF CONTROL, Wybie's bike HITS A ROCK, and WYBIE AND HAND ARE THROWN RIGHT DOWN THE WELL. HOLLERING, he just manages to hang on with one hand! The Beldam's hand, caught on Wybie's coattail, SCRAMBLES UP his body and face and onto the well's edge where it STABS AT HIS FINGERS to make him fall! \nWYBIE (CONT'D) \n(STRUGGLING) Get off!! \nCoraline, choking, rises to her feet. She grabs her BLANKET and - in the still-blazing headlight of the crashed bike - she RUNS UP and THROWS IT OVER THE HAND. It fights like crazy as Coraline wrestles to control it. The hand STABS THROUGH THE BLANKET and SHAKES IT OFF. It crouches to attack her! \nAnd then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES. \nWybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing hard - removes the key and string from around her sore neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together with the string. The key is left attached. \nThe two friends carry the heavy package to the well and DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam, they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover in place. \nStill catching his breath, Wybie stands, holding his injured hand, its glove ripped by the Beldam's claw. He looks over at Coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight. \nWYBIE (CONT'D) I-I'm really sorry I didn't believe you about all this ... evil stuff, Coraline. \nCoraline, shoulders rising as she catches her breath, stands and smiles: he called her by real name for the first time. \nCORALINE Why did you change your mind? \nHe walks over, and takes out an old B&W photo from his jacket. \nWYBIE W-well, Gramma showed me this picture, after I called you crazy? \nHe hands it to her. \nANGLE ON PHOTO: two light-skinned black girls - dressed in old-fashioned clothing - stand in front of the Pink Palace, before it was divided into apartments. One looks just like the sweet ghost girl, and holds the DOLL WITH BUTTON EYES, which looks just like her. \nWYBIE (O.C.) (CONT'D) It's her and her sister, before she disappeared. \nANGLE ON WYBIE AND CORALINE. Behind them, blossoms fall like snow in the orchard. \nCORALINE The sweet ghost girl. \nWybie's grandmother, loud and worried, calls from the distance. \nWYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.) Wyborne!   Come home!! \nWYBIE (re: his grandmother) Oh, man...what am I going to tell her? \nShe looks up from the photo and smiles. \nCORALINE Just bring her by the house tomorrow.      We can tell her together. \nWYBIE We...we can?? \nCORALINE You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me. \nShe gives Wybie a playful punch on the arm and LAUGHS. \nWYBIE Wasn't my idea. \nThe BLACK CAT jumps up on the TREE STUMP and MEROWWS. Coraline smiles. \nWe TILT UP to the sky and see the last ropey clouds - like two clawed hands - clear away from the bright gibbous moon. \n", "test1_input": "THROUGH. \nINT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS \nCoraline MOVES FORWARD, towards the light ahead. \nINT. OTHER LIVING ROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS \nCoraline steps out through the same little door, into what looks like the EXACT SAME LIVING ROOM she just left, only something is different -- it feels deeper, more dimensional. \nCORALINE Huh? \nShe looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone. \nFrom across the hall, warm light comes from the kitchen and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) MMMMM, something smells good. \nINT. OTHER KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCoraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove, wearing an apron and ROOSTER-HEAD OVEN MITTS. The light and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect in this kitchen. Other Mother is facing away from Coraline as she works. \nCORALINE Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? \nHer mother turns from the stove to greet her and Coraline is DUMBSTRUCK: she's got BUTTONS FOR EYES! She beams with happiness at Coraline's arrival. \nOTHER MOTHER You're just in time for supper, dear! \nCORALINE You're not my mother. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... \nCoraline points to her own eye. \nOTHER MOTHER B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them? \nShe taps one with her nail. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) I'm your Other Mother, silly. Now go tell your Other Father that supper's ready. \nShe opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of great cooking fills the air. Coraline breathes it in, suddenly VERY HUNGRY. \nOTHER MOTHER (CONT'D) Well, go on. He's in his study. \nINT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME \nCoraline goes down the hall and opens the study door. \nINT. OTHER STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nShe sees the back of a man like her father, only with more hair. Instead of tapping away at his computer, though, he's picking notes on a BABY GRAND PIANO. \nCORALINE Hello? \nHe turns around. He, too, has SHINY BUTTON EYES. He seems happier and a little more handsome than real Dad, and wears an IRIDESCENT ROBE over POLKA DOT PAJAMAS, with ORANGE MONKEY SLIPPERS on his feet. He smiles broadly. \nOTHER FATHER Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song? \nCORALINE My father can't play piano. \nOTHER FATHER No need to ... this piano plays ME! \nDR. SEUSS GLOVES \u00ad connected with rods and pulleys \u00ad POP OUT of the piano's front and ONTO HIS HANDS. His hands RAISE UP \u00ad then DROP DOWN to play pounding STRIDE PIANO as Other Father SINGS out. \nOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) Making up a song about Coraline. She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine. She's as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line. \nCoraline is amazed as his hands fly. \nOTHER FATHER (CONT'D) When she comes around exploring Mom and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline. \nAnxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him. \nCORALINE I, uh \u00ad sorry \u00ad but she said to tell you the food's ready. \nOTHER FATHER Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand. \nHe sticks his hand up, still in a glove, and his other gloved hand slaps his face. She LAUGHS, then covers her mouth. \nINT. OTHER DINING ROOM - SAME \nOther Mother sets down a HUGE, ROASTED CHICKEN near Coraline on a table spread with CANDLES, fine CHINA and SILVER and a PINEAPPLE CENTERPIECE. FIGURE EIGHT MODEL TRAIN TRACKS circle twin LAZY SUSANS covered in dishes of POTATOES, SWEET PEAS, ROLLS, and CORN. The Other Father seals this Norman Rockwell moment by making PRAYER HANDS and a solemn face. \nOTHER FATHER We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast! \nHe laughs with glee then a STARTING BELL rings and it's time to eat. Other Father really digs in while Coraline tries some chicken. \nCORALINE Mmmm, this chicken is good. \nOTHER MOTHER Hungry, aren't you. \nCORALINE (nodding, mouth full) D'you have any gravy? \nOTHER MOTHER Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo- choo! \nOther Mother GIGGLES as a MODEL TRAIN circles round the track, pulling a GRAVY BOAT CAR and blowing its whistle. The train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with Coraline's plate, where it POURS GRAVY on her potatoes. \n", "test1_true": "Other Mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food herself. \nCORALINE (mouth full) I'm real thirsty. \nOTHER MOTHER Of course! Any requests? \nA beautiful CHANDELIER DRINK DISPENSER descends. \nCORALINE Mango milk shake? \nThe dispenser SPINS, stops and fills her glass while Other Mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that POP UP and LIGHT THEMSELVES while the words \"WELCOME HOME!\" write themselves in icing. Coraline is taken aback. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Home? \nHer Other Parents squeeze each other's hands warmly. \nOTHER MOTHER We've been waiting for you, Coraline. \nCORALINE For me? \nOTHER FATHER Yep. Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo. \nCoraline remains a little unsure. \nCORALINE I didn't know I had an Other Mother. \nOTHER MOTHER Of course you do. Everyone does. \nShe smiles at Coraline, her button eyes gleaming. \nCORALINE Really? \nOTHER MOTHER Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game. \nShe taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table. \nCORALINE \n(SKEPTICAL) You mean like, hide and seek? \nOTHER MOTHER Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain. \nCORALINE What rain? \nTHUNDER, LIGHTNING, then RAIN appears outside the window. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Huh, what about the mud? \nOTHER FATHER We love mud here! \nOther Mother rises, walks towards Coraline. \nOTHER MOTHER Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak. \nThe takes Coraline's rashy hand, but Coraline pulls it away. \nCORALINE \n(SUSPICIOUS) How'd you know I-- \nCoraline adjusts her tone. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I, I'd love to play, but ... I better get home to my other mother. \nOTHER MOTHER But I'm your other mother. \nCORALINE \n(BEFUDDLED) I mean my other other mother. Mom number one? \n(YAWNS) I think I should get to bed. \nOTHER MOTHER Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up. \nCORALINE (shakes head) But ... \nOther Father steps in beside her. \nOTHER FATHER Come along, sleepyhead. \nThey lead her from the table towards the stairs to her bedroom. \nINT. CORALINE'S OTHER BEDROOM - SAME \nIn this world, Coraline's bedroom is a dream come true: it is filled with rich color and light; there's a fire in the fireplace, a sheer, lacy canopy over her now beautiful bed. And her favorite toys are alive! \nCORALINE Wow. \nHer ORIGAMI DRAGONFLIES FLUTTER towards her. \nDRAGONFLIES Hello Coraline, hello, hello! \nHer BLUE SQUID greets her with a WAVE of its tentacle. \nTOY SQUID What's shakin', baby? \n", "test2_input": "CORALINE Hello. \nThe TURTLE SHELL she'd found CIRCLES HER FEET on clothes pin legs, making PANTING SOUNDS.

I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right? \nPHOTO FRIEND 1 We're already here, Coraline -- \nPHOTO FRIEND 2 \n-- gone to Or-e-gine! \nCoraline grins hugely, then, exhausted, she yawns, stretching out her arms. \nThe Other Mother, in the bedside chair, takes her hand and applies some SOOTHING BLACK MUD to Coraline's poison oak rash. \nCORALINE Oh, the mud... \nThe Other Mother gently tucks her in then she and the Other Father smile at Coraline as she drifts off to sleep. \nOTHER MOTHER                  OTHER FATHER See you soon ...              See you soon ... \nPULL BACK MATCH \nDISSOLVE: \nINT. CORALINE'S REAL BEDROOM - MORNING \nCoraline awakens. She looks around expecting bright colors, a magic dragonfly. But it's just her NORMAL ROOM: moving boxes; cracks in the ceiling -- nothing's changed. \nShe notices the BUTTON-EYED DOLL on the chair where she left it, where the Other Mother was sitting. She picks it up, absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist. She stops, noticing that the rash on her wrist IS GONE. \nCORALINE \n(GASPING) It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nCoraline goes to the little door, still ajar. She peeks behind and finds the WALL OF SOLID BRICKS. Yes, it was only a dream. \nCORALINE \n(SOFTLY) Huh? \nShe shakes her head and pushes the door shut. The kettle blows from the kitchen. \nKITCHEN - DAY, GROUND FOG OUT WINDOWS \nBreakfast. Mel and Charlie finish their \"Go Lean Breakfast Twigs\" and mugs of instant coffee. Preoccupied with their work, they half-listen as Coraline recounts her dream, her breakfast untouched. FOG lies outside the windows. \nCORALINE It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. \nMEL \n(DISAPPROVING) Buttons for eyes, huh? (indicates untouched food) Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at least. \nCORALINE You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers. \nCHARLIE (pretend offense) Orange? My monkey slippers are blue. \nHe stands, put his dishes in the sink. Whispers over his \nSHOULDER: \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) \n(OPTIONAL) Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about? \nShe points to her rash-free wrists. He nods. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Because I have a terrible case of writer's rash. On my---. \nMel CLEARS HER THROAT, interrupting. \nMEL If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP. \nHe crisply salutes her, turns on his heel, and marches out the door. Mel gets up to clear the table with Coraline. \nMEL (CONT'D) Coraline, why don't you go visit downstairs? I bet those \"actresses\" would love to hear your dream. \nCORALINE Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. \nMEL \n(NODS) Uh huh. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. HOUSE, FRONT PORCH - MORNING \nIt's drizzling and a WHITE FOG has lowered over the house and grounds. Coraline \u00ad yellow rain poncho, garden SHEARS in hand \u00ad opens the front door. Stepping out onto the porch, she TRIPS on a big bundle of mail. Annoyed, she picks it up, starts leafing through the envelopes. \nCORALINE Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky... \nSmells something bad, sniffs the envelopes. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Ohh, Poo-eeeee! \nShe goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads \"Bobinsky there\" with an arrow that points up long, winding outside stairs. With an \"oh well\" shrug, she goes up. \nEXT. HOUSE, BOBINSKY'S - CONTINUOUS \nAt the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious. \nCORALINE H-hello?... \nShe knocks again. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I think our mail got mixed up.    Should I leave it outside or... \nThe door swings open. Curious, Coraline peeks inside: it's dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove and a caged chicken. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) Hmmm... \nSuddenly a HUGE BLUE MAN swings down behind her and \nSCOLDS: \nMR. BOBINSKY \nSEE-KRET... \nShe whips around to find MR. Bobinsky - upside down, reaching right at her face! She ducks and he reaches past her to his actual target - his door knob - and pulls it shut. The Russian giant, dressed in a sleeveless T-shirt and shorts, pulls a RAW BEET from his pants. He's not happy. \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) \n(SCOWLING) Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready, little girl! \nCORALINE \n(CONFUSED) Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for you. \nShe holds out his mail. Bobinsky takes it, smelling the stinky envelopes deeply. Nods approvingly. \nMR. BOBINSKY \n(SNIFFS) Mmmm... Noviseer. \nCORALINE Huh? \nMR. BOBINSKY New \"cheese\" samples. \nHe swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her on the balcony. Coraline backs away. \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Very clever, using this \"mix up\" to sneak my home and peek at meeshkas \nCORALINE Meeshkas? \nMR. BOBINSKY The Mice! \nCORALINE Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones. \nMR. BOBINSKY \n(BOWS) And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you can call me Mr. B, because amazing I already know that I am. \nHe smells his mail again, makes pleased sound, then seems to fall off the side of the third story porch! Coraline rushes over, looks down. He cartwheels in from the porch railing behind her. \nMR. BOBINSKY Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah. But the jumping mice play only toodle toot, like that. Is nice, but not so much amazing? So now-- (indicates smelly mail) --I switch to stronger cheese, and soon \u00ad \nVATCH OUT! \nHe opens his door, crouches low and turns. He hands her a beet. \nMR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D) Here, have beet. Make you strong. (salutes her ) Daas vee DAAN ya, Caroline. \nHe scuttles inside and slams the door shut. Coraline mutters. \nCORALINE Cor-a-line. \nLooking at the beet, she makes a disgusted sound and tosses it away, then heads down the stairs. \nEXT HOUSE, SOUTH SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS \nWhen she gets to the bottom, she starts towards the back, gardening shears out. \nCORALINE (to herself) Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot. \nMR.

It must've broke when you escaped. \nMom spots her bloody knee. \nMEL And cut your knee. \nCharlie crouches low, clutching his briefcase. \nCHARLIE Coraline, I asked you to count all the windows, not put your knee through them. \nCORALINE \nBUT- \nMel tells her. \nMEL Well, get yourself cleaned up, \n(WARMS) we're going out tonight. \nCHARLIE We gotta lot to celebrate! \nCoraline, confused, takes a stab. \nCORALINE You're talking about... your garden catalog? \nMEL Of course! What else? \nHer parents turn to leave the room. \nCORALINE But look at the snow on your clothes...? \nBut the snow melts without a trace. \nMEL \n(CONFUSED) What's gotten into you, Coraline? \nHer parents walk off. Coraline shrugs her shoulders and looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel. She cocks her head, deeply puzzled, then leaves the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT HOUSE - NIGHT, SKY CLEAR \nThe VW is parked out front, its interior light fading as light in Coraline's bedroom window switches on. We HEAR Charlie make a strangled sound. \nINT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FULL MOON RISING \nCoraline sits in bed -- pajamas washed and PATCHED, wounds-dressed, hair shining. The KEY hangs from a string around her neck. A gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky. \nCharlie wrestles with a blue stuffed-toy squid like it's an alien face-hugger then, FEIGNING DEATH, falls on the bed. Coraline LAUGHS. \nCORALINE So, gonna order the tulips? \nHe opens one eye, pretends he's never heard about this. \nCHARLIE What's that? \nCORALINE For the garden party!! \nHe sits up and kids her, tickling her face with the squid. \nCHARLIE I have no idea what you're talking about. \nCORALINE Dad! \nShe turns to Mom, arranging things on a shelf. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) So, Mom. Invitations? Don't forget the invitations. \nHer mother nods, points up. \nMEL Even Bobinsky? \nCORALINE Mr. B's not drunk, Mom, he's just...eccentric. \nCharlie LAUGHS. He bends down to kiss her. \nCHARLIE Good night, Coraline. \nAs he steps away, Mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter. She gives Coraline a \"told you so\" look, and she and Charlie leave the room. \nCoraline sits up excitedly and opens the box - it's the GREEN AND ORANGE GLOVES she'd wanted! She pulls one on to admire when the BLACK CAT appears outside her window \nCORALINE Oh, hello again. \nShe walks over to the window, opens it. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) You still mad? \nHis expression says yes, he's still mad. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I'm really sorry I threw you at her - the Other Mother? \u00ad it was all I could think of. \n", "test3_true": "Coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed. \nShe grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large PEARL, the CIRCUS BALL, and the GREY STICKSHIFT KNOB. She holds them out to the cat. \nCORALINE (CONT'D) I think it's time, don't you? To set them free? \nThe cat nods.

From behind CAM, CHIMES sound and GOLD LIGHT begins to shine on her. She turns toward us, shielding her eyes. \nCoraline's eyes adjust to the brightness to see the THREE GHOST CHILDREN, now transformed into GOLDEN ANGELS; EYES RESTORED, small fluttering WINGS ON THEIR BACKS. \nSWEET GIRL GHOST It's a fine, fine thing you did for us, miss. \nCORALINE Well, I'm glad it's finally over! \nA SHADOW crosses the faces of the three children. They gather around Coraline and bow their heads. \nSWEET GIRL GHOST \n(SIGHS) It is over and done with ... for us. \nSilent beat. \nCORALINE What about...me? \nThe tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably, then BLURTS \nOUT: \nTALL GIRL GHOST You're in terrible danger, girl! \nCoraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation. \nCORALINE But how?   I locked the door!? \nSWEET GIRL GHOST It's the key, miss, there's only one and the Beldam will find it. \nThe KEY ON THE STRING around Coraline's neck floats out in front of Coraline. She grabs it. \nThe three ghost children all embrace Coraline tenderly. \nBOY GHOST \n(WHISPERS) Tain't all bad, miss. Thou art alive ... thou art still ... living... \nThey begin to swirl around her, spinning faster and faster. Coraline starts to turn and then she -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORALINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n-- ROLLS HERSELF AWAKE IN HER OWN BED. FAST PULL BACK above her to find covers thrown off and the CAT awake by her side. \nCoraline lifts up her pillow and GASPS - the GHOST EYES ARE IN PIECES like hatched bird eggs. She takes out the key on its string and explains to the cat, her voice \nPANICKED: \nCORALINE I -- I've gotta hide this somewhere, s- somewhere she can never ... \nThe cat doesn't like the sound of this.

It scrambles out of frame in the direction of Coraline! \nEXT ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - SAME \nCoraline moves briskly, the house below, GRIPPING THE KEY that's tied round her neck. DARK, ROPEY CLOUDS reach like fingers across the gibbous moon. Coraline sings her father's nonsense song, her voice hardly trembling. \nCORALINE Oh.... my twitchy witchy girl, I think you are so nice ... \nEXT. ORCHARD - SAME \nShe moves down past the old fruit trees, now covered with BRIGHT SPRING BLOSSOMS that fall gently like snow. \nCORALINE ...

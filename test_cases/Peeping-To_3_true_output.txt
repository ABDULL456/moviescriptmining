His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile. 
HELEN ... I work in a public library - in the children's section... I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me... 
She takes a deep breath. 
HELEN In my spare time... I write. 
MARK What's embar... 
HELEN I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll... 
MARK Had any published? 
HELEN Some short stories. 
MARK I'd like to read... 
HELEN I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring... 
MARK But that's wonderful... what's it about? 
HELEN A magic camera - and what it photographs... 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
MARK Whatever made you... think of that? 
HELEN I'll tell you one day - I promise... 
MARK Well what does it photograph? 
HELEN I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree. 
MARK No - nothing's impossible. 
HELEN was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd... 
MARK Oh yes. 
HELEN discuss it with me. 
MARK take them. 
HELEN Mark - I can't ask you to do that... 
They have cancelled his Oscar. 
HELEN I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree. 
MARK I'd take them... for you. 
HELEN Yes but... the money. 
MARK There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing. 
HELEN I didn't mean to offend you. 
MARK Offend? 
CLOSE SHOT of Mark. 
MARK Helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that I don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty-first birthday... 
CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him... 
MARK What does your camera photograph? 
HELEN Mark - I must go... I just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me. 
MARK When please? 
HELEN That's up to you. 
MARK Helen ... I don't know much about... dinner out... but would you come with me? 
HELEN Thank you. 
MARK Thank you. 
HELEN When? 
MARK Oh... 
HELEN What's the matter? 
MARK It had better be soon... 
HELEN Are you going away? 
MARK Almost for certain! ... 
HELEN Oh... well you suggest when. 
MARK Are you free... tomorrow night? 
HELEN Yes. 
MARK I hope I am! 
HELEN I'll understand if you're not. 
MARK I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest to be. 
HELEN Thank you for listening... and for my present. 
MARK and for mine. 
They look at each other in silence. 
HELEN Good night, Mark... (turning to the door) 
MARK Good night... Helen... 
He watches her leave, standing very still. 
Offstage, the time clock explodes. 
CLOSE SHOT - the excited clock. Mark's hand silences it. 
INT. DARK-ROOM - GREEN LIGHT 
Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film, drops it into the fixing bath. 
He switches light from green to red. 
CLOSE SHOT - green to red dark-room lamp.

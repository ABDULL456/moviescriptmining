REAL ESTATE AGENT (beat) Very good, sir. 
INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris and Penny are having sex on the floor. 
PENNY So, man, are you seeing anyone? 
BARRIS Nobody serious. You? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PENNY No.   I think we should get married. 
BARRIS Aw, Pen, don't start -- 
PENNY No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. So, it makes sense. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Barris, 50, types away. He is sweaty and naked except for a towel draped over his head. 
BARRIS (V.O.) I liked Penny. I even loved her in my way. But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life... I remember my parents' marriage. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHILDHOOD KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Barris, five, sits at the dinner table with his parents. His father, dressed in a dental smock, stares down at his plate as he eats. His mother absently chews and stares vacantly into space. 
MOTHER We need a new ice box. 
The father shrugs. 
INT. DATING GAME SET - DAY 
The set, which holds four couples, divides in the middle to reveal a new refrigerator. 
ANNOUNCER A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker! 
One of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically, happy and in love and kissing. The other couples look disappointed and angry at their spouses. 
We pull back to reveal we're watching this on a tv in: 
INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - MORNING 
The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor, jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his desk, with a "Make Love Not War" helmet on his head, his feet up, and a guitar in his lap. 
BARRIS Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they loved each other just then? That's what it's all about, kiddies. 
Everyone agrees.   Someone switches off the tv. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) Okay, guys, new business. We're winning our slots every week. 
Everyone cheers. 
BARRIS (CONT'D) But that means we need you Bandits to get on the contestant mill. Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we're gonna really need you guys to carry your weight. Nuff said. Any other business? 
EMPLOYEE #1 Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got two. 
BARRIS Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are you? 
RICK Here.    No, it's not true. 
BARRIS Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction? 
EMPLOYEE #2 I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BARRIS Rick, you're dead meat, buddy. (shoots Rick with finger) I sentence you to... dance for us in today's post-meeting version of "Out of Limits" featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers. 
Everyone cheers. 
RICK Aw, Chuck. 
BARRIS Get up here, you rascule, you. 
Rick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments. They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits." Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping. 
MONTAGE 
As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many game shows, happily directing the bustling activity. 
INT. RANCH-STYLE LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The actual Jim Lange, host of The Dating Game.

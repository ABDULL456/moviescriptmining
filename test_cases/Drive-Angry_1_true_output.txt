MILTON Where is she? 
FUCKING DRIVER I...I don't... Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it. Milton spins and KAFOOM! Blows Fucking Passenger to hell. 
FUCKING DRIVER Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I don't know where exactly. They call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I know. I swear! 
Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash. 
FUCKING DRIVER But you're too late. You gotta know that. Next full moon she's dead. Nothing you can do. She's dead and hell will walk the earth-- 
WHAM! Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth, breaking a couple teeth in the process. Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched his thirst in a decade. 
MILTON You tell him I'm coming. You got that? I'm coming to get her back. You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna kill every last one of you fuckers. Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't look back. 
EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY 
Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner. It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound â67 GTO stands out. 
INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY 
Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7. Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat. 
PIPER So I tell him, I says, âFrank, that's it. No more free milk. You gonna have to buy the cow you son of a bitch.â 
NORMAJEAN But you're not fat, Piper 
PIPER Wha? No, NormaJean, âbuy the cow.â Marry me? He's got to marry me. I'm sayin I cut him off. 
NORMAJEAN You cut him off? 
PIPER Not just yes but hell yes! No tits, no ass. And I told him if I see that big ol' dick of his anywhere near my face I'm gonna bite it in half. Normajean giggles with embarrassment. 
NORMAJEAN You said that? How long's it been? Piper frowns. 
PIPER Well, it's only been two days but that's like a decade in horny fucker years. 
NORMAJEAN So he bought you a diamond? 
PIPER A diamond? God no. If Frank had money for a diamond I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shithole life in the rear view. But he did get down on his knees and ask me to be his bride. 
NORMAJEAN No way. 
PIPER Yes way! NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug. 
NORMAJEAN Oh! Piper! 
PIPER 
I KNOW! 
FF-FF-FFUMP! Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as -- Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.

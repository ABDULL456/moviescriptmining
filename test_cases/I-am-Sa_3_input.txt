SHOOTING DRAFT 
INT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M. 
We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry. 
We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling, uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes, they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars. 
SAM Double double decaf low-fat Cap. 
BRUCE You got it, buddy. 
SAM Good choice very good choice. 
Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks. 
SAM (CONT'D) Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half low, half non.  Excellent choice.  Very good choice. 
He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches. 
GEORGE Sam, they called.  It's time for you to go. 
Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Sam, did you hear me? 
SAM "It's time for you to go." 
GEORGE Yes. 
SAM It's time. 
GEORGE Good luck. 
Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY 
Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT BETWEEN THEM. 
SAM It's time.  It's time. 
Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS. 
SAM (CONT'D) It's time, it's time for you to go. 
INT. HALLWAY - LATER 
Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324. 
SAM Rebecca! 
Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL. 
REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black Nurse, looks up from the monitor. 
GERTIE You the one responsible for this? 
Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally. 
SAM I'm sorry. 
GERTIE Too late for sorries, daddy, get over here and hold her hand. 
Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS. 
NURSE You got a live one, Gert. 
INT. LABOR ROOM - LATER

FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN, American and French, RAISE THEIR VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME... 
With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony between Washington and Cornwallis, MARION quietly and unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks away. 
EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAY 
The surrender ceremony continues.  Marion, on the fringe of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to leave.  LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him.  They lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up. 
LEE Goodbye, Francis. 
MARION Goodbye, Harry. 
Marion reaches down.  They shake hands. 
MARION And congratulations on the birth of your son. 
LEE Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace. 
MARION I hope so. 
As Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops, speaking back to Lee over his shoulder. 
MARION Your son, what did you name him? 
LEE Robert.  Robert E. Lee. 
Marion smiles. 
MARION A good name for a farmer. 
Lee nods.  Marion rides off. 
EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY 
Marion's children and Charlotte sit by the river.  Samuel sits on the lookout ledge with his musket.  Suddenly he stands, looking out, seeing something. 
Charlotte and the others notice.  They're worried.  Then they see Samuel throw down his musket and tear down the path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining his feet... 
Charlotte and the others know who's coming... 
The children take off running after Samuel... 
Racing toward the road... 
Charlotte hurries after them... 
AND THEN THEY SEE HIM... 
MARION, riding at a full gallop... 
The children cry out with tears of joy... 
MARION see Susan... 
He gallops toward her... 
LEANS OVER... 
Without slowing, he SWOOPS HER UP into the saddle... 
She wraps herself around him... 
He reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other children reach him... 
They throw themselves into his arms... embracing him... 
Charlotte hurries up behind them... 
She and Marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs of his children. 
EXT.  POND BLUFF - EVENING 
Summer.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered with apples. 
Marion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable.  The workshop is already completed. 
MARION'S CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret and William, play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two GREAT DANES. 
CHARLOTTE sits on the front porch, NURSING AN INFANT. 
MARION walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan.  He carries a just-completed rocking chair. 
The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. 
He steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the rocking chair next to her. 
MARION Two pounds, fourteen ounces. 
CHARLOTTE Lovely. 
He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's position.  Then he sits down, settles back and begins rocking.  Not a creak. 
Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard, calling as she joins the other children. 
SUSAN Wait for me... 
As the CAMERA CRANES UP, Marion and Charlotte disappear beneath the overhang of the porch roof.  Suddenly, the SOUND OF A CRASH. 
MARION (O.S.) Damnation! 
The CAMERA CONTINUES TO CRANE UP as Marion walks off the porch, crosses the yard and enters his workshop.  A moment later, the SOUND OF MARION'S LATHE RISES. 
FADE OUT.

BOOM!   The door WHIPS open.    TWO THUGS spill into the room.

58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy). 
They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes' eyes widen at the giant. 
HOLMES Hello, gentlemen. 
Dredger is deadpan. 
DREDGER Sherlock Holmes. 
HOLMES Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man. 
DREDGER (smiles) You do like to talk. 
The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson. 
HOLMES You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth. 
WATSON Seems about fair. 
Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging at them. As they dodge and swing back -- 
Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye: 
He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it so the curtain-rings rain to the floor. 
He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly -- 
Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air, sending him flying into --

Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as -- 
Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head butting one, kicking the other in the groin. 
The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so -- 
The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground. 
As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade, which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring. 
58A                                                                 58A INT. REORDON'S LAB Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon. 
Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS. 
ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet -- 
58B   INT. REORDON'S ROOMS                                          58B Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as -- 
Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson, knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away. 
Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by the efficacy of the weapon. 
Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums. 
Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!! 
The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS Dredger back twenty more feet. (CONTINUED) 
58B     CONTINUED:                                                  58B Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as -- 
Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well. 
Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as he's about to grab it... 
THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING. 
Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as -- 
Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson picks up the ring, sees: 
The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

61      EXT. TOOLEY IRONWORKS - GATE                                   61 
Dredger runs down the street, knocking people out of his way. Holmes gives chase, darting around people, trailing Dredger through the gates of a huge commercial shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as --

62      INT. SLIPWAY - DAY                                             62 
Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed to see it smoothly into water. 
63      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY                          63 
For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through. 
Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this network of struts. They weave through the shadows. 
Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and -- (CONTINUED) 
63    CONTINUED:                                                  63 ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER. 
Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile. A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger: 
The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as -- 
Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.

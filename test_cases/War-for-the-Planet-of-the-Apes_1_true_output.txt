(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Caesar stares at the sight, growing sad, his mind distant... 
BAD APE (O.S.) Who is...? 
Caesar turns, startled to find Bad Ape watching him; Bad Ape nods toward the Girl. 
BAD APE (CONT'D) Child. 
CAESAR (a beat) I don't know. 
BAD APE (confused) But she... with you? 
Caesar nods. 
CAESAR She has no one else. 
Bad Ape gazes at the Girl, suddenly feeling sorry for her. 
BAD APE I see you look at her. Just now. (turns back to Caesar) Look sad. 
But Caesar says nothing.       Bad Ape studies him; then ventures: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) You... have child? 
Caesar turns -- Bad Ape smiles sweetly, expectantly... but Caesar just returns a withering look. Bad Ape falls silent. Caesar looks away. Then, quietly, stoically: 
CAESAR I had two.     But one was killed.   By human. 
BAD APE (quietly struck) Oh... Soldier? 
Caesar, still not looking at him, NODS. A silent beat, as Bad Ape looks down, pensive. Then softly: 
BAD APE (CONT'D) I had child... 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Caesar turns, surprised. Bad Ape stares at the ground, remembering, a little lost. Then slowly, he looks up. 
BAD APE (CONT'D) You think... you will find him... at human zoo? Soldier? 
Caesar's eyes drift to the dying embers. 
CAESAR I don't know... Maybe. 
Bad Ape ponders this.   Torn, he finally looks at Caesar: 
BAD APE Then... maybe I take you. 
Caesar turns from the fire, their eyes meeting as we CUT TO: 
EXT. FRONT OF THE INN - MORNING 
The Girl steps out alone onto the deserted porch, still wearing Bad Ape's parka. As she clutches herself against the cold, something catches her eye; she looks up overhead at the PINK FLOWERS of a perennial dogwood tree, poking through the snow -- the only color in an otherwise stark white world. 
With the muffled crunch of hooves, Luca and Rocket appear, guiding the four horses toward the porch. 
Luca notices the Girl staring up at the branch of flowers. 
He watches a moment, then moves toward her... and reaches his long arm up, snapping off a small piece of the branch. 
The Girl observes as Luca bends down, his massive gorilla face right in front of hers as he very gently slips the flowers behind her ear. She smiles. He blinks back at her sweetly, when -- 
Caesar and Maurice emerge onto the porch. Luca quickly straightens, resuming his tough guy demeanor. 
Maurice lowers next to the Girl, and she hops on his back. He moves to his horse, and climbs up with her. Caesar, Rocket and Luca mount up as well, when -- 
-- the front door SQUEAKS open; they turn to see Bad Ape stepping out to join them. He wears boots, an old wool blanket on his shoulders, and a striped toque on his head. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Caesar and the others stare at him, deadpan, but he is oblivious, looking from horse to horse, wondering where he's supposed to go. 
Luca GRUNTS gruffly, points him toward Rocket's horse.    Bad Ape smiles, and starts for Rocket's horse. 
Rocket looks miserable as Bad Ape struggles to climb up. 
EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAY 
The group silently weaves its way through snow-covered trees. 
The Girl watches curiously as Caesar removes his canteen from his saddle bag. Maurice notices her staring, follows her gaze to see Caesar drinking. Maurice grunts softly to her. She turns, and he gestures at Caesar, making the sign for: 
MAURICE [Thirsty.] (repeats for her, teaching) [Thirsty.] 
She just stares blankly at Maurice. He takes her small hand in his, demonstrating the way to sign the word. 
Caesar notices, lowering his canteen, quietly intrigued. 
Maurice demonstrates again. But the Girl shows no interest or understanding. Her eyes return to Caesar -- who for the first time softens, offering a sympathetic gaze. 
EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

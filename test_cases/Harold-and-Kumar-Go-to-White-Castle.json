{"train": "HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE \nWritten by \nJon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg \nScript Revisions \u00ad Double White May 28, 2003(b) \nFADE IN: \n1   INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM \nBILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, \"romantic\") is sitting at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex- girlfriend. \nMAN (O.S.) Billy Boy! J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters the office. \nJ.D. Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on! J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo. \nJ.D. Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it once and for all. J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back. \nBILLY Don't! \nJ.D. Dude, it's been six months.    You have to move on. BILLY nods knowingly. \nJ.D. You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long. \nBILLY You're such a romantic, J.D. \nJ.D. It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment. \nBILLY Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long. \nJ.D. Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   2. \nBILLY Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors. \nJ.D. So what? It's Friday!      You have all weekend to do that. \nBILLY No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow. J.D. thinks for a moment. \nJ.D. Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then? \nBILLY Who? J.D. gets a big smile on his face.    He has an idea. \n2   INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM                                 2 HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day. BILLY and J.D. approach... \nBILLY Harold, listen, I need you to update these models for me. \nHAROLD (confused) But aren't you supposed to... \nBILLY I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay? Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to protest, J.D. steps forward... \nJ.D. And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp. \n(MORE) \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003     3. J.D. (cont'd) With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking. He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next. \nHAROLD Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk. \n3   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM                    3 BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot. \nBILLY Wow!   I can't believe how easy that was! \nJ.D. Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE. \n4   INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE                                       4 Billy and J.D. enter the car. \nJ.D. Now get ready. It's time we embark on...Operation Get Some! And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut: \n5   INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE                                    5 Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it. When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner. J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his car zooms out of the parking lot. \nHAROLD (frustrated, to himself) Those assholes. The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud mouth), puts down his window... COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold. \nCOLE (mock Asian accent) This is America, dude! Learn how to drive! \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Better ruck tomorrow! Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   8. \n11A   EXT. SEMI-URBAN STREET                                      11A He ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel park. He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot. \n11B   EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING                  11B Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building... Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators. HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl. Harold takes a deep breath... \nHAROLD Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous. \n11C   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY                       11C Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They give each other a friendly smile. We hear a \"BING\" sound, indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and Harold and Maria walk inside. \n12    INT. ELEVATOR                                                12 HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak... \nHAROLD So Maria, what's been going on? \nMARIA Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week. How about you? \nHAROLD My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change. \nMARIA Really? \nHAROLD (deadpan) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   9. \nMaria laughs.   Harold's pleased that his joke worked. \nHAROLD So what are you up to tonight? \nMARIA Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place. He's cooking me a really nice dinner. \nHAROLD (disappointed) Really? \nMARIA (smiling) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. (beat) I'll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch Blind Date. \nHAROLD (playful) That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria.    They smile at each other... \nHAROLD Well, if you want some company, maybe you could sit on your ass at my place. \nMARIA (flirty) Maybe. \nWe hear the \"BING\" of the elevator... \n13   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING(LOBBY)                                 13 We're back in the lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A FANTASY. Harold and Maria enter the elevator. \n14   INT. ELEVATOR                                                  14 HAROLD and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up. It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator. \n15   INT. HALLWAY                                                   15 \nMARIA Bye. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   10. \nMARIA walks over to her apartment and goes inside. \nHAROLD Bye. \n16   INT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM                  16 Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of \"BILLY MADISON.\" \nHAROLD Kumar? \nKUMAR (O.C.) Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however. \nHAROLD Kumar? \nKUMAR (O.C.) In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a \"clipping sound\" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside... \nHAROLD Kumar, what the hell are you doing! \nKUMAR So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building... \n26A   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING                                    26A Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep. They're about to get back in the jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them. \nCOLE Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag! (to Harold and Kumar) Let me guess, the yellow one's the catcher! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   20. \nCOLE AND THE PUNKS LAUGH HYSTERICALLY. Harold is uncomfortable. Kumar just ignores them. \nCOLE (to the Punks) Come on, guys! Let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew! \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme! They take off, driving by Harold and Kumar.   Harold gives them a pissed off look as they drive away. \nHAROLD Why do I have to be the catcher? \nKUMAR Dude, forget about those pricks.    Let's just go. They continue walking... \n27   OMIT                                                         27 \n28   EXT. STREET                                                  28 Harold and Kumar finally reach Harold's car... \nKUMAR (getting frustrated) Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. (beat) And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb. \nHAROLD Don't even start. \nKUMAR (laughing) Just fucking with you.   Now let's go out and get those burgers.   I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a \nMCDONALD'S. \n29   OMIT                                                         29 \n30   OMIT                                                         30 \n31   OMIT                                                         31 \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   21. \n32   OMIT                                                         32 \n33   OMIT                                                         33 \n34   EXT. HIGHWAY - 8:30 PM                                       34 We see Harold's Infiniti driving down the highway. \n35   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       35 Harold is meticulously rolling a joint. \nKUMAR Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay? \nHAROLD Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... (in a gay C3PO voice) \"Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!\" Kumar laughs. \n36   EXT. HIGHWAY - 8:45PM                                        36 Harold's Infiniti approaches a line of TOLL BOOTHS. \n37   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       37 KUMAR pulls up to an EXACT CHANGE TOLL BOOTH. \nKUMAR Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money. KUMAR tosses the change into the basket and waits for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't. \nKUMAR What's going on? It didn't register. (beat) Dude, give me thirty-five more cents. \nHAROLD I don't have anymore change. \nKUMAR Should I just go through? \nHAROLD No.   I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   22. \nKUMAR I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car... \nBIG BURLY GUY Hey!    Move your ass! \nKUMAR (to Harold) I'm going through. \nHAROLD Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door... \nKUMAR Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM. \n42   EXT. MARTIN LUTHER KING BLVD                                  42 The BASKETBALL PLAYERS watch the car speed away. AFTER A \nCOUPLE SECONDS, THEY ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND START \nLAUGHING HYSTERICALLY! A RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER TURNS TO \nTHE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN... \nRANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER Man, you scared the shit out of them! Make that face again! \nHUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Okay, okay, okay... THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN suppresses his laughter and tries to make the face. He bursts out laughing again. \nHUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Shit.   I can't do it. His friends laugh harder.      He tries to regain his composure. \nHUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Hold up.   Hold up... He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before bursting out laughing again. \n43   EXT. HIGHWAY - 9:45 PM                                        43 We see Harold's Infiniti back on the highway, driving fast... \nHAROLD That was close, dude. \n44   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                        44 KUMAR sees a HIGHWAY SIGN-- \"NEW BRUNSWICK-- NEXT EXIT.\" \nKUMAR Rold, check it out!      We're almost there! \nHAROLD Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   26. \nKUMAR Well, prepare to gorge yourself. \n45   EXT. NEW BRUNSWICK EXIT                                     45 We see Harold's Infiniti take the exit... \n46   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (NEW BRUNSWICK) - 9:55 PM              46 Harold's Infiniti drives down a street, loaded with mini- malls and fast food joints... \n47   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                      47 HAROLD and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle... \nHAROLD Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers. \nKUMAR I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries. \nHAROLD God, where the hell is this place? \nKUMAR Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead... \nHAROLD There's the multiplex! \nKUMAR That means the White Castle should be just around the corner... \nHAROLD AND KUMAR'S MOUTHS DROP! INSTEAD OF WHITE CASTLE, \nTHEY SEE A BURGER SHACK. THEY'RE IN TOTAL SHOCK. \nHAROLD What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me! \nKUMAR We gotta get to the bottom of this! \n48   EXT. BURGER SHACK DRIVE THRU - 10:00 PM                     48 KUMAR drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a chubby BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   27. \nBURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE I'm sorry. You have to order at the drive thru menu... \nKUMAR What happened to the White Castle? \nBURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE Excuse me? \nKUMAR There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it? \nBURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE (remembering) Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here. Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger Shack bought this location four years ago. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated. \nKUMAR Please tell me there's another White Castle in town. \nWE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL. \nCLARISSA Ahhhhh! HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.      There is silence for a few seconds until.... \nCHRISTY Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle shits? We see HAROLD quizzically mouth \"battle shits?\" \nCLARISSA Oh my God. We haven't played that since back in camp! HAROLD and KUMAR look confused. \nWE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING \nTHE WATER... \nCHRISTY Wait for it.    Wait for it.    Ahhhhh! \nCLARISSA Hit! HAROLD and Kumar look terrified. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   38. \n55   EXT. DORM COMMON ROOM                                        55 Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming the hallways, looking for Harold. She sees Hippie Asshole walking by, counting Kumar's money... \nCINDY Have you seen a Korean guy around here? \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of them in this dorm. (to himself, but audible) `Tard. Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid. \n56   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                        56 We hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl. \nCLARISSA Hit! We see HAROLD dry heave. We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again. CLARISSA smiles. \nCHRISTY You sank my destroyer! Scag! KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL. \nHAROLD (whispering) Shit! \nTHEY SEE THE MARIJUANA UNPROTECTED FLOATING IN THE TOILET. \nWE THEN HEAR THE MOST DISGUSTING DIARRHEA SOUND YET. \nHAROLD \nI CAN'T TAKE THIS! With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the bathroom. The girls look shocked. \nCHRISTY Who was that? KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom. \nCLARISSA Christy, are you still here? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   39. \nSilence until...We hear a SUPER LOUD FART.    CHRISTY starts laughing. \nCLARISSA Damn!   You sank my battle shit! \n57    EXT. HALLWAY                                                   57 Harold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out.    As they run, they suddenly see-- \n57A   INT. COMMON ROOM                                            57A Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the \"nerdy\" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP. Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES. \nKENNETH Pot brownies for everyone! Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it. Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth... \nCUTE ASIAN CHICK #1 Hey, K-dog!   Can we have some brownies? \nKENNETH To tell you the truth, I'm running low. But a quick titty flash may persuade me. The Korean chicks look at each other. \"Should we?\" \"Okay!\" They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs. \nKUMAR Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER \nSECURITY GUARD (#2)-- \nSECURITY GUARD Hey, you! The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND \nKUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE \nGUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   40. \nFurther down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing. Cindy Kim notices Harold... \nKUMAR Thanks. \n63   INT. CAR - 11:55 PM                                             63 KUMAR gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road... \nHAROLD Do you even know where you're going? \nKUMAR I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon. \nHAROLD We better. It starts to rain... \nHAROLD Shit, now it's raining. \nKUMAR What's the big deal? \nHAROLD Look, I'm completely on edge right now, okay? After all the shit we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take. \nAT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S \nSEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS \nBITING HIS NECK... \nHAROLD \nAHHHHH!!!     FUCK!!!! KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold. \nKUMAR Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR tries to help him. \n64   EXT. DIRT ROAD                                                  64 We see Harold's Infiniti SWERVING BACK AND FORTH. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   43A. \n65   INT. CAR                                                  65 HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF OF HIM. He holds it as far away from his face as possible. The raccoon's arms and legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape. \nKUMAR How the hell did that get in here? \nHAROLD Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003     44. \nKUMAR (looking at Harold's neck) Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine. \nSUDDENLY, THE RACCOON COUGHS UP BLOOD ONTO HAROLD'S SHIRT. \nHAROLD Oh, that's not good! \nHAROLD TURNS THE RACCOON AWAY FROM HIM.          THE RACCOON COUGHS \nUP BLOOD ONTO KUMAR. \nKUMAR Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!! \nKUMAR SWERVES THE CAR IN A PANIC, AS HAROLD OPENS HIS WINDOW. \nKUMAR WATCHES AS HAROLD CHUCKS THE RACCOON OUT THE WINDOW. \nKUMAR Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF \nHEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM! \nHAROLD                                KUMAR Shit!!!                                Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins walking over to them. \nHAROLD Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside... \nGOLDSTEIN What the hell do you think you were doing? You almost killed us! GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR. \nGOLDSTEIN Holy Shit! \nKUMAR Goldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief. \nGOLDSTEIN (to his car) Dude, it's Rold and Kumar! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    45. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    47. \nKUMAR Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT... \nMAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.) Kumar!!! Kumar know that voice all too well... \nKUMAR Shit. \nKUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire. \nHAROLD Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches. \nKUMAR'S FATHER (thick accent) I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I. \nSAIKAT (no accent) What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a beamer. And I get laid whenever I want. You can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school. \nKUMAR Eat my balls, Saikat. \nSAIKAT God, you're 22 years old already! When are you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit? Like your life is so tough. Kumar doesn't have a response.   Saikat's right. \nKUMAR'S FATHER I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you. \n(MORE) \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003      48. KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd) If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off! \nKUMAR Oh, come on, dad! \nKUMAR'S FATHER \"Daddy will not be coming on anything!\" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place. \nKUMAR You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug. \nKUMAR It won't happen again. \nKUMAR'S FATHER Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned... \nHAROLD Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh? \nKUMAR Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money! \nHAROLD (extremely confused) But...you just hugged him... \nKUMAR I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS. \nKUMAR Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   49. \n74A   INT. DOCTOR'S LOUNGE                                       74A Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on... \nKUMAR Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this. \n75    INT. HALLWAY                                                75 HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway... \nHAROLD If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea. \nKUMAR We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy feely). \nMALE NURSE Dr. Patel, thank God I found you!    I need your help immediately! The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room... \n76    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM                                         76 The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient... \nHAROLD (whispering to Kumar) What the hell's going on here? \nKUMAR He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   50. \nMALE NURSE The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen. No exit wounds. HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest. \nHAROLD Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!! \nTHE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD. \nKUMAR Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you \"this is a sign.\" \nHAROLD Stop it. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   54. \nKUMAR Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way... \nHAROLD Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN. \nHAROLD What are you doing?! \nKUMAR (calling out) Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN \nREACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR \nSTARTS PEELING OUT... \nKUMAR Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then, \nTHE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY... \nKUMAR (looking up) Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING \nDOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL. KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill. Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD. \nHAROLD You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now! \nKUMAR Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road! \nHAROLD I told you I didn't want to speak to her! (composing himself) Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     55. \nKUMAR Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a \"POP!\"   Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated. \n79   EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM                               79 HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site. \nHAROLD Godammit. You know how to change a flat? \nKUMAR Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing. \nHAROLD Where's my spare tire? \nKUMAR I don't know. \nHAROLD Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers... \nKUMAR Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float? \nHAROLD What bridge? What the hell are you talking about? \nKUMAR (realizing) Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad. \nHAROLD Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   56. \nIt's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him. \nUGLY MAN You boys need some help? The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP). HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out. \n80   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:20 AM                                    80 The UGLY MAN'S TRUCK tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road. \n81   INT. TRUCK                                                  81 The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them. \nHAROLD Thanks for helping us out. \nFREAK SHOW No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, \"what would Jesus do?\" Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard... \nFREAK SHOW So, you boys worship Christ? The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond. \nHAROLD                           KUMAR Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great. \nLIANE (a little offended) Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time? \nHAROLD No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy. \nHAROLD Nevermind. (to Kumar, swinging his hand) Okay, rock, paper, scissors... \nLIANE Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time. \nHAROLD Huh? \nLIANE Come on.   Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused. \nKUMAR I'm not sure we quite understand... \nLIANE I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE... \nKUMAR Um, are we talking about one hole or two? \nLIANE However you want to do it. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   61. \nHAROLD Sorry, no thank you. \nKUMAR (to Harold) Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. (beat) Shotgun anus! \nHAROLD Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation... \nKUMAR What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!? \nLIANE Well...okay. (to Harold) Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts. \nLIANE (to Harold, re: breasts) Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane... \nHAROLD Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON... \nFREAK SHOW Hey boys-- I changed your tire... FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE... \nFREAK SHOW What the hell are you doing with my wife! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    62. \nHAROLD (scared shitless) Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar! \nFREAK SHOW I most certainly did not say that! \nKUMAR No.   You did. We both heard you. \nFREAK SHOW (calming down) Are you sure? \nKUMAR Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this. \nFREAK SHOW Oh...my mistake then. \nKUMAR No problem. \nFREAK SHOW Well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome? \nFREAK SHOW PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND \nHAROLD AND KUMAR... \nFREAK SHOW Who wants the first reach-around? \n84   EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE                                      84 HAROLD and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can. \n85   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:45 AM                                     85 Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods. \n86   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       86 \nKUMAR Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened. \nHAROLD Agreed. \nHAROLD (upset) Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them... \n90   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                        90 HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    66. \nINDIAN CASHIER (to Cole and the punks) Please...the pies...do not... Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then approach the Indian Cashier... \nHAROLD Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders. \nKUMAR (to Harold) He probably can't speak English... \nKUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It sounds like it's very complicated. Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store. Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK... \nKUMAR Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS... \nHAROLD (to Kumar) Huh?   Oh, good. \nCOLE (O.S.) \nEXTREME KAYAKING!!! HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY \nTHE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH \nTHE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR... In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid- air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS, \nGLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC. The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003    67. \nThe kayak lands on the floor.     COLE gets out and celebrates with his friends. \nCOLE That was so fucking extreme, man! \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine point five. Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers. The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI. Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS. He goes   apeshit over his find. \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme Cheddar! He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place. The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the Cashier... \nCOLE Extreme Cashier!!! Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER around and around. \nHAROLD Somebody should do something. \nKUMAR (to Cole) Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something. \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNKS Oooooooooh! Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get their asses kicked. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   68. \nHAROLD (to Kumar) I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling... \nKUMAR (pissed off at himself) Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing. \nCOLE Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking with me one more time. Just try it! Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest. \nKUMAR (to Kumar, embarrassed) Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating. \nCOLE (like Apu) Thank you, come again! \n91   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE                           91 HAROLD and KUMAR walk back towards their car... \nHAROLD Kumar-- you okay? \nKUMAR Yeah, I just hate those dicks. (beat) Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry... \nSUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START.    HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP \nWALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   69. \nTHEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY \nWATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES \nKUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) Wait. Hold on. \n(MORE) \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003     72. KUMAR (cont'd) How can you give him a ticket for jaywalking? I mean, look at this street! He wasn't causing traffic or anything! \nHAROLD Kumar, shut up... \nOFFICER PALUMBO (to Kumar) Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass. \nKUMAR Bust my ass?! \nOFFICER PALUMBO Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass. (to Harold) What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit. What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim... Harold points to his ID. \nHAROLD Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo. \nOFFICER PALUMBO Yes. Harold. That's a great name.    You should be proud of that name, son. \nHAROLD Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away. \nOFFICER PALUMBO As you were, ladies. Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it. \nKUMAR 220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys. \nHAROLD Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't... \nKUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) No, no, no. I understand what's going on. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   73. \nHarold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him. \nOFFICER PALUMBO Hey, hands down! No sudden moves! Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses. \nKUMAR Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, \"How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!\" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo. \nKUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!! \nHAROLD Oh shit. \n92   INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM                                    92 The CELL DOOR SLAMS.    Harold is behind bars. \nHAROLD (calling out) Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check. \nOFFICER PALUMBO Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     74. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again. \nOFFICER PALUMBO Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the talk we had, right Brad? Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE (shaken) Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars... \nHAROLD Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio... \nRADIO   ANNOUNCER The search for the   escaped cheetah continues tonight.   It was last spotted in Randolph Township,   heading South... Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold sits down, across from Tarik. While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it. \nHAROLD So what are you in here for? \nTARIK For being black. \nHAROLD Come on.   Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   75. \nTARIK I am serious. You wanna know what happened? Harold nods. \nTARIK I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right? Harold shrugs his shoulders. \nTARIK Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, \"Hey, I'm not resisting anything.\" So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting. \nHAROLD Holy shit.   What did you do? \nHAROLD How the hell should I know? \nKUMAR (O.C.) This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE \nVENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT \nONTO THE GROUND... \nHAROLD Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head. \nKUMAR Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell. \nKUMAR You sure you don't want to get out? \nHAROLD And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop. \nKUMAR So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second. \nHAROLD Fine.    Hurry up. Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    79. \n95   EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS                            95 We see ALL THE POLICE CARS RETURNING TO THE STATION. \n96   INT. POLICE STATION                                         96 Kumar finds A BIG METAL KEY RING on Palumbo's desk... \nKUMAR Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will... \nHAROLD Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something... \nKUMAR What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk. \nHAROLD Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n97   EXT. PARK (SWINGSET) - DAY                                  97 It's a beautiful, sunny day in the park, as KUMAR pushes THE BAG OF WEED on a swing, like young lovers do in movies... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n98   INT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - NIGHT                          98 KUMAR has his arms around THE BAG OF WEED as he helps it swing the golf club. It's a hole in one!

HIP STREET - NIGHT                                     99 Kumar and THE BAG OF WEED are sitting down, posing for a CARICATURE SKETCH ARTIST. The Artist reveals his sketch to Kumar and The Bag of Weed. It obviously looks ridiculous. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    80. \n100    INT.

ALLEY - DAY                                           102 THE BAG OF WEED is holding a box containing pictures and memorabilia of it's relationship to the HIPPIE ASSHOLE. The Bag of Weed throws the box in a GARBAGE CAN. Kumar lights a match and throws it in the can, setting it aflame. He and the bag of weed face each other and kiss... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n102A   INT. KUMAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              102A A NAKED KUMAR and THE BAG OF WEED are kissing in bed. The BAG OF WEED starts to go under the covers. We watch, as the sheets move up and down. KUMAR STARTS TO HAVE AN ORGASM... THE BAG OF WEED comes up from under the covers. Kumar gives it a kiss. THEN, HE GOES UNDER THE COVERS. We see THE BAG \nOF WEED START TO TREMBLE AND SHUDDER IN ECSTASY... \n103    INT. KITCHEN TABLE - AFTERNOON                             103 KUMAR (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF \nCOFFEE. IT GIVES KUMAR THE COFFEE. KUMAR TAKES A SIP. IT'S \nTOO COLD. HE SPITS IT OUT AND SLAPS THE BAG OF WEED... \nDEPRESSED, THE BAG OF WEED WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE... KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room.   He obviously feels guilty... \nKUMAR Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON \nWHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA. \nHAROLD (eyes closed, screaming) \nHE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME! HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS. Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    84. \nTHE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD.    HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY \nTHAT HAROLD HAD IN HIS PANTS. \nKUMAR (annoyed) I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship. \nHAROLD He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up... \nKUMAR Dude, I think I have an idea. \nHAROLD What is it? \nKUMAR I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke coming up from below. Pan back down... \n107   OMIT                                                        107 \n108   EXT.

Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck like reigns on a horse. \nHAROLD Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna ride this cheetah? \nKUMAR Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away. \nHAROLD This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    85. \nKUMAR Well, we'll soon find out. (like to a snow dog) Mush! Mush! \nSUDDENLY, THE CHEETAH DARTS OUT LIKE LIGHTENING WITH HAROLD \nAND KUMAR ON IT'S BACK. EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO \nSENSE, WE SEE THE CHEETAH ZOOMING PAST STREETS AND FORESTS. \nHAROLD AND KUMAR ARE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN AS IT RACES ACROSS \nA MAJOR HIGHWAY... \nHAROLD Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?! \nKUMAR Both! \nHAROLD This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no... \nSMACK! A BRANCH HITS HAROLD IN THE FACE, KNOCKING HIM OFF THE CHEETAH. Harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding. His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n109   EXT. THE LAND OF BURGERS - DAY                              109 THE LAND OF BURGERS is an OZ-like world-- the entire terrain, with all it's rolling hills, IS MADE UP OF HAMBURGERS. Music plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip through THE LAND OF BURGERS, holding hands. Along the way, they run by... The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with each other, in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY gives Harold the same scary look from before.... FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with. KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy. Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill, UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into each other's eyes... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   86. \nMARIA I love you, Harold. \nHAROLD I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her. Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE \nFRENCH FRIES FROM THE BRANCH AND FEEDS THEM TO HAROLD. \nCOLE (O.S.) Wow, you guys are really extreme... HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM... \nCOLE ...extremely gay that is. \nSUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD \nPASSING A JOINT AROUND. \nONE OF THE STRIPPERS LIES ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT WITH HER ASS \nIN FRONT OF NEIL. ANOTHER STRIPPER POURS A LINE OF COCAINE ON \nTHAT STRIPPER'S ASS. NEIL SNORTS THE COCAINE FROM THE \nSTRIPPER'S ASS!!! \n112   EXT.

They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off. Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he shouldn't push Harold any further. \nKUMAR Fine...We'll find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office. Harold, furious and almost in tears, simply nods \"yes.\" \nCUT TO: \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   89. \n112A   EXT. DIRT ROAD                                              112A Kumar, disappointed, walks down the road with a miserable Harold. When they reach the corner... \nKUMAR (pointing) Look, there's a Krispee Kreme.     We'll call from there. \n113    EXT. KRISPEE KREME DONUTS                                    113 Harold and Kumar walk over to the parking lot. Unfortunately, they notice a familiar YELLOW JEEP COVERED IN STICKERS. \nKUMAR Oh great.     Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby. \nCOLE (O.S.) (to Kumar) Hey Apu! COLE laughs.   Kumar tries to ignore him... \nCOLE Who's running the Quik-E-Mart while you're gone? COLE pounds fists with his friends. \nKUMAR (to Rold) Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points... \nHAROLD Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   90. \nHAROLD (yearning) I want that. \nKUMAR What?    A chocolate cream filled? \nHAROLD No.  I want that feeling. (beat) The feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires. (beat) I NEED that feeling. \nKUMAR Are you saying what I think you're saying? \nHAROLD We gotta go to White Castle. KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug. \nKUMAR Yes!    I knew you had it in you! Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table... \nKUMAR Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are \"an item.\" \nKUMAR You should have boned her when you had the chance. Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold. \nHAROLD (to Cole) Hey, why don't you just leave us alone? \nCOLE Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it, Mr. Miagi? Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID... Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   91. \nHAROLD Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a \"pussy\" Harold is. \nKUMAR (pissed off, but powerless) Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit! \nHAROLD (totally calm) Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a \"What the fuck is he talking about?\" look. \nHAROLD Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my lead... \nKUMAR Your lead? Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows. \nSUDDENLY, HAROLD SNATCHES COLE'S KEYS FROM THE HOOD OF THE \nJEEP AND RUSHES INSIDE THE DRIVER'S SIDE. One of the Extreme Sports Punks sees Harold doing this... \nEXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Hey, Cole!   Look! Cole turns to see Harold in his car. Kumar is about to get in the passenger's side. Cole and the Punks start running towards the car! Kumar sees this and quickly gets inside. HAROLD puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks. \nKUMAR Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them. \n128   INT.

COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     131 HAROLD looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal. \nKUMAR What are you doing?! \nHAROLD I'm not going back to jail!     We've come too far! Now buckle up. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   95. \nKUMAR Buckle up? Kumar buckles his seat belt.   HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN... \n132   EXT. CHERRY HILL ROAD                                      132 The YELLOW JEEP goes around a turn in the road and then CUTS \nINTO THE FOREST, DISAPPEARING IN THE WOODS... We then see the COP CAR go around the turn. It passes by the point where HAROLD and KUMAR entered the forest. \n133   INT. COP CAR                                               133 From OFFICER BRUCKS'S POV, we see that he has a long stretch ahead, with no cars in sight. \nOFFICER BRUCKS What the hell? He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a screeching halt. OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering where the YELLOW JEEP went.

We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be... \nTHEY NOTICE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE OVER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF. \nHAROLD                             KUMAR Shit!

Harold and Kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the cliff and look down. IT'S A VERY STEEP DROP. \nSUDDENLY, KUMAR SEES SOMETHING OUT IN THE DISTANCE... \nKUMAR (pointing) Rold! Look out there! \nHAROLD LOOKS TO WHERE KUMAR IS POINTING-- IT'S A WHITE CASTLE \nWAY DOWN BELOW, ABOUT A MILE AWAY. \nTHEY THEN HEAR A POLICE SIREN COMING FROM BACK IN THE WOODS. \nHAROLD Oh shit!   We're trapped! Kumar notices something... \nKUMAR Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER... \nHAROLD No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather turn myself in than die. \nKUMAR Do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car? \nNEIL I know. It was a dick move on my part. That's why I'm paying for your meal. Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved. \nHAROLD Thanks, I guess. NEIL hands them some cash... \nNEIL Here's fifty for the meal, and two hundred for the car. \nHAROLD (concerned) What happened to the car? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   104. \nNEIL I made some love stains in the back seat. You'll see. Anyway, take it easy guys. I'll see you around. \nHAROLD Where are you going? \nNEIL Wherever God takes me. With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant.   HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, confused. \nTEENAGER Hey guys...it's gonna take a little while to make all those burgers. You might as well sit down. HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat. \nKUMAR Dude, we're here. Isn't it great? \nHAROLD I know. I can't believe we made it. AND we got the car back! If we can just get out of here in a half hour, I can get back to my office and get the work done. \nKUMAR Hey, look! KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.

I'm sorry, but did you just call me \"cock boy?\" \nHAROLD Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback. \nJ.D. Oh, I'm not quick enough?

KUMAR notices that Harold has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder... \nKUMAR What the hell are you bringing that for? Harold hands Kumar his keys. \nHAROLD You're driving. I'm gonna try to get some of my work done in the car. Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty. \nKUMAR Shit, I forgot my cell phone. \nHAROLD Why don't you just run back and get it? \nKUMAR (thinks for a moment) Nah, we've gone too far. Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door. \"Bing!\" The elevator door opens and the guys enter. \n25   INT. ELEVATOR                                                25 As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a DOOR SLAM behind them. They turn around and see MARIA locking her door. She hasn't noticed Harold and Kumar yet. \nKUMAR Hey, there's your girlfriend. You actually gonna talk to her this time? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   19. \nHarold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the \"door closed\" button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them. \nKUMAR What the hell are you doing? That was a perfect opportunity! You could have asked her if she wanted to go to White Castle. Harold doesn't say anything.   He looks down in shame. \nKUMAR You're worthless. \nHAROLD I'm not worthwhile. \n26    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY)                             26 Harold and Kumar exit the elevator... \nKUMAR Dude, it's only awkward because you're a pussy. Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore... \nHAROLD It doesn't matter. The only girls interested in me are girls I have no interest in. Like Cindy Kim. \nKUMAR Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier. One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight. \nHAROLD God, she invites me to everything. \n", "test1_id": 3000, "test2_input": "CINDY I'm so glad you showed up, Harold! \nHAROLD (unenthusiastic) Yeah. Me too. \nCINDY Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued to the envelope I sent you? \nHAROLD Uh, yeah.    They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. \"Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?\" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while... \nHAROLD (to Kenneth) Uh, yes? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   31. \nKENNETH Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan? \nHAROLD Yeah, I'm a junior analyst. \nKENNETH Awesome! KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him. He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes... \nHAROLD Yes? \nKENNETH Uh, this is actually a two-part question. I'm applying for a summer internship at Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a) what it's like being an investment banker and b) if you would write me a recommendation. \nHAROLD What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students. He can't bear to tell them the truth... \nHAROLD ...awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other. \nHAROLD As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch... \nCINDY Actually Harold, we should be getting to the party. We can discuss all this stuff there. It's just down the hall. All the Asian students get up... \nHAROLD Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   32. \nCINDY You'll see him when we're done. Trust me, you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae. Kenneth looks proud of himself. \nHAROLD Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away. \n52    INT. DORM HALLWAY - 11:15 PM                                 52 KUMAR is standing in the hallway, accosting random students. He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by... \nKUMAR Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated... \nKUMAR What kind of Ivy League school is this? \n52A   EXT. PRINCETON DORM - 11:16 PM                             52A Kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking random students for drugs. Eventually, a HIPPIE-LOOKING STUDENT (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps KUMAR on the back. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up? KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief... \nKUMAR Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck... \nKUMAR Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away... \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE Yo, man!   Not cool! This is my baby, man! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     33. \nHippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a measly dime bag... \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE That'll be eighty bucks. \nKUMAR Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it. That's cool with me. I can find lots of people who want to get high. I can smoke it myself, man. \nKUMAR Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you? \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude. Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE (laughing like a prick) Dumbass. Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making their deal. \nCHRISTY Hey, you guys about to smoke? KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.   They're both floored by their hotness. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE (to the Twins) Yeah. Wanna come back to my place? \n", "test2_true": "(MORE) \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003    34. KUMAR (cont'd) (to the Twins, showing his bag of weed) Ladies? Wanna get high and have some fun? CHRISTY and CLARISSA look at each other. They like this dude. \nCHRISTY                           CLARISSA Sure!                           Sure! \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE (butting in) Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually quite good. The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not part of the crowd. \nCHRISTY (re: bag of food) We're just gonna eat before this gets cold. What do you say we meet you back in our room in twenty minutes? \nCLARISSA We're in room 109. \nKUMAR 109.   Got it. I'll see you later. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE Yeah, see you there. THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off. \nHIPPIE ASSHOLE Not cool, man. \n52B   INT. DORM HALLWAY                                        52B Kumar runs down the hall and finds HAROLD walking with CINDY and the ASIAN STUDENTS. He runs over to them... \nKUMAR Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick! There are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us. KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words. \nKUMAR Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely, young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   35. \nCINDY Sorry.    Harold's coming with us. \nKUMAR That's bullshit. He's coming with me. Isn't that right, Rold? CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her. \nHAROLD (to Kumar) Let's go to the party for a little while. \nKUMAR Fuck that! KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room, and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy... \nKUMAR Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You can do whatever you want with him. (to Harold) Let's go. KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her. \n53   INT. DORM HALLWAY (DIFFERENT WING) - 11:30 PM                53 KUMAR takes the first puff of a joint. \nKUMAR I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club. You know what their parties are like. \nHAROLD Look, what do you want me to say?     I was under pressure. \nKUMAR Just say \"no\"! That's all it takes.      Now take a hit of this. Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and KUMAR with drugs. \nSECURITY GUARD Hey, what are you two doing?! HAROLD and KUMAR start running down the hallway. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     36. \nSECURITY GUARD Hey, get back here! HAROLD and KUMAR duck around the corner.     They see a door to the WOMEN'S BATHROOM. \nKUMAR Quick.    In here. The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM. \n54   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                          54 HAROLD and KUMAR try to decide where to hide. \nHAROLD Shit!    What if he finds us? \nKUMAR Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for us in the women's bathroom. Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom. \nKUMAR Shit!    Get in that stall! There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER TWO and shuts the door behind him. The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.    Harold's laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar. CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.       They're in mid-conversation. \nCHRISTY Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with that cute Indian bloke. \nINTERCUT: IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD and KUMAR both standing on the toilet bowl. From Kumar's POV, he sees CHRISTY and CLARISSA through the crack of the door. \nCLARISSA It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have the worst case of the taco shits. KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES      MAY 28 2003   37. \nHAROLD (whispering) Ew...gross. CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to look over at that stall. \nCHRISTY Oh great.   Now I think I have to go. CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door. The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at each other grossed out. From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls. \n", "test2_id": 3001, "test3_input": "HAROLD Oh my God!    Oh my God!

He looks inside... \nOFFICER BRUCKS (to the walkie-talkie) It appears they've escaped. They ditched their jeep. OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop would taste cocaine during a bust. \nOFFICER BRUCKS (to the walkie-talkie) Good news. I found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years. Looks like they've terrorized their last convenience store. Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks again at the bag. Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in love... \n140A   EXT. OLD PICK UP TRUCK - DAY (FANTASY)                       140A OFFICER BRUCKS and the BAG OF WEED drink bottles of BUDWEISER while sitting in the back of a PICKUP TRUCK. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    100. \n140B   EXT.

MID-AIR - 6:50 AM                                       141 Our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky. Harold and Kumar look down as they soar above the trees... \nHAROLD Dude, we're so high right now. \nKUMAR We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while... \nHAROLD Hey, Kumar? \nKUMAR Yeah? \nHAROLD How are we gonna get down? \nKUMAR Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point. \nHAROLD That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground. \nHAROLD Is it a problem if we fly into birds? \nKUMAR Why do you ask? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    101. \nHAROLD Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING \nSTRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM. \nKUMAR Oh shit! HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds collide with their faces... \nHAROLD Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes! \nTHE BIRDS CAUSE THE HANG-GLIDER TO GO AGAINST THE WIND, \nSENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR DOWN FAST. THEY ARE SCREAMING AND \nYELLING AS THEY PLUMMET... \nKUMAR We're gonna die! We're gonna die! \nHAROLD I hate you!   I hate you so much! \nTHE HANG-GLIDER FALLS STRAIGHT INTO A TREE AND GETS CAUGHT IN \nTHE BRANCHES. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SAVED. \nKUMAR We're gonna live! Ha! Ha! We're gonna live!

Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them. They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER STANDING... \nTEENAGER Looks like you guys had some night, huh? Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the teenager. Their expressions are stone cold... \nHAROLD I want thirty slyders. I want five french fries. I want four large Cherry cokes. \nKUMAR Same.    Only make mine Diet Cokes. \nTEENAGER Wow. That comes to...forty-two dollars and seventy-five cents. HAROLD and KUMAR take out their WALLETS.     THEY OPEN THEM UP. \nTHE WALLETS ARE EMPTY! \nHAROLD Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?! \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   103. \nKUMAR You don't have money?!

It made me start craving it too. \nHAROLD Where's my fucking car you prick! \nNEIL Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I was tripping balls last night. I don't know what came over me.

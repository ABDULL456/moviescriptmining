HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING                  11B Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building... Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators. HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl. Harold takes a deep breath... \nHAROLD Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous. \n11C   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY                       11C Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They give each other a friendly smile.

ELEVATOR                                                12 HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak... \nHAROLD So Maria, what's been going on? \nMARIA Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week. How about you? \nHAROLD My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change. \nMARIA Really? \nHAROLD (deadpan) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And the guy next to me still smells like crap. But a man can dream, right? \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   9. \nMaria laughs.   Harold's pleased that his joke worked. \nHAROLD So what are you up to tonight? \nMARIA Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a little bit, clean up the apartment, and then go over to my boyfriend's place. He's cooking me a really nice dinner. \nHAROLD (disappointed) Really? \nMARIA (smiling) Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of that. (beat) I'll actually probably just sit on my ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch Blind Date. \nHAROLD (playful) That sounds awful. Harold laughs, as does Maria.

HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM                  16 Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of \"BILLY MADISON.\" \nHAROLD Kumar? \nKUMAR (O.C.) Yeah, I'm in here! Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar is not in the room, however. \nHAROLD Kumar? \nKUMAR (O.C.) In here... Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a \"clipping sound\" coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. Harold walks inside... \nHAROLD Kumar, what the hell are you doing! \n", "test1_true": "HAROLD Why aren't you doing this in your room! \nKUMAR The mirror's in here.

It makes my Johnson look bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll end up with pubes like my dad. You've seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right? HAROLD notices something... \nHAROLD Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I trim my nose hair with those! \nKUMAR Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months. \nHAROLD \nGET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM! Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM.

HAROLD'S BEDROOM                                        17 Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working. \nHAROLD (calling out) One of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight. Kumar walks back into Harold's room... \nKUMAR I assume you gave him the appropriate \"go fuck yourself.\" \nHAROLD If by \"go fuck yourself\" you mean \"no problem sir\" then yes, he got the message loud and clear. KUMAR shakes his head in disgust... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   12. \nKUMAR Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say \"no\" once in a while. Now lets get high. \nHAROLD No.   I got a lot of work to finish. Kumar shuts Harold's laptop. \nKUMAR Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to get that shit done later. Come on, let's smoke a couple joints. Harold thinks for a moment and then caves... \nHAROLD One joint. \nKUMAR One and a half. Now let's do this... Kumar exits the room... HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs. \n18   INT. LIVING ROOM                                           18 Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover-- inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana. Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy. The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up. \nMAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (on the answering machine) Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your interview today was good. I'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late! Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T. book and starts rolling a fat blunt... \nMAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT It is very important you show up on time! Mommy and I will be very upset if you do not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye. \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    13. \nHarold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now untucked) enters the living room.

It's not like there's a shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor. Just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean I have to. \nHAROLD Well, then what are you going to do? \nKUMAR I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off. Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look.

Here we go again. COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby. \nCOLE (O.S.) (to Kumar) Hey Apu! COLE laughs.   Kumar tries to ignore him... \nCOLE Who's running the Quik-E-Mart while you're gone? COLE pounds fists with his friends. \nKUMAR (to Rold) Fucking asshole. Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and points... \nHAROLD Look! Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside, sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down... Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT. HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   90. \nHAROLD (yearning) I want that. \nKUMAR What?

Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table... \nKUMAR Is that Cindy Kim? Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein. Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are \"an item.\" \nKUMAR You should have boned her when you had the chance.

What are you gonna do about it, Mr. Miagi? Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID... Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh... \nDOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   91. \nHAROLD Nothing. Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the Punks are laughing about what a \"pussy\" Harold is. \nKUMAR (pissed off, but powerless) Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit! \nHAROLD (totally calm) Don't worry. The universe tends to unfold as it should. Kumar gives a \"What the fuck is he talking about?\" look. \nHAROLD Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my lead... \nKUMAR Your lead?

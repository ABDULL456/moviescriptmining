JULIAN Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die... He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door 
OPENS - - but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe. Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon backs away into the room. 
GORDON Easy... Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed at Gordon's head. Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot. 
JULIAN Where's is she? 
GORDON She's gone... Picked up Billy's body... She's gone home. Finally Julian lowers the shotgun. 
GORDON (CONT'D) Didn't she tell you? Julian sits down. 
GORDON (CONT'D) You alright mate? D'you want something? Julian mumbles to himself... then turns to Gordon. Realisation dawning on him: 
JULIAN I'm so fucked...

CUT TO: 
INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK - DAY 
Gordon and Julian walk towards Gordon's car, the sounds of their footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls. Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian heads for the passenger's side. Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian, talking across the roof of the car. 
GORDON We're good mates aren't we? Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious... 
JULIAN ... Yeah. 
GORDON I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish there was another way... Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head. 
JULIAN What did she say? What did she promise you? 
GORDON Don't make this harder-- GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms. Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow. 
GORDON (CONT'D) You've become a liability. You can see that, can't you? Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt. It clatters to the floor. 
GORDON (CONT'D) And now she wants me to take over. She wants me to be the favoured son. What am I supposed to say? Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun. He's got seconds... 
GORDON (CONT'D) I didn't want it to end like this. First I fuck your mother. Then I-- Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest. The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far wall of the car park. Dead instantly. Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse, appalled by the turn of events...

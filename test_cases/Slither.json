{"train": "SLITHER \nwritten by \nJames Gunn \nSeptember 10, 2004 \nFADE IN: \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nCLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard, in teacherly cursive. \nWe PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing out, \"SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\" \nStarla glances at the classroom of high school students. She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking, but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the class. \nSTARLA When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait -- he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment. \nThe boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks. KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits him. He CHUCKLES. \nSTARLA We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. But we're neophytes. We've been around two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350 million. You tell me who's the more successful species. \nA BOY raises his hand. \nSTARLA Will. \nWILL How's all this go with how the Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs? \nSome of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about to answer, when the BELL RINGS. \nSTARLA We'll tackle that tomorrow... Everyone bring your boxing gloves. \nThe kids start to leave. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nCelebratory banners are strung over this street, including one that reads: \"DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!\" We're in the center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups. \nMEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose. \nJACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack jams on his HORN. \nJACK Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker! \nJack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the sidewalk, listening and staring in shock. \nMOTHER Mornin', Mayor. \nJack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something up in the sky. \nHe looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nStudents file out of the open door for the day. Kylie, Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND are looking up at the falling meteor. \nKYLIE Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay. \nEXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY \nA RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the treetops of a nearby forest. \nINT. GRANT'S OFFICE - DAY \nA framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth. \nGRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties, notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP. Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking relieved they didn't drop it. \nGRANT Just a tremor, boys. \nGrant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders with a Sharpie. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nFour cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,   relaxed, and handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop, TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station parking lot. They CHUCKLE. \nTREVOR Did ya' feel that?! \nThey enter the station. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nSECRETARY 'Night, Mr. Grant. \nGRANT See ya', Ashley. \nGrant walks across the workshop toward the door. He sees a crowd of WORKERS lounging around a glass-cutting table, LAUGHING at something. \nSome of them nod at Grant, and he nods back.   But he's completely outside their circle. \nEXT. GRANT HOUSE - NIGHT \nA sizable two-story suburban home.    All the lights are off but one. \nGRANT (O.S.) So I get home today, phone's ringing. It's Hank Wilcox. \nINT. GRANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nStarla and Grant eat dinner in this well-decorated room. As Grant chatters, Starla occasionally smiles politely at him. \nGRANT Callin' for you. What the hell? I said, 'Hank, that's a little bit outta line don't'cha think, a single man callin' someone's wife?' At night, nonetheless. \nStarla is quiet, almost afraid: \nSTARLA He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester. \nGRANT Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy. \nSTARLA It's just a work thing. \nGRANT Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks. \nGrant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth. \nGRANT I'll tell you, sugarplum, you're lucky you got me. You're too damn trusting. Without me to protect you, you'd get kilt one of these days. \nStarla nods. \nINT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER \nStarla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling. \nGRANT (O.S.) Sugarplum, you coming into bed? \nStarla turns toward the door.       She doesn't say anything for a moment. \nSTARLA Just a second. \nStarla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom. \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nGrant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him. It's almost completely dark in here. \nGrant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without grace. \nAfter doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push him off her. \nSTARLA Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. \nGrant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. \nGRANT Come on, baby, it's -- \nSTARLA I'm sorry.   I don't just have some switch. \nGRANT Sure you do. \nThrough Starla's nightgown, Grant pretends to flick one of her nipples. \nGRANT Flip. \nThen the other. \nGRANT Flip. \nSTARLA That's disrespectful. \nGrant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid. \nGRANT When are you in the mood, exactly? Seems to me that mood's as rare as winnin' the Goddamn lotto. \nGrant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting them on. \nSTARLA Where are you going? \nHe comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in closer. \nA gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina. \nGRANT What the...? \nGrant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even frightened. He looks around for someone else. \nGRANT Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo? \nNo one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure. He picks up a tree branch. \nGrant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of the branch. \nNothing happens. \nHe does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges toward Grant. \nGrand pokes it again. \nA small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as well. \nGrant slowly bends down to look at it when -- \nThe SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the stomach. \nGRANT Ow!   Fuck! \nGrant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears inside him. \nHe clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back into the colorful flowers. His body convulses. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nCAT SCAN SHOT - INT. GRANT'S BODY \nWe see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half. We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up through his body, and into his neck. \nThe spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY. \nBACK TO SCENE \nGrant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse. \nA hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for the source of the screams. The man looks down at the frozen Grant. \nCAMPER Over here! \nThe Camper crouches down beside him. \nCAMPER Hey, man. You all right?... Dude?... Oh shit. \nThe Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend. \nCAMPER I think he's d -- \nGrant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man, like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to speak, but hardly can -- \nGRANT It's taking... my... brain. \nCAMPER Buddy? \nGrant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands. \nCAMPER You all right, man? \nGrant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns and stumbles away from them, out of the forest. \nCAMPER That might of been a stroke, buddy. You better take it easy. \nINT. GRANT'S PICKUP - DAWN \nGrant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck, sweating and blinking rapidly. \nEXT. GRANT HOUSE - MORNING \nGrant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he hears -- \nNEIGHBOR (O.S.) Hey ya', Grant. \nGrant swings his head toward his NEIGHBOR, who is taking a happy BEAGLE for a morning walk. \nNEIGHBOR What were ya', night-fishing again? You catch anything? \nJANENE Oh! You got that fresh-fucked glow, don't you? \nSTARLA Janene. \nJANENE You slut. \nSTARLA Hush. \nJANENE No shame.   You're a married woman. \nSTARLA He was... considerate. Maybe this is the start of a real change in Grant. \nINT. GRANT BATHROOM - DAY \nGrant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso. The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout. A pus oozes out. \nGrant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound. \nINT.   GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nGrant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese. \nHe opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts. He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is. \nMOMENTS LATER \nGrant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on. But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower. \nHe looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better. He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts. \nGRANT Meat. \nAfter contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and carries off the pile of meat. \nINT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nGrant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER. He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around. \nGrant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens another. It has manila file folders, but no files. \nGrant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write out \"BALONEY\" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney into the folder and files it away. \nHe starts writing out \"PASTRAMI\". \nLATER \nGrant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from \"BALONEY\" through \"TURKEY.\" But he doesn't look satisfied. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - LATER \nGrant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping cart. He peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows of steaks, pork chops, and so on. \nGRANT Meat. \nBUTCHER Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend? \nGrant snaps out of his reverie. \nGRANT Sure thing, killer. \nBUTCHER What can I do you for? \nGRANT Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes. \nBUTCHER How many you need? \nGrant stares at the steaks. \nGRANT Well... having us a little dinner party... I'd say... eight. No, no... fourteen... \nThe Butcher nods, starts to grab steaks.   Grant CHUCKLES. \nGRANT Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here? \nBUTCHER All the rib eyes? \nGRANT Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?... \nEXT. GRANT HOME - LATER \nGrant backs his pickup toward the garage. Meat is piled into the bed. Wrapped packages of meat fill the seats around him. \nINT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nEXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING \nStarla walks to get the paper in her robe, and she sees a BOY, aged thirteen or so, stapling a LOST: REWARD flyer to a telephone pole, with a picture of the beagle. \nSTARLA Roscoe's gone? \nThe Boy's face is streaked from a long night of crying. \nBOY You haven't seen him, have you? \nStarla shakes her head. \nSTARLA I'm sure he'll show up, Tim. \nThe Boy nods, and walks to the next telephone pole to put up another flyer. \nEXT. SHADED FOREST - DAY \nGrant moves up a hill, between trees, looking around for something. He comes to a stop, trying to remember which way to go. He does, and moves on. \nEXT.   OLD BARN - LATER \nGrant comes upon an old wooden barn. The structure is maybe a hundred years old, and long abandoned. It's spattered with graffiti. Grant stares at it. \nMOMENTS LATER \nGrant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms. \nINT.   OLD BARN - LATER \nGrant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn. He arranges it, fluffs it there. His actions are very animal-like when no one's around. He seems to be making a nest. He sits back, looks at it. \nHe's happy. \nFADE TO: \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStarla, dressed in her weekend finery, is looking in the mirror above her dresser, and putting on earrings. \nSTARLA Grant, are you almost ready? \nINT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nGrant looks ill. He is leaning over the sink, sweating, clutching his stomach. \nGRANT Yeah, hon, I'll be right there! \nGrant turns and pushes open his door. \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrant sees Starla sitting on the edge of the bed, her back to him, as she puts on her nylons. She doesn't know he's there. \nGrant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward her, stalking her. \nSomething starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach, like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's back. \nGrant looks at the nape of Starla's neck.    Her delicate ear. He becomes confused; he softens. \nStarla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from her. He's trying to push the tubule back down. \nSTARLA What are you doing? \nGRANT You're pretty. \nStarla nods, confused by his behavior. \nEXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE - LATER \nA banner hangs across the front of the lodge, \"DEER CHEER '05\" -- the first Friday of deer season in Wheelsy. Inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden lodge. RAMBUNCTIOUS MUSIC comes from inside. Partyers enter. \nGrant and Starla step out of his truck. As they do, one of Starla's students, Will, sees her and waves. Starla waves back. \nGrant notices this and grabs Starla's arm, a bit too hard, pulling her back. \nGRANT Who's that? \nSTARLA It's just one of my students, Grant. \nGrant stares at the boy with distrust, and ushers Starla towards the lodge. \nBill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this. \nGRANT Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know. \nBRENDA What? \nGRANT Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt. \nBrenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and starts unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks at her in her bra. \nGRANT Nice. \nGrant unbuttons his shirt as well.    As he removes it completely, he turns toward her. \nBrenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a veiny, blue-moss-encrusted yellow spout, huge and pulsing. \nBRENDA Grant!?    What -- ?! \nGrant grabs her.    She tries to push his arms away. \nBRENDA No, no, we -- \nBrenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls into the creek beside them. \nGrant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She struggles to get free. \nBrenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing, tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She SCREAMS. \nGrant shoves his hand over her mouth, shutting her up. He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches, feeling its way like a blind snake. \nThe tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh. \nBrenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid -- pumps through the tubule and into Brenda. \nGrant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms there beside him. \nThen she falls back, unconscious.   The tubule retracts into Grant's torso. \nEXT. WHEELSY SADDLE LODGE BACK PORCH - NIGHT \nStarla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the lights of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy. \nSTARLA Hey, Bill! \nStarla catches herself, and looks around to see if Grant is watching. \nBILL Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked. \nSTARLA That's not funny. \nBILL Sorry. \nSTARLA Whatcha' doin'? \nBILL Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass. \nStarla LAUGHS. \nBILL What you up to? \nSTARLA Just checking out the lights. \nBill and Starla look out over the city together. \nBILL Pretty, ain't they? \nSTARLA I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile. \nBILL Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot. \nStarla looks at him. \nBILL There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope. \nSTARLA Oh, yeah? \nBILL Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me. \nSTARLA I'll get Wally to show me sometime then. \nStarla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill. \nBILL Oh, will you now? \nSTARLA                            GRANT (O.S.) Or Rollo's ghost.               Starla. \nSTARLA Grant, no! \nGRANT I loved you.     I loved -- \nSTARLA Grant, you're sick! \nGrant is about to cry. \nGRANT I wanted you by my side, but you -- I can't trust you now! \nStarla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open. Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the \nnow enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it. It starts to poke into her skin. \nSTARLA Noooo! \nStarla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from under him. \nStarla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1. \nGrant thrusts the couch aside. \nStarla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her like a snake. \nStarla gasps for air. Her face turns purple.   She hears a SLAMMING on the door. \nBILL (O.S.) Starla?!!   Starla, are you in there?! \nStarla tries to speak but she cannot.   Suddenly, we HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN. \nBILL (O.S.) Starla?! \nStarla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living room. \nThey are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased humanoid strangling Starla from behind. \nTREVOR Fuck! \nThe cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking him. \nGrant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows, SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor. \nGrant slips out the back door and away. \nThe cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what the hell was THAT?! \nStarla rubs her neck, COUGHING. \nBill Pardy runs toward the back door. \nEXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT \nBill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area. Grant is nowhere to be seen. \nWe CRANE UP and AWAY from them as we... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nO.S. SNIFFLING. \nPASTOR (O.S.) Jesus, these past few days have been a trying time for us. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nWe PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs, mementos, \"Come home, Mommy\" cards, etc. \nPASTOR (O.S.) We ask you now for the safe return of our beloved Brenda. \nEveryone in this modest little church has their heads bowed as the PASTOR leads the prayer service. \nPASTOR Our sister. Our daughter.    Our mother. Our wife. \nBrenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING. His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats. \nPASTOR And we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart, wherever she may be. We ask all this in your name, Lord. Amen \nBill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands. \nBILL                               CONGREGATION Amen.                            Amen. \nBill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty. \nHe also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at Starla, and whispering about her. \nSHELBY (O.S.) Bill! \nBill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch unit. \nSHELBY Another ranch attack!   Up at the Castavets'. \nBill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally. \nJACK 'Ranch a -'?   What 'ranch attacks'? \nEXT. CATTLE RANCH - LATER \nPOV: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out, almost perfectly symmetrical. \nWALLY (O.S.) It looks like one of them psyche tests. What do they call it? \nBill and Wally are staring at the dog from above. \nBILL Rorschach. \nWALLY What do you see? I see a butterfly. \nBill moves on through the windswept weeds. \nBILL I see we're fucked.   Three ranches in three days. \nMargaret is taking measurements and writing in a note pad; she sees Bill. \nMARGARET So, I think I got it part-way figured. You want to hear it? \nBill nods. \nMARGARET So Grant -- I mean, we're saying this is Grant, right? \nBill nods. \nMARGARET Grant kills a cow right about here. See there's the blood, musta slit its neck. \nMargaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in the crushed grass. \nMARGARET So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs. \nTREVOR (O.S.) Hey, look! \nBill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand. \nTREVOR He knocked this'n's head clear over here! \nWALLY Put that down, numbnuts! \nBill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them. \nMARGARET So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew 'em all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest. \nTrevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark forest on the edge of the ranch. \nBILL He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it. \nTREVOR Think we should get up a search party, head in there? \nWALLY It's a hundred thousand acres. Be finding a needle in a fuckstack. \nBill has a realization.   He moves quickly for his car. \nBILL Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next. \nINT. POLICE STATION - LATER \nCLOSEUP: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous forest. A finger points to one of the red circles. \nBILL So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch. \nREVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle. \nBILL Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate. \nWally whispers to Margaret, amused: \nWALLY Looks like a chipmunk. \nBILL Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally. \nBill points to the next circle. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING \nKylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch, and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering to the Older Cop. \nJACK This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots. \nThe Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch as well. They see Bill with Starla. \nREDNECK Didn't know it was date night. \nThe Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS. \nREDNECK I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie. \nGOOD OL' BOY Shut up. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER \nThe posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nDarkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful, pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister. \nThe wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds. \nA rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and CLINKS on its half-bent perch. \nA piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING incessantly against the wooden wall. \nTrevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch, waiting, watching or dozing. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nInside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her. \nBill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be. \nThey sit there for a moment in the dark. \nBILL Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night? \nWally looks at them. \nBILL Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along. \nWally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story. \nBILL I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.' \nWALLY (to Starla) How far'd you get? \nSTARLA About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad. \nWALLY Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You son-of-a-bitch! \nSTARLA You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy. \nBILL Yeah, maybe I did. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nJack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass, trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and sees... \nA large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nBill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the forest. He has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to BE the disease itself. \nSTARLA Grant? \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nJack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers: \nJACK You said 'squid'! \nTREVOR It got worse. \nThe Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped. \nA parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth. He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and his body starts to spasm. \nJack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body, too, convulses, and he spits up blood. \nBill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the things oozing up Margaret's neck. \nBILL Margaret, cover your mouth! \nBill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone: \nBILL Don't let 'em in your mouths! \nOne starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face. \nStarla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls back onto the floor. \nA parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when, suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla. \nBill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them, flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to himself and Starla. \nEventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound. \nEventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from Starla's mouth. Starla looks around. \nShe sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering, holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front door of the barn. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nTrevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist. \nTREVOR They wanted us to eat 'em!   Why would they want that!? \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nBill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug. \nHe looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still lightly convulsing. \nHe gazes out INTO THE FOREST to see the parasites rushing away like an ugly wormy army, shaking the brush as they head off in different directions. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT \nParasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby. \nINT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back, her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm. \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking to the wood siding. \nINT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still. \nThere's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail. \nKYLIE'S MOM Kylie! You're gonna turn into a plum in there! \nKYLIE Prune, Mom.    Plums turn into prunes. \nINT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKylie's Mom is at the bathroom door. \nKYLIE'S MOM I know what turns into what. You got school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed. \nO.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement. \nKylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door. \nShe KNOCKS once, then opens the door to -- \nINT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards. \nKYLIE'S MOM Time to turn in, ladies. \nKYLIE'S SISTER 1 Just a couple more pages, Mom? \nBACK TO SCENE \nWith a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her fingers. Kylie spits up blood. \nKylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her. \nKylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it into the wormy thing. \nThe parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning it, and, finally, killing it. \nKylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it. The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal. \nKYLIE Mom!!! \nKylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and into -- \nINT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKylie runs to the stairway. \nKYLIE Mom!!    Mom!!! \nKylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the stairs and up the handrail towards her. \nO.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.   She looks in their direction, running toward their room. \nKYLIE Emily!!    Jenna!! \nKylie tosses open her sisters' door. \nINT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast wags its tail as it disappears down her throat. \nKylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody hell, trying to slap them off. \nKylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites off her sister. But there's too many and they're too fast. They slide into her sister's mouth. \nKYLIE No!!   Nooo!! \nHer sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood. \nKylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her. There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her, she crawls out -- \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT \nKylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far to jump, but she has no choice. \nSo she jumps down onto -- \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT \nKylie lands, hard, tumbling over. \nShe glances back at the front of the house. \nTHROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood. \nMore parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the grass. \nShe spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway in front of her. She breaks for it. \nShe throws open the front door, and jumps inside. \nThe things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck in the door jamb. \nThey SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward her. \nSo she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices the little bastards in half. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT \nKylie makes sure none are inside. \nShe feels for the keys in the ignition.    There aren't any. \nThe creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows, trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie, leaving her in almost complete darkness. \nKylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nStarla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken. All three seem to be in some mild state of shock. \nJACK                            REDNECK Both sides of the story!?       Both sides of the story!? \nSTARLA Why are you talking like Grant?! \nThe posse moves toward her. Starla is CRYING. The posse makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again: \nWALLY 'Cause I am Grant! \nWALLY                           REDNECK I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit -- \nJACK You swore to honor and obey -- \nOLDER COP                       REDNECK Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn gun down. \nSTARLA Don't come any closer.    I'll... shoot. \nWALLY You ain't gonna shoot me! You always needed me to protect you! You for damn sure ain't got the balls to -- \nStarla BLASTS Wally, blowing open a big crater into his face. \nWally falls to his knees.    Starla and Trevor look on in shock, as they see... \nA slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his face -- out of the Wally's brain. \nThe little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead. \nThe sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated. \nAnd then they leap at her. \nStarla tries to shoot them.   But she's out of ammo. \nShe and Trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their legs can take them. \nEXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT \nTrevor and Starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees rooted closely together, panicked, breathing heavy. \nTREVOR Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit! \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT \nBill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in. \nOne opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands on the car right beside Bill's hand. \nThe other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside him. \nBill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers. \nBILL Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk. \nHe grabs the police radio. \nBILL Trevor!   Margaret! \nEXT. TREE-THICK FOREST - NIGHT \nTrevor turns and sees Jack, the Redneck, and the Older Cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them, coming in fast. But he's able to grab onto his radio. \nTREVOR They killed Margaret! \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT \nKylie's two sisters jump onto the hood, SCREECHING.   They SLAM rocks on the windshield. Kylie SCREAMS. \nBILL (into radio) Where are you?! \nTREVOR (O.S.) We're coming your way, man! \nBill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the hood. Then he slams on the brakes. \nHe looks back and sees the two little girls running toward the car again. \nAnd he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also running toward the car. Kylie is SCREAMING and CRYING. \nKYLIE Go!   Go!   Please! \nBut, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the running diseased. \nBILL My friends are still in the forest. \nBill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the trees. \nBILL I can't hear when you're nodding. \nSHELBY Sorry. \nBILL We'll be there in ten minutes. \nBill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow- eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly: \nKYLIE The worms are in their brains. \nStarla, Bill, and Trevor look at her. \nINSERT - FOREST \nThe CAMERA TRACKS QUICKLY FORWARD, through the forest, and to a CLOSEUP on the Redneck, who is hunched over Margaret's body, eating her flesh. \nMATCH CUT TO a CAT SCAN of the REDNECK'S HEAD: a parasite is imbedded into his brain; its tail hangs down his spine, wagging just a bit. \nKYLIE (O.S.) Drivin' 'em around... \nBACK TO THE POLICE CAR \nBill stares at Kylie like she's insane. \nSTARLA She's right. We saw one -- one came out of Wally's head. \nTREVOR Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came out there -- \nSTARLA Kylie, how do you -- \nKylie is rocking back and forth. \nSTARLA Kylie, how do you know that? \nKylie shakes her head.    She doesn't want to answer. \nBILL Kylie, honey.    Please. (MORE) \nBILL (CONT'D) A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know. But we need your help to find out what's going on. \nKylie CRIES. \nKYLIE I was in the bath. It tried to go inside me and I -- for a minute I became it. \nBILL The worm? \nKYLIE I got it out. \nTREVOR What are they? \nKYLIE Part of him. \nBILL Who? (pause) Who? \nKYLIE Mrs. Grant's husband. \nStarla stares at her. \nKYLIE But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too. \nSTARLA What other stuff? \nKylie kind of points at the sky. \nTREVOR He's a fucking Martian?! \nBILL A Martian is from Mars, Trevor. \nKylie tries to think. \nKYLIE For real it looks like a needle. Its real face. But it always gots another. (MORE) \nKYLIE (CONT'D) He goes from place to place, worlds... planets... killing 'em. He takes over half of what's alive and eats the other half. Till they're gone. \nThey stare at her, freaked out. \nKYLIE Now he's here.     He went in Mr. Grant. \nSTARLA Through a wound on his stomach? \nKylie nods. \nKYLIE He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change. \nWe PAN TO the WINDOW of the HOME NEXT DOOR, where we can see a FAMILY gathered around a CORPSE, feasting on his goopy flesh. \nEXT. ROAD TOWARD WHEELSY - NIGHT \nSTARLA What's that? \nOur foursome look up to see a Buick Century parked at a haphazard angle in the middle of the road. The driver's side door is open. The headlights are still on. \nThey look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly approach the car, in the darkness. \nBill aims his flashlight into the Buick.   The keys are still there, but no one's inside. \nTrevor looks at the grill of the car.   It's dented. \nTREVOR They musta hit a deer. Probably got out to see if it's okay. \nBill and the others look around. \nBill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.   He turns, aiming the flashlight downward. \nA DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang on the sides of its head like a goldfish's. \nThe diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low growl. \nBILL Fuck me. \nThe deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head against the hard road. \nKylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like dying rabbits. \nTREVOR Bambi-rats! \nTrevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting go of his gun. \nKylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's going on from there. \nStarla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED BUCK, careening toward her. \nShe dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can. \nA TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him. Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle. \nStarla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the front seat. \nBut the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's ankle. She SCREAMS. \nHe yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road. But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power. \nThe deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him down the road as he HOLLERS. \nKylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him. \nAs Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition; the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the floorboard, pressing on the gas. \nThe Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the horned buck's mouth. \nBill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back. \nThe deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over, dead. \nBill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle. \nBill pulls the trigger, destroying her. \nHe stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on. \nKylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them. \nStarla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door. \nSTARLA Get in! \nINT. BUICK CENTURY - MOMENTS LATER \nBill fumbles for the radio controls. \nBILL Shelby! \nTrevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away behind them. \nTREVOR When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out! \nBILL Shelby! \nThe diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual. Some push on the doors. \nINT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT \nBill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers slip inside, trying to pull away more. \nBill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers. \nAn arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular saw into that. Blood spurts.     Bone grinds. \nA man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the circular saw through the crack and into the man's face. \nEXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT \nThe FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching his bleeding eye. \nINT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT \nBill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door across from him. He runs over to the space, when the circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's accidentally unplugged it. \nEXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT \nThe diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead. \nINT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT \nBill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have almost torn down one of the doors. \nSTARLA This is stupid. \nStarla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away the planks they nailed there. \nBILL What are you doing?! \nSTARLA We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance. \nBILL What? \nSTARLA He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him! \nBILL No, Starla!   No! \nAnother full metal plate is pushed off the door. A DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor looks down, in shock. \nAnd the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab him. \nBILL Nooo! \nBill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them. \nBill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm. \nStarla has pulled away enough boards of the other door. She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this side of the building anymore. She moves outside. \nEXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT \nBill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across the street. \nHe turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground. Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head for Bill to go. Bill is confused. \nThe diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath. \nDISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID Starlaaaaaaa!                  Starlaaaa! \nAnd they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they inherited from Grant Grant, such as: \nSMASHED-FACE MAN You said for better or worse! You lied! \nNO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND I gave you everything!         I.   Loved. You! \nSHELBY                           FAT SICK GUY It's not just about lesson       I wanted you by my side, plans! Hank Wilcox wants         sugarplum. But I'm too your pussy!                      ugly now, huh!!? \nMR. INAPPROPRIATE                WAITRESS Your daddy'd still be            You always thought I was a fucking your every hole          joke, ain't you? weren't it for me!! \nBRENDA'S HUSBAND You like Pardy better'n me? That's who you want to screw now?! \nSTARLA Grant... Please... \nThey surround her. They touch her body, her ass, her breasts. Pull on her clothes. She trembles. \nSTARLA I'm sorry... I know I haven't behaved how you -- how you want. I know. Don't... hurt... me. \nStarla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her calf, tasting her. \nStarla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her. \nSTARLA Grant?   We should talk. \nEXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT \nBill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back door, but it's locked. \nBill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY. \nHe peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws the window up further, and crawls inside the home. \nINT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT \nStarla stands at the base of the stairwell.    The SONG is louder. \nSTARLA Grant? \nShe starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her feet. \nINT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in the home next door, walking up the stairs. \nBill runs toward the stairwell here. \nINT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT \nStarla looks down the hall.    Most of the walls have been torn away. \nBetween wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom. \nIn front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his crusty tentacles to push the back button. \nEVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over. \nStarla walks toward him. \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room. Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls: photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family parties. \nSTARLA Hey, Grant. \nStarla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth. \nSTARLA You did some real interesting decorating here. \nGrant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent eye. \nSTARLA Hey. \nStarla walks by a window. \nSTARLA Look, the sun's starting to come up. \nStarla starts to open the drapes. \nINT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT \nBill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there. \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill. \nSTARLA Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know you wanted it dark. \nINT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with airplanes and sports memorabilia. \nHe peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is loaded. \nINT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStarla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall with the photos. \nSTARLA You like these memories, huh, Grant? \nGrant looks away from her.   Starla moves toward him, almost seductively. \nSTARLA You like being called Grant, don't you? \nThe diseased GLEEK at Bill, but Bill throws himself forward, letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade -- \nEXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT \nBill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house. \nThrough the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs. \nBill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass. \nHe UNLOADS the clip into him. \nThe diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant, using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward, wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant SCREECHES. \nINT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT \nStarla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade in the other. \nWith all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind Grant. \nGRANT Er...? \nIt EXPLODES. \nEXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT \nGrant's exploding flesh sends Bill flying backwards. \nINT. GRANT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nStarla is thrown back. \nEXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT \nAround the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly upward as they each plummet to the grass. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING \nBill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's splattered flesh is around him. \nBill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him. And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore. It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs popping out. \nINT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING \nStarla crawls forward to look down through the smoke: most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs. \nEXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER \nStarla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill standing there. She smiles. \nSTARLA Hey. \nBill smiles too. \nBILL Hey. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nBill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but no life remains. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nBill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of the street, with the keys still in it. \nBILL Starla, over here. \nEXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER \nIn the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out onto -- \nEXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY \nThe sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car. Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as they head up this long, barren road outside the city. \nEXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER \nBill and Starla pass through a small block of stores. \nStarla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual, HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes. \nBill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly. \n", "test1_input": "Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt. \nSTARLA I'll get if for you. \nGRANT No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back. \nHe moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked. \nINT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY \nIt's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant putting meat into a garbage bag. \nEXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY \nGrant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes it. \nEXT. OLD BARN - EVENING \nGrant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging the garbage bag. \nGrant comes upon the old wooden barn. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nGrant enters. It is almost completely dark.          He hears WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE. \nGrant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away. \nBRENDA Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die. \nGRANT Brought you munchies. \nGrant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead animals out in front of her. \nGRANT Been saving for a rainy day. \nCLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed. \nShe looks up at Grant. \nBRENDA Grant, I'm sorry if I did something wrong! I think I gotta -- I think I should go to a hospital! \nGrant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to the meat. \nBrenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested pork chop, pulling it toward her. \nWe HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn. \nINT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER \nGrant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform even more. \nINT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT \nThere's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried. \nWally tries to see inside. \nWALLY Grant around? \nSTARLA No.   He went to the pharmacy. \nWALLY Pharmacy? \nSTARLA He's got a... rash. \nBill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across the street, talking to another neighbor. \nBILL Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez? \nStarla shakes her head. \nBILL Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ? \nSTARLA No.   What...? \nBILL She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved. \nWALLY Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock. \nBILL The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant. \nStarla looks at him, surprised. \n", "test1_true": "Bill hands her his card. \nBILL Have him call me right away, okay? \nStarla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors' homes. \nStarla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked. \nShe looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage. Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what appears to be blood drop stains near the door. \nShe gains courage, and moves off toward -- \nINT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nStarla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat. \nINT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER \nStarla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then she swings the bat at the lock on the door. \nShe swings it again, GRUNTING. \nAnd again. \nFinally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door. \nStarla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to the floor. \nStarla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand, and enters. \nINT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT \nStarla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle, his tongue dangling out. \nStarla starts to CRY. \nShe moves quickly back inside. \nINT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nStarla runs to the front picture window, and looks out onto the street. She can't see any of the cops. \nShe turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone. She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number. The phone RINGS, and: \nSHERRY (O.S.) You've reached Chief Pardy at the Wheelsy Police Department. Please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible. \nThere's a BEEP.    Starla tries to speak through her SOBS, pacing: \nSTARLA Bill, it's Starla! \nAs Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some diseased cephalopod. \nSTARLA It's -- I think you better come over right away -- I think Grant's sick, he -- \nStarla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window. \nShe just stops.   They stare at each other for a moment. \nAnd then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL. \nStarla turns and dashes toward the back of the house. \nGrant disappears from the window. \nINT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT \nAs Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the front door to make sure Grant isn't following. \nINT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT \nShe runs past a wall of family photos. \nINT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT \nStarla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to the backyard. \nShe arrives at it, and flings it open -- \nGrant is there. \nHe lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes. He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy. \nGRANT Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?! \n", "test1_id": 276, "test2_input": "She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to see where the shots are coming from. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nThe posse run through this very dark forest after Grant, leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust. \nThey're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses -- a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing around brush. \nWALLY There he is!     Over there! \nThey FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees, but missing. He's too fast. \nEXT. CREEK - NIGHT \nGrant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek, and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick fronds as he moves up alongside the creek. \nThe posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant. \nJack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek. He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps going. \nThey come to -- \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT \nThe posse come up out of the creek. They've completely lost track of the diseased man-beast. \nThey stop, out-of-breath and looking around.   They whisper: \nTREVOR Where'd he go? \nMARGARET We ain't never gonna find that girl now. \nThe Redneck is WEEPING with rage. \nREDNECK I'll kill that asshole what he did to Charlie. \nBill sees Starla run up behind them.    He waves her back. \nBILL Starla, get the hell out of here! \nStarla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around, searching for some trail of Grant. \nMargaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts somewhere near a boulder. \nBill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder. Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed, lifts a tentacle. \nMARGARET Bill!! \nBill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face. \nBill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already slithering swiftly back into the thick brush. \nThe posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nThe posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust. \nTREVOR What the hell's that smell? \nWALLY It's something dead. \nThe posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant had brought Brenda. \nJACK It's coming from in there, ain't it? \nMargaret looks at Bill. \nMARGARET Think he's inside? \nBill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn. \nThe posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes. Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't react to the stench at all. \nBill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens. Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and Wally exchange a look. \nBill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to open it. Starla watches all this from the rear. \nMargaret swings open the door. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nBill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror. \n", "test2_true": "It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin are stained with blood. \nThe posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are equally astounded. \nOLDER COP Oh, shit! \nThey see the source of the awful stench: \nBrenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts. \nThe SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally. \nBRENDA Something's wrong with me. \nWALLY Uh, yeah. \nBill and Wally get in a little closer. \nBILL Brenda, um... \nBRENDA I didn't want no one to be seeing me like this. \nAs the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in agony. \nThe posse jump back.    They stare as she recomposes herself. \nBRENDA How are my boys, Bill?    Are they all right? \nBILL Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly? \nBRENDA I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm so hungry. I just never knew anybody could be so hungry. \nBrenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell. \nBRENDA Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? Little bit? \nTrevor gags and runs out of the barn. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nTrevor vomits into some bushes. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nBill eyes poor Brenda. \nBILL I think we best get you to a hospital right quick. \nWALLY What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill? \nAgain, Brenda SCREAMS.    Her body LURCHES FORWARD. \nOLDER COP Why's she doing that?! \nREDNECK Her tumors is moving. \nJACK Bill, get her to stop that shit! \nBRENDA It hurts! \nHer body lurches forward AGAIN.     She sobs. \nBRENDA Help me!!     Help!! \nAnd then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side. \nSTARLA Bill! \nBRENDA Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- ! \nBrenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling. \nBILL He led us here. \nAnd then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse, completely covering them before they can react. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nTrevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts knocks most of them down. \nTrevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway, covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 277, "test3_input": "WALLY Hey, sugarplum. \nPause.   Starla pulls the gag from her mouth. \nSTARLA What? \nWally speaks with Grant's cadence. \nWALLY Marriage. It's a sacred bond. Just like you said. \nStarla stares at him.   Wally almost looks weepy. \nWALLY I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all. I lost -- Lost my head. I didn't want to do none of the things I done. Not kill them pets. Not make Brenda a womb. But it's my nature, ain't it? How can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature? \nStarla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him. \nWALLY I wanted to tell you what was going on. But I didn't - didn't think you'd love me no more. I never knew... love, Starla, I -- \nTrevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop.   They see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag. \nMARGARET Wally? \nWally turns and stares at her like some angry animal. \nMARGARET You all right? \nWally doesn't answer. \nMARGARET Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good. \nTREVOR Margaret. \nTrevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at her, just like Wally. \nThe Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring at them. \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT \nKylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in the car, trembling, afraid to leave. \nShe HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home. They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts are stained with the blood they spit up. \nKYLIE'S DAD Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on out. \nHer family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with their milky eyes. Her youngest sister pushes her face up close to the window. \nKYLIE'S SISTER 2 Hi, Kylie.   It's me. \nHer family tries the door handles, but they're locked. \nKYLIE'S MOM Open the door, sweetie. I know we don't look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you. \nKYLIE Get away!! \nKYLIE'S MOM Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why not to be with your family. This is family fun day, isn't it? \nThey continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over. They SLAP the windows. \nKylie SOBS.   Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice: \nKYLIE'S SISTER 1 Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha- ance. \nHer Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield. \nKylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again. \nEXT. FOREST NEAR STRUTEMYER'S - NIGHT \nBill, out of breath, runs out of the forest -- \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT \nBill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked. Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse. \nBill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now, smashing the pickup's windows. \nBILL Hey! \nThe Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.   They turn toward him. \nKylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.    She unlocks the door, and jumps out of the car. \nBILL What's -- ? \n", "test3_true": "BILL What's going on here? \nKylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's: \nKYLIE'S DAD Well, hello there, Pardy. \nBILL What happened to you, Dwight? \nKylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm. \nKYLIE'S DAD Poison ivy out back, maybe? \nKYLIE'S SISTERS We're itchy! \nKylie is obviously in shock. \nKYLIE They're not my... They killed... \nBILL Okay. Y'all just wait in this spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics for you. Kylie can come with -- \nRANCHER (O.S.) Hey there, killer. \nBill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill, knocking him down. \nKylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing toward them through the fields. \nThe Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the shovel to bring it down again. \nBill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger. \nThe BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles. \nBill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased folks rush toward them through the fields. \nBILL Come on. \nBill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the diseased chase them. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nThe infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the Redneck recruit -- are all coming in towards Trevor and Margaret. \nMARGARET Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just sit down! You need to get some Goddamn rest! You're sick! \nStarla watches this, by herself, next to the creek.      She eyes a rifle in the dirt. \nJack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and tosses them into the dirt. \nTREVOR Let go!! \nMargaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens his mouth wide and -- \nGLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol. \nMARGARET It burns!! \nMargaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft. Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone. \nMARGARET What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?! \nJack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream- glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again, grabbing onto her neck. \nMargaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe, as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax. \nOLDER COP Meat. \nThe Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it. \nAs Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck opens his mouth at him, when -- \nSTARLA (O.S.) Let him go! \nThe posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing the rifle at the posse, trembling. \nSTARLA Trevor, come on. \nSurprised, they release Trevor. \nSTARLA What'd you do to her?! \nJack stares at Starla.    He too speaks with Grant's cadence. \nJACK There you go, sugarplum! Why you choosing camps 'fore you hear -- \n", "test3_id": 278}

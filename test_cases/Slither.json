HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nCLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard, in teacherly cursive. \nWe PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing out, \"SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\" \nStarla glances at the classroom of high school students. She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking, but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the class. \nSTARLA When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait -- he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment. \nThe boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks. KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits him. He CHUCKLES. \nSTARLA We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. But we're neophytes. We've been around two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350 million. You tell me who's the more successful species. \nA BOY raises his hand. \nSTARLA Will. \nWILL How's all this go with how the Bible says there ain't no dinosaurs? \nSome of the kids LAUGH at the boy.   Starla pauses, about to answer, when the BELL RINGS. \nSTARLA We'll tackle that tomorrow... Everyone bring your boxing gloves. \nThe kids start to leave. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nCelebratory banners are strung over this street, including one that reads: \"DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!\" We're in the center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups. \nMEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose. \nJACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a hunter's truck, double-parked, jamming up traffic. Jack jams on his HORN. \nJACK Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker! \nJack turns to see a MOTHER and her two CHILDREN on the sidewalk, listening and staring in shock. \nMOTHER Mornin', Mayor. \nJack smiles, a bit embarrassed. Jack notices a group of HUNTERS on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something up in the sky. \nHe looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nStudents file out of the open door for the day. Kylie, Starla's pretty student, is among them. She and her FRIEND are looking up at the falling meteor. \nKYLIE Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay. \nEXT. HORSE RANCH - DAY \nA RANCHER with a cleft palate turns his head to see the meteor, much closer to him. It's rushing down toward the treetops of a nearby forest. \nINT. GRANT'S OFFICE - DAY \nA framed wedding photograph of a very young Starla and a large man is sitting on a desk. The photo TREMBLES LIGHTLY, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth. \nGRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties, notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP. Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking relieved they didn't drop it. \nGRANT Just a tremor, boys. \nGrant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders with a Sharpie. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nFour cops -- BILL PARDY, the town's young,   relaxed, and handsome Chief of Police, WALLY, an older,   toad-like cop, TREVOR, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and   MARGARET, a mannish cop -- are standing stock-still in   the station parking lot. They CHUCKLE. \nTREVOR Did ya' feel that?! \nThey enter the station. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \n", "test1_true": "TREVOR I always get afraid when that happens, 'cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside? It's so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin' like that -- (snaps) Happened to my uncle Barry. \nWally and Bill LAUGH at him. \nWALLY Who told you that story, Trevor? \nTREVOR My aunt. \nBILL Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro. \nTrevor looks shocked, sad. \nSHELBY, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed. \nSHELBY Chief! We got a 'mergency over at the diner! \nINT. DINER - LATER \nThe four cops move in.   There's a COMMOTION.   Most of the patrons are standing. \nWAITRESS Back there, Bill! \nThe Waitress nods back through the service window, into the kitchen, where a large DOE is hopping around. A DISHWASHER stands on the counter, YELPING with fear. \nINT. DINER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nBill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter. The doe skips around. \nWAITRESS She slipped in, was eating trash. We seen it on TV, how they kill ya'-- \nBILL Right. \nWAITRESS So we thought we best call in. \nBill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer toward it. \nBILL Come on now, honey, door's this way. \nMARGARET It's open season. Let's shoot her. \nBILL She's just scared, Margaret. \nWALLY Also, Bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets. \nWally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter. \nBILL She ain't a bull, Trevor! \nThe animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret. \nMARGARET Goddamn bambi-rat! \nAs the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped in a telephone cord. \nThe cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves. \nBILL Get back. \nThe other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the doe, speaking calmly. \nBILL It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's gonna hurt you. \nThe doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to be soothing her. Bill gets closer. \nBILL That's right. Just gonna pull this cord out. It's gonna be all right. \nThe cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe, breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall. \nBill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking Bill over, and streaks out the back door. \nBill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond, dragging the telephone, tied to her leg. \nBILL Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night. \nEveryone LAUGHS.   Wally pretends to be on the phone. \nWALLY Chief of police there? This a squirrel. Bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker! \nEveryone LAUGHS some more. \nINT. GLASS WORKSHOP - EVENING \nGrant locks his office for the day.   His SECRETARY sees him going. \n", "test1_id": 276, "test2_input": "EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING \nKylie's Dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint family farmhouse. He sees Jack heading toward the ranch, and waves. Jack gives a little salute, while muttering to the Older Cop. \nJACK This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots. \nThe Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch as well. They see Bill with Starla. \nREDNECK Didn't know it was date night. \nThe Good Ol' Boy LAUGHS. \nREDNECK I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Charlie. \nGOOD OL' BOY Shut up. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - MOMENTS LATER \nThe posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle graze, finding places to hide. The sun sets behind them. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nDarkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful, pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister. \nThe wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds. \nA rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and CLINKS on its half-bent perch. \nA piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING incessantly against the wooden wall. \nTrevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch, waiting, watching or dozing. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nInside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her. \nBill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be. \nThey sit there for a moment in the dark. \nBILL Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night? \nWally looks at them. \nBILL Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along. \nWally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story. \nBILL I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.' \nWALLY (to Starla) How far'd you get? \nSTARLA About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad. \nWALLY Ha! A cop from the get-go!   You son-of-a-bitch! \nSTARLA You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy. \nBILL Yeah, maybe I did. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nJack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass, trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and sees... \nA large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nBill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the forest. He has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to BE the disease itself. \nSTARLA Grant? \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nJack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers: \nJACK You said 'squid'! \nTREVOR It got worse. \nThe Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped. \n", "test2_true": "Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of protest when he gets too close, and steps back. \nThe Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking. Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nBill and Wally stare out the window, motionless. \nWALLY What we gonna do now, Bill?   Cuffs won't even fit on 'im. \nStarla musters courage.   She stands, and moves out of the barn. \nBILL Starla, where you...? \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nGrant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest. \nINT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT \nBill motions through the barn window to Margaret. \nEXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT \nMargaret motions to Trevor. \nTrevor motions to the recruits. \nAnd Starla moves slowly in toward Grant. \nSTARLA Grant? \nGrant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes. His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready. \nStarla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in close behind her. \nSTARLA Grant?   It's okay. \nAs Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop. \nSTARLA You're just sick is all. But we'll take you to get help right now. I'll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore I would. For better or worse. Remember? \nGrant's huge milky eyes betray that he does. \nSTARLA Okay? \nThe posse inch in closer, tightening the circle. \nGrant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the posse stop, terrified. \nEverything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross breathing. Deep: In, out. \nSTARLA Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all right. \nGrant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS. \nThen Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away. His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again drags it toward the forest. \nWhile Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at him. \nGOOD OL' BOY You stop right there, you son of a bitch. I don't care what kinda leprosy you got. We need to find that girl. Now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard. \nPause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other. \nAnd then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up the front of the man's body, and back. \nThe front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he topples over. \nBILL Fire!   Fire! \nThe posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head. \nGrant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest. \nBill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly. \nStarla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods. \nStarla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she darts off after them. \nINT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the distance. \n", "test2_id": 277, "test3_input": "BACK TO SCENE \nWith a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her fingers. Kylie spits up blood. \nKylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her. \nKylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it into the wormy thing. \nThe parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning it, and, finally, killing it. \nKylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it. The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal. \nKYLIE Mom!!! \nKylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and into -- \nINT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKylie runs to the stairway. \nKYLIE Mom!!    Mom!!! \nKylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the stairs and up the handrail towards her. \nO.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS.   She looks in their direction, running toward their room. \nKYLIE Emily!!    Jenna!! \nKylie tosses open her sisters' door. \nINT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast wags its tail as it disappears down her throat. \nKylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody hell, trying to slap them off. \nKylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites off her sister. But there's too many and they're too fast. They slide into her sister's mouth. \nKYLIE No!!   Nooo!! \nHer sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood. \nKylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her. There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her, she crawls out -- \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT \nKylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far to jump, but she has no choice. \nSo she jumps down onto -- \nEXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT \nKylie lands, hard, tumbling over. \nShe glances back at the front of the house. \nTHROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood. \nMore parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the grass. \nShe spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway in front of her. She breaks for it. \nShe throws open the front door, and jumps inside. \nThe things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck in the door jamb. \nThey SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward her. \nSo she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices the little bastards in half. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT \nKylie makes sure none are inside. \nShe feels for the keys in the ignition.    There aren't any. \nThe creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows, trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie, leaving her in almost complete darkness. \nKylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS. \nINT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nStarla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken. All three seem to be in some mild state of shock. \n", "test3_true": "BILL 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics out here right away. We got four men down. \nBill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC.      He presses the button again. \nBILL Shelby, you there? \nStill, only STATIC.    Bill tries another frequency. \nBILL Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an emergency here. \nSTATIC. \nBILL Goddammit. \nBill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get reception. Trailing off: \nBILL Shelby? \nStarla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are visibly shaking. \nMARGARET Is he alive? \nStarla looks at Margaret, and nods. \nMARGARET Praise Jesus. \nTREVOR 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret. \nTrevor looks about to cry. \nTREVOR What the hell were those things?! You ever seen anything like that? You ever heard of anything like that? \nMargaret shakes her head.    Trevor looks at Starla, who also shakes her head. \nTREVOR Me neither. And I watch 'Animal Planet' all the fuckin' time! \nBill re-enters. \nBILL No reception out here. \nSTARLA Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there. \nMARGARET That's a long ways. Them worms are out there. \nSTARLA I'll keep my mouth covered. \nBILL No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em. \nMargaret and Trevor nod.    As Bill starts to leave, Starla grabs him. \nSTARLA Be careful, Bill. \nBill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.   He jogs off into the forest. \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER \nBill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying to remember which way he came from. \nHe gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope... \nAnd then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and scratch trying to get the things off of them. \nBill runs away as fast as he can. \nEXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT \nTrevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins. Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag is down around his chin so he can chatter. \nTREVOR It's got to be some Goddamn biological weapons. Government's testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears, right?! \nThey set down Jack and head back toward the barn. \nTREVOR I hope it ain't contagious. I'll be pissed as hell I turn into a big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I swear to God. \nStarla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and cracking. \nStarla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek. \nShe doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels down beside the water. \nStarla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re- wetting it. \nShe stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered in darkness. \n", "test3_id": 278}

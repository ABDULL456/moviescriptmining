INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in the shaft. 
PHELPS Jack, what are you doing?! 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
JACK Iím not doing anything!  (I donít have it either). 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button but gets no response. 
PHELPS I donít have it -- I donít have control! 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
JACKíS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the approaching ceiling. 
JACK Uh -- then I have a problem. 
INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer, slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching roof, covered with spikes. 
EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACKíS P.O.V. of the roof of the building approaching.  Fast. 
ETHAN Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do you hear me. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop. 
He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster. He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him. 
ETHAN (O.S.) Come on, Jack, come on. 
JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his hands, he SCREAMS -- 
--and heís crushed to death against the roof. 
EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was JACKíS signal. 
ETHAN Jack.  Jack. 
He closes his eyes, knowing what that means. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS also sees the static. 
PHELPS Man down.  Stay where you are.  Iím on my way. 
He gets up and races out of the apartment. 
INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the elevator button but it wonít even light up.  He studies the elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and SARAH did moments before. 
He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small door at the shaftís base. 
EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS hurries towards the bridge. 
PHELPS En route.

{"train": "INVENTING THE ABBOTTS \nScreenplay by \nKen Hixon \nFrom the Short Story by \nSue Miller \nMarch 21, 1996 DRAFT \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS \nFADE IN: \n1EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY                 1 (LATE SPRING, 1957) \nOPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped \"big-top\" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form. \nNEW ANGLE - TENT \n-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade. \n2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                   2 \nJACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his \"hero\" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley). \nJacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year). \nDOUG Didn't get invited, huh? \nJACEY Go to hell. \nDOUG Who cares? I'm not going and I got invited. \nJACEY Who invited you? \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                     2. \n2CONTINUED:                                                                2 \nDOUG Pam, I guess. I don't know. Didn't open the envelope. I mean, come on, every time an Abbott girl gets her period they have some party. \nJACEY Oh, shut up. \nDOUG Kotex parties, Kotex party hats, pin the Kotex on the... \nJACEY Shut up! \nJacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block. \n3      OMITTED                                                         3 \n4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                      4 \nELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker. Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down the busy hall. \nJACEY I tried to call you last night but the line was busy. \nELEANOR No it wasn't. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    3. \n4CONTINUED:                                                               4 \nJACEY It was busy all night. \nELEANOR Maybe you had the wrong number? \nJACEY Are you mad at me? \nELEANOR No.   Are you mad at me? \nJACEY No.   Who said I was? \nELEANOR I did. \nJACEY I just wanted to talk to you last night. \nELEANOR We can talk tonight at the party. \nJACEY I wasn't invited. \nELEANOR Yes, you were. \nShe points at Doug's chest. \nPAMELA Like your tie. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   7. \n10     CONTINUED:                                                   10 \nDoug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and points at her bust. \nDOUG Can I borrow a Kleenex? \nPAMELA Greaser. \nDOUG (mouth full of food) Got any smokes around here? \n11   INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          11 \nDoug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard. The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing \"MONA LISA.\" \nDOUG So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich? \nPAMELA Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully. \nDOUG So how come Alice's marrying him? \nPAMELA Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with. \nDOUG Jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                    8. \n11     CONTINUED:                                                   11 \nPAMELA Look, Alice is the good daughter, Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. That's just the way it works. Which one are you? \nDOUG You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess. \n12     INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)             12 \nThe band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little. \nLLOYD Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham. \nHe gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and AD-LIBBED toasts. \nThe band strikes up \"I Got the World on a String\" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor. \n(CONTINUED) \n12       CONTINUED:                                                    12 \nThe guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters. \n13       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT                    13 \nThe party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of high society for tonight. \n14       EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT                                 14 \nDoug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing \"You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog.\" He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance. \n15       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          15 \nEleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing \"In Old Monterey\"). Jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache. \n16       EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)                16 \nJacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb. \n17       EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT                    17 (MINUTES LATER) \nAs Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain. \nDOUG Three out of five? \nJACEY Two out of three. You serve. \nJacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce competitors. \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   10. \n18     EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY          18 \nLloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap. \nJACEY 'Morning. \nSteve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open. \nJacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over the wake. \nEleanor leans over to Steve. \nELEANOR You know you're going too fast? \nSTEVE (grins) Yeah, I know. \nThe boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water. \n20     INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT                        20 \nJacey is soaking in the bathtub.   Doug enters without knocking. \nDOUG Time to eat. \nDoug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to... \nDOUG Jesus Christ! \nJacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother. \nJACEY Don't tell Mom. \nDOUG Oh, shit... \n(CONTINUED) \n20     CONTINUED:                                                   20 \nJACEY (cutting him off) Just don't tell Mom. All right? \nDOUG Yeah, okay, all right. \nJacey walks out of the bathroom. \n21     EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER 1957)     21 \nLloyd Abbott's 1957 Cadillac pulls up to the pumps. Lloyd is behind the wheel, Joan sits next to him, Eleanor and Pamela are in the back seat. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons... \n22     INT. TEXACO STATION - JACEY                                  22 \n-- sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell. He hesitates as he sees the Abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them. He retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor. \nELEANOR (O.S.) Hi. \nJacey finds Eleanor standing in the garage doorway. \nELEANOR Congratulations. \nJACEY For what? \nELEANOR I heard you got accepted to Penn. \nJACEY Oh.   Yeah.   Thanks. \nELEANOR How'd you swing an Ivy League school like that? \nJACEY My grandfather went there.   I had the grades, so... \nELEANOR It stinks in here. \nJACEY I dropped something. (CONTINUED) \n22     CONTINUED:                                                 22 \nELEANOR Yeah, me. \nJACEY I just thought you and Steve... \nELEANOR Well, that's what you thought. I think Steve is... I don't even know what I think about Steve, I never think about him. I just do things. And let other people figure them out. That's what parents are for. They're real good at doing all the thinking. Why should I? (slight beat) Alice is going to have a baby. She and Kilroy didn't waste any time. He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour. She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness. I've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. Wallpaper patterns -- that's all she talks about. She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. That's another thing I never think about... wallpaper. (another beat) Well, I think this is called the silent treatment. I get enough of that from my father, I don't need it from you. Good luck at Penn. \nShe starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat. They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then: \nPAMELA Come on, Eleanor -- Dad's waiting. \n23     EXT. TEXACO STATION - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)                  23 \nThe Abbotts drive away. Jacey stands in the garage in the b.g. He watches the Cadillac disappear into traffic. \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    16. \n24     EXT. DOWNTOWN HALEY - INSIDE CADILLAC                         24 \n-- with Lloyd behind the wheel, Joan in the front passenger seat, and Eleanor and Pam in the back seat. Lloyd says to Eleanor: \nLLOYD Stay away from him. \nELEANOR Who? \nHELEN And don't forget your sport coat. \nJACEY Yeah, I'll go pick it up. \nHELEN Take Doug with you. \nJACEY I'm just going to the cleaners. (CONTINUED) \n34     CONTINUED:                                                     34 \nHELEN Take him along for the ride.   Go have a root beer at the Dog'n'Suds. \nJACEY I gotta finish packing. \nHELEN I'll finish up. Doug's going to miss you. \nJACEY Baloney. \nHELEN I think he will. \nJACEY Not much. \nHELEN Oh, dammit, Jacey, please -- take your brother with you. \nJACEY Yes, ma'am. \n35     EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                 35 \nJacey (behind the wheel) and Doug drive into town in the Plymouth coupe. After a long silence: \nJACEY If Mom starts having problems with the car stalling just change the fuel filter. It gets clogged up when she lets the gas tank get too low. \nDOUG Okay. \nJACEY And every-once-in-a-while take her to the movies so she doesn't just sit around the house all the time reading. \nDOUG She likes to read. \nJACEY She reads too much. (CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    20. \n35     CONTINUED:                                                    35 \nDOUG Okay, I'll take her to the movies. \nJACEY (slight beat) You want to go have a beer? \nDOUG Root beer? \nJACEY No, a beer. \nDOUG A beer beer? \nJACEY Yeah. \nDOUG Where are we gonna get beer? \nJACEY The bait shop. If you go in alone and nobody else is in the store, Ernie'll sell you a couple of bottles. \n36   EXT. DIRT ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY                           36 \nThe Plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two cornfields. Jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing on a bottle of beer. Doug urinates between two rows of corn. \nDOUG Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper? \nJacey gives Doug a quizzical look. \nDOUG You know, when I was in first grade. At school? In the boys' room? Remember I wouldn't let Mrs. Horton help me, so she went and got Mom out of her classroom, but I wouldn't let Mom help me either. I told her to go get you. Remember? \nJACEY Yeah, I remember. \n(CONTINUED) \n36     CONTINUED:                                                    36 \nDoug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A semi-trailer drives past with \"Midwest Steel Desk, Inc. -- Haley, Illinois\" painted on its sides. \nJACEY We should own that company. \nDOUG What do you mean? \nJACEY Midwest Steel Desk. Dad's file cabinet drawer. Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad's patent after he died. \nDOUG Says who? \nJACEY It's true. \nDOUG Mom's not stupid. \nJACEY I didn't say she was stupid. Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why he owns the company. \nPETER Will you shut up about the fucking Brylcreme! \nALICE It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent. \nPETER Do you hear me, Alice?!   Shut up! \nTheir BABY begins to CRY (O.S.) and they find Pamela standing at the top of the stairs. \nPAMELA The baby's crying. \n48       INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK STAIRWAY AND KITCHEN - NIGHT             48 (MOMENTS LATER) \nDoug sneaks down the back stairs and enters the kitchen as Lloyd and Joan enter from the garage pulling off their coats. Doug ducks back into the stair landing unseen. \nLLOYD Just stay out of it, Joan. \nJOAN Alice meant no harm, I think... \n(CONTINUED) \n48     CONTINUED:                                                     48 \nLLOYD (cutting her off) It doesn't matter what you think, it's their business. Alice is a spoiled brat, but she's Peter's problem now. So just take one of your pills and go watch Jack Paar, see what he's crying about tonight. \n49     INT. ABBOTT HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                49 \nDoug sticks his head out of the back stairwell and spots Peter pounding on a locked bedroom door. \nPETER I'm warning you, Alice! Open the damn door! Alice?! Dammit! \n50     INT. ABBOTT HOME - STAIRWELL - DOUG                            50 \nTrapped in the stairwell.   He hisses under his breath: \nDOUG Oh, shit!   Let me out of here... \nHe notices a small window in the stairwell. \n51     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - WINDOW - NIGHT                              51 \nDoug squeezes out of the small window, his legs dangling six feet above a large rose bush directly under him. \n52     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAYS LATER                       52 \nDoug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. He slows as he nears Pamela at her locker. She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see. \nDoug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says: \nELEANOR Hi, Doug! \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                      31. \n52     CONTINUED:                                                      52 \nThe girls giggle, \"Hi, Doug!\" has become a running punchline to them. Doug is so undone by their laughter that he walks into an open door. \n53     EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER, 1958)            53 \nJacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver. He's become very much the Ivy League man. Doug waits for him beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts across the street a CAR full of young women, including Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey hops into the car and calls out to Doug: \nJACEY Hey, Doug!   Get my suitcase! \nThe car pulls away and Doug irritably fetches Jacey's bag. \n54     EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 54 \nThe hood on the Plymouth is propped open.    Doug assists Jacey as he replaces the fuel filter. \nDOUG How do you know when a girl's... ready? \nJACEY What do you mean, `ready'?     Ready for what... sex? \nDOUG Yeah. \nJACEY They're all ready for sex. \nDOUG They are? \nJACEY They might not be willing but they're ready. Just have to make them think you're the only one around who has what they need. \nDOUG How do you do that? \n(CONTINUED) \n54     CONTINUED:                                                    54 \nJACEY Find out what's making them itch and scratch it. If they're scared, be dependable. If they're bored, be exciting. If they're on the rebound, catch them. \nDOUG What if you're not very dependable or exciting, you know? \nJOAN Well, if I were you I would talk to him and tell him... \nHELEN (cutting her off) No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do that. If you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself. \nJOAN I just thought you would like to know what he's done. \nHELEN And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan? \nJoan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away. \nHelen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch. \nHELEN I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me. \nDOUG Okay. \nHELEN Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has... oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her astray? \nDoug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                     36. \n64     CONTINUED:                                                     64 \nDOUG Well... jeez... I know that he's... that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean... Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him. \nHELEN (long beat) I see. (another beat) Go finish your homework. \nDoug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her \"tranquility\" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being. \n65   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)                 65 \nA drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license plates speeds away from town. \nIncongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face. \n66     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (WEEKS LATER)                  66 \nDoug walks home from summer school. He pauses to watch the workmen erecting the party tent in the Abbott's front yard. \nPAMELA (O.S.) How come you're going to summer school? \nDoug turns to find Pam at the driveway gate. \nDOUG I got an incomplete in U.S. History. \nPAMELA How did you manage to do that? \n(CONTINUED) \n66     CONTINUED:                                                   66 \nDOUG Mrs. Bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of Mamie Eisenhower. \nPAMELA (laughs) Why do you do things like that? \nDOUG I wish I knew. I just can't seem to help it sometimes. \nPAMELA Are you coming to the party? \nDoug shakes his head no. \nPAMELA It's my birthday, you know? \nDOUG Happy birthday. \nPAMELA Everybody's going to be here. \nDOUG I don't know.     Maybe. \nPAMELA Just come, okay? Please. \n67     EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - THAT NIGHT            67 \nDoug pulls the Plymouth up to the pumps. He's neatly dressed in a jacket and tie. Jacey comes out of the office and leans in the car window. \nDOUG Fill 'er up. \nJACEY (frowns) Nice tie. \nDOUG Oh -- mind if I borrow it? \nJacey puts the nozzle in the car as Doug climbs out. \nJACEY I thought you didn't like those parties at the Abbott's? \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   38. \nPAMELA Sorry about what? \n(CONTINUED) \n69     CONTINUED:                                                    69 \nDOUG You always do this to me. \nPAMELA You said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. So maybe I'm not sure what you're sorry about? \nDOUG I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay? \nPAMELA You're sorry for feeling me up? \nDOUG (embarrassed) Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it. \nPAMELA I accept your apology.   Let's dance. \nDoug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles: \nPAMELA Hi. \nDOUG Hi. \nPam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause. \nPAMELA Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit? \nThe mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   42. \n69     CONTINUED:    (2)                                            69 \nDOUG Home for the summer. (slight beat) It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor. \nPAMELA You're not poor, are you? \nDOUG Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college. \nDoug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells. \nDOUG I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce. \nPAMELA They're just separated. \nDOUG What's the difference? \nPAMELA I don't know, you'll have to ask them. \nDOUG So, where's Eleanor tonight? \nPAMELA Eleanor's... just not here. \nDOUG Is she pregnant? \nPAMELA No!    Who said that? \n(CONTINUED) \n69     CONTINUED:   (3)                                              69 \nDOUG I don't know, everybody in town is saying something different -- she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. So, which is it? \nTed steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder. \nDOUG Fuck off. \nTed is taken aback.   Pamela's eyes fill with tears. \nPAMELA Why do you hate me so much? \nTED Excuse me, asshole, but... \nDoug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela: \nDOUG I don't hate you. \n70     INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT            70 \nThe hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the doorway. \nJACEY You asleep? \nDOUG Nope. \n71     EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)            71 \nDoug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says: \nThe commencement exercises are being held in the sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium) announces the names of the graduates as he calls them forward to receive their diplomas. \n(CONTINUED) \n76     CONTINUED:                                                     76 \nPRINCIPAL Pamela Louise Abbott... \nPamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. \nLloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. \nDoug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. \nHelen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. \nJacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. \nAlice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. \nJacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms. \n77     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY                77 \nCommencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings. \nAs Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on. \nHelen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard -- there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other. \nLLOYD Congratulations, Helen. \nHELEN Thank you. Congratulations to you, too. Where's Pam going to school? \nLLOYD Hmm... Christ, I forgot.

I should be able to remember that. It costs enough. \nHELEN She'll do well there -- a very bright girl. \nLLOYD And Doug -- he's going to...? \nHELEN He got a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania -- scenic design -- theater. \nLLOYD Same school as... \nHELEN (filling in blank) Jacey. \nLLOYD Right.   Well.    Congratulations. \nHELEN Thank you, Lloyd. \nThey pass each other and head their separate ways.   Their chance meeting has not gone unobserved: \nJoan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel. \nAnd Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. \nLloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot. \n78     INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT                     78 \nA waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey, and Doug at their table. Helen and Doug are eating their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away. \n(CONTINUED) \n78     CONTINUED:                                                     78 \nAs Helen starts to open her purse Webb Crosby appears and picks up the bill. \nWEBB It's on the house. \nHELEN Oh, Webb, really -- that's not necessary. \nWEBB How many restaurants got an Ivy League busboy? That's worth a free meal. Charlie'd be real proud of these two highbrows. \nHELEN Yes, he would.     He'd be extremely proud. \nWEBB (to Jacey) You take good care of your little brother in Philadelphia, you hear me? \nJACEY Yes, sir. \n79     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)           79 \nThe Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat. \nHELEN Isn't that Pamela Abbott? \nIn the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. \nDoug grimaces as he recognizes her. \nHELEN It is Pam.    Pull over. \nDoug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her. \nHELEN Hi, Pam.   Do you need some help? \nPAMELA Hi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement. \nHELEN Well, maybe Doug can give you a hand? \nDoug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth. \nDOUG Where's the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack? \nPAMELA What thing? \nDOUG The thing, the base that the jack fits into? (finds it in her open trunk) This. \nPAMELA Oh, I thought that was just the 'spare-tire-holder-on-er.' \nDOUG Read your manual. \nPamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                     54. \n87     CONTINUED:                                                   87 \nDoug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract it from the molten pavement. \nHELEN Pam, would you mind running Doug home? I'd like to get to the bank before they close. \nDOUG (protesting) Mom... \nPAMELA Sure, Mrs. Holt, I'll drive him home. Thanks for stopping. \nHELEN Of course.   Bye-bye. \nHelen slides over behind the wheel and drives away. \nDoug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack. \n88     INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY                           88 \nJacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door. She calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill. \nALICE Excuse me -- could I get change for a dollar? \nThe waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up behind her. \nJACEY Can I help you? \nALICE Yes, I need change for... (turns to him) Oh... you don't work here, do you? \nJACEY No. I was just thinking about you. I was going to call you tonight. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                   55. \n88     CONTINUED:                                                 88 \nALICE (rattled) What?   Why? \nJACEY There's a picnic out at River Point on Sunday -- I wanted to invite you. \nALICE I couldn't. \nJACEY Bring Susan, kids love picnics. \nALICE (re: the dollar bill) I need change for the parking meter. \nJACEY Here. \nJacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change. Alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the coins. \nALICE Oh, thanks. \nJACEY Do you have time for an ice tea? \nALICE My mother's waiting by the car so I won't get a ticket. \nJACEY Maybe she'd like an ice tea, too? \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    58. \n89     CONTINUED:   (2)                                              89 \nPAMELA Like you used to. Like just plain Pam. \nDoug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize. \nPAMELA And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes. \nDoug stares at her as if he's never seen her before. \nPAMELA What are you looking at? \nDOUG You. \n90     EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - DAY (FOLLOWING SUNDAY)                90 \nJacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler. \nALICE (O.S.) Where is everyone? \nJacey sits up and finds Alice standing behind him. She carries a picnic basket. Other than a few children skipping rock into the river they are alone. \nJACEY We are everyone. \nALICE But you said... \nJACEY (overlapping) No, I didn't. I just said a picnic. I didn't say if anyone else was coming. \nAlice walks away.    Jacey jumps up and runs after her. \nJACEY Where are you going? \nALICE I'm sorry...

You came here to see me. Didn't you? That's why you didn't bring Susan along. \nALICE I'm married. \nJACEY I thought you were getting a divorce? \nALICE I am, but it's not final yet. Besides, I'm two years older than you. \nJACEY Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler. \n91     EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ANOTHER PART OF PARK -                 91 LATER THAT DAY \nJacey and Alice wander along a path on the riverbank. \nALICE I knew he would hit me. Peter's a real hot-head. I knew if he hit me hard enough, hurt me enough, that even my father wouldn't stand for it. Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed. That did it. He punched me. Broke my front tooth. \nJACEY Bastard. \nALICE So... what do you hear from Eleanor? \nJACEY I don't.   Do you? \nALICE No.   Did you love her? \n(CONTINUED) \n91     CONTINUED:                                                       91 \nJACEY We weren't in love, we were in heat. \nAlice blushes. \nJACEY Did you love Peter? \nALICE No. \nJACEY Then why did you marry him? \nALICE Because... \n92     EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT DAY                     92 \nJacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in behind the wheel (of her mother's Town & Country station wagon). He closes the door. \nJACEY Which tooth was it? \nShe points to a front tooth.      He leans over to look at it. \nALICE This one. I had it capped.       You can't really tell, can you? \nPAMELA Yeah.   Shit. \n104     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                   104 \nThe Plymouth approaches -- Jacey turns off the headlights and KILLS the MOTOR and coasts to a stop in front of the house next door to the Abbotts'. Alice gets out of the car, Jacey hurries after her, following her into her front yard. \nJACEY Alice... wait! \n(CONTINUED) \n104     CONTINUED:                                                    104 \nALICE Go away. \nJACEY It's the truth, you know it is. \nALICE No, no, it's all just... screwing. \nJACEY It's called making love. \nALICE Don't. \nJACEY Don't what? \nALICE Don't follow me. \nHe grabs her arm and stops her. \nJACEY What's wrong? \nALICE I spend all day, every day, just waiting and waiting to be with you, waiting to forget everything, you make me forget... but then when I get dressed and I come home, you... just... leak out of me. Leak away. I go into the bathroom and I wash you off of me and I remember everything. \nJACEY Remember what? \nLLOYD (O.S.) Alice?!    Is that you? \nLloyd's voice paralyzes them. \nLLOYD (O.S.) Alice? \nAlice steps out of the shadows and finds Lloyd standing at the front door. \nALICE Yes, Daddy... \n(CONTINUED) \n104     CONTINUED:    (2)                                              104 \nLLOYD Who are you talking to? \nPAMELA (O.S.) She's talking to me, Daddy. \nPamela rises from a wrought iron bench in another part of the yard -- she strolls over to Alice. \nPAMELA Just girl talk. \nLLOYD You can talk inside.     It's late. \nPamela and Alice go inside the house. \nJacey exhales, he is ashen. \n105     EXT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - NEXT DAY                        105 \nDoug hoses down the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Pamela pulls up in her car and gets out. \nDOUG Hi. \nPAMELA Hi. \nDOUG What's up? \nPAMELA I've been thinking -- maybe we shouldn't see each other right now. \nDOUG Oh, yeah?    Why? \nPAMELA Well... if my father... I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and... well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too. You know? \nDOUG Christ, why do you have to take care of them?

Sure.   See you around. \nPam's composure begins to weaken, but she quickly returns to the car before she can lose control. Doug turns the hose back on. He doesn't look up as she drives away. \n106     INT. HOLT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER)               106 \nIt is almost two o'clock in the morning. Helen has dozed off in her chair with a book on her lap. She is startled awake by a loud BANGING at the front door. Helen hurries to the door and opens it. Pamela is on the porch. She is out of breath and very distraught. Her CAR is parked in the middle of the street with its lights on and MOTOR RUNNING. \nHELEN Pamela, are you all right? \nPAMELA I need to talk to... \nJacey comes down the stairs, pulling on his bathrobe. Doug appears on the stairs behind him. \nJACEY What's wrong? \nPAMELA Alice took some pills, some of my mother's pills... \nJACEY Oh, Jesus, no... \nPAMELA She's all right, we took her to the hospital... \nJACEY I'll get dressed... \nPAMELA No! \nJACEY I have to see her. \nPAMELA No. That's why she sent me, she doesn't want you to come, she was afraid you would if you heard from someone else.

I'll let you know just as soon as she can see you. Please, don't make things worse. Don't. \n113     EXT.

Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak over the din of the LAWN MOWER.) \nJACEY How is she? \nPAMELA She's all right. \nJACEY Can I see her? \nPAMELA At the boathouse -- at the lake. \nJacey turns and dashes up the driveway. \nDoug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down the driveway and then up the street. \nDoug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam. \nDOUG What's going on? \nShe looks at Doug with tears in her eyes. \nPAMELA I had to... for Alice's sake. \nDOUG (puzzled) Had to what? What? \nPAMELA Tell Jacey I'm sorry. \nPam drives away. \nHELEN Why spend all night and half the day tomorrow waiting in Chicago for the Philadelphia bus? Why not just wait and take the morning bus to Chicago? \nJACEY Because... the sooner I get out of this fucking town the better. \nHELEN (slight beat; stung) Suit yourself. \n124     OMITTED                                                        124 \n125   EXT./INT.

HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                126 \nDoug and Helen sit across from each other, neither one has much of an appetite. They eat in silence for a few moments, then: \nDOUG Dammit... why can't he just leave them alone? \nHELEN Who? \nDOUG The Abbotts. I don't know why... why couldn't he just forget 'em? Just pretend they didn't even exist? \nHELEN If the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would've had to invent them, one way or another. There are no ends of Abbotts in the world, if that's what you need.

Then you were born. And Jacey just got lost in there. I didn't have anything for him. Mother took him over. He'd cry or call for me, and then I'd hear Mother answer him, and I'd go back to sleep. (sighs bitterly) I should've taken us away from here, gone somewhere else. \nDOUG Why? \nHELEN After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue. \nDOUG (stunned; almost ill) Christ... \n(CONTINUED) \n127     CONTINUED:   (2)                                            127 \nHELEN I went to see Joan, I tried to talk to her, to put her mind at ease, but... \nDOUG Dammit, why didn't Lloyd tell her that nothing had happened? \nHELEN I'm sure he did, but men always say that, darling. Besides, Lloyd was always having affairs. He's that type of man. \nDOUG Ahhh, Jesus... but why? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Abbott? \nHELEN Because she's Joan Abbott. If you cross Joan you don't get invited to her parties -- and the Abbotts have the best parties in town. The only parties. \nDOUG I hate this town. I hate the Abbotts. \nHe slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over. \nHELEN I'm sorry, Doug, I shouldn't have told you. \nDOUG I already knew. \nHELEN People still talk about it? \nDOUG No, I've never heard anyone talk about it. Not to me. \nHELEN Then how did...? \nDOUG Jacey. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                   85. \nThe traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street. \nPAMELA Just a party I got roped into going.

Bye. \nDOUG Bye. \nDoug watches her cross the street. \n133     INT. REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - THAT NIGHT                 133 \nDoug is revising a set design -- deeply concentrating on his task. He's startled by a KNOCK on the door. \nMALE STUDENT (O.S.) Hey, Holt! You got a visitor downstairs! \n134     INT. REED HALL - LOBBY - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)                 134 \nDoug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair. \nDOUG Did you miss the bus? \nPam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes: \nDOUG Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man... I better get you out of here before the Puritans tar-and-feather you. Can you walk? \nPam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door. \nDOUG Listen to me -- go out the front door, turn right, go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape. Okay? Just wait. \n135     EXT. REED HALL - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)           135 \nPamela leans against the side of the building as the fire escape ladder descends to the pavement.

REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                      136 \nPam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra). \nDOUG What were you drinking, Sterno? \nPAMELA I'm cold... \nDOUG Hold on, we got to get your pants too. Can you stand up. (as she collapses on the bed)) No, you can't stand up. All right. \nHe undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her pants. \nDOUG Nope, nope, let's keep the panties on, okay? Pam? Can you hold on to your underpants? (she's out) I'll hold on to your underpants. \nHe holds her panties in place while he struggles to get her pants over her hips. \n137     INT.

REED HALL - DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT                      138 \nPam's wet clothes have been draped over the radiator. Pam is passed out, tucked in under the covers. Doug sits on the edge of the bed gently cleaning her face with a damp washcloth. \n139     INT. DOUG'S DORM ROOM - NEXT MORNING                           139 \nDoug   stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept with   his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have been   removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds that   the bed is empty. She's gone. \n140     EXT. BRYN MAWR - DORMITORY - TWO DAYS LATER                    140 \nPamela approaches her dorm carrying an armload of books. She starts up the steps then stops when she sees Doug. \nDOUG You're welcome. \nPAMELA I'm sorry, Doug. \nDOUG Shit.    That's it? You're sorry? \nPAMELA (suddenly alarmed) Oh Jesus... did we? \nDOUG Oh-Jesus-did-we what? \nDOUG She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you! \nJACEY I know.    I mean, I do now. \nDOUG Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge? \nJACEY Nothing.

Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood. \nDOUG I don't know   you! I don't know who the fuck   you are! You fuck everything.    You fuck everything up! Why did    you have to fuck Pam, too?! \nDoug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps, clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood. \n152     EXT. BRYN MAWR DORMITORY - DAY                                 152 \nDoug approaches Pam's dormitory. \n153     INT.

She just took some clothes and left. \nDOUG (lost) Oh, God... no... \nHis pain is so clear that it spurs the Clerk's sympathy. \nCLERK #2 Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but... well, I can give you her home address. \nDOUG (explodes with irony) Shit! Yeah, right... (slight beat) I mean... thanks. Thanks anyway. I know her home address. \n154     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY (DECEMBER, 1959)                  154 \nThe Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits    behind the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the    street. He smokes a cigarette and stares at the house --   the pavement outside the driver's window is littered   with butts. \n155   EXT. SHOP (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY                               155 \nAlice comes out on the street laden with packages and shopping bags.

It's nice to see you smiling. \nDOUG Sorry. \nHELEN Don't be.   Everyone has sad times. \nDoug dissolves into tears. He lowers his head and shields his eyes with his hand. Helen leans over and strokes his hair. After a few moments, he rises and wipes away his tears with a dish towel. \nHELEN I'll tell you a secret. I did have a friend. A man in Chicago. I used to see him when I went up to Chicago to visit Bea during summer vacations. \nDOUG 'Used to see him' -- you don't see him anymore? \nHELEN No. \nDOUG Did you like him? \nHELEN He was a wonderful man. A little boring, but really, very wonderful. \nDOUG How long did this go on? \nHELEN About eight years or so, it was when you boys were still at home. \nDOUG That's a long time. Did you ever think about marrying him? \nHELEN He proposed.   But, well, obviously, I said no. \n(CONTINUED) \n157      CONTINUED:   (4)                                                157 \nDOUG Why? \nHELEN Because I'm in love with... your father. With my memory of him. He was the one for me. Oh, I don't know... there's different kinds of love, darling. Some people you love no matter what. Other people you love if the situation is right. To me the best kind of love is the 'no matter what' kind. (slight beat) Well, I am a cheap drunk, aren't I? \n158      EXT.

Helen wearily attempts to rein in the unruly children: \nHELEN Too much noise, please. Let's finish up. Keep the glue on the paper. Sam, Lillian, Jack -- in your seats, please... \nHelen suddenly loses her energy and interest in policing the children.

UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA - THEATER - DAY (LATE        162 SPRING, 1960) \nDoug is on a cat-walk in the fly loft high over the stage floor. He strains as he drops 20 pound slabs of pig-iron onto a counterweight carriage, then he releases the line and flies a canvas backdrop up into the loft. He locks off the line, wipes his brow, turns, and finds Jacey standing behind him. \nDOUG What-the-hell do you want? \nJACEY Mom... \n163        INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL (PHILADELPHIA) - THAT NIGHT               163 \nDoug sits in an almost empty terminal waiting to catch a red-eye flight to Chicago. A group of just arrived stewardesses pass by chatting with a captain and other flight officers. Eleanor Abbott does a take on Doug, steps away from her co-workers, and doubles back to him. \nELEANOR Hi, Doug! \nDoug almost doesn't recognize her. She is twenty years old now and very grown-up, very stylish in her stewardess uniform. She smiles at him. \nELEANOR How's your chin? (as he doesn't respond) Remember... the pencil? \nDOUG Yeah.    I have a little scar. \nELEANOR You going home?

Oh no. Oh, Doug, I'm sorry. \nDOUG She had cancer. I just saw her Christmas. She was tired, but I thought she just had the flu or something. She didn't tell us. The hospital told Jacey when they called him. \nJACEY About what? \nDOUG I should live my own life. Stop being your shadow. I'm not like you, Jacey -- I don't want to be like you. \nJACEY You going to stay here?   In Haley? \nDOUG No. I was thinking New York. If I'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it. \nJACEY (long beat) I'm sorry. \nDOUG I know you are. (slight beat) Did you have to get stitches? \nJACEY Hmmm? \nDOUG Your eyebrow. \nJACEY My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches. \nDOUG Sorry. \nDoug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table. \nDOUG Found this in one of the boxes in the basement. \nJACEY What is it? \nDOUG A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad.

The war was on -- everything was mobilized. They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit. And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells. \nJACEY How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two? \nDOUG U.S. History -- high school. I should be an expert, I had to take the damn class twice. I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer? \nJACEY (reading aloud) '1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is.' \nDOUG Wonder whatever happened to it? \nJACEY He parked it at the bottom of the lake. \n169     EXT.

Don't stand here and wave good-bye... it makes me think of Mom. \nDOUG Okay.   See you. \nDoug turns and walks away.   Jacey climbs onto the bus. \n170     EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                 170 \nDoug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth. He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts' front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up). \nSusan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well- dressed children and their parents are in attendance. Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott parties has begun. \n171     EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY                                 171 \nA \"For Sale\" sign has been placed on the front yard.

ABBOTT HOME - TENT - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                172 \nDespite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes Doug, then: \nLLOYD What do you want? \nDOUG I want to talk to you. \n173     INT.

What? \nDOUG Why are we talking about Eleanor? \nPAMELA I didn't bring her up. \nDOUG Look, either you're mad at me 'cause you're mad at me -- or you're mad at me 'cause you like me. 'Cause that's how girls act. I don't know much, but I know that. So like which is it? \nPAMELA Both. \nDoug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion. \nPAMELA Doug... \nDoug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is Eleanor's breast that he is fondling.

Do you? \nHe kisses her with such ardor that she   interprets his answer to be yes, when in reality Doug   is only trying to silence her. He pulls his hand out of    her blouse and slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches    back into the sofa: \nPAMELA Jesus... \nHe tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away. \nPAMELA Stop it... stop it! \nShe shoves him away and jumps off the sofa. Doug looks at her with breathless confusion. She turns away from him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the buttons for her tears. She begins to sob and runs out of the room. \n45         INT. ABBOTT HOME - ENTRY HALL AND STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS         45 ACTION \nPamela dashes up the stairs. Doug comes out of the den looking for her. He is quite shaken: \nDOUG Pam?  Hey...

A hand reaches out and takes her hand -- it is Jacey. He's seated beside the door. He rises and leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit. \n98     INT. MOVIE THEATRE - BALCONY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)           98 \nJacey guides Alice to two seats deep in the shadows of the otherwise unoccupied balcony. They gaze at the screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his and they kiss passionately. Jacey slides his hand under her skirt. Alice presses herself against his hand and whispers: \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96                    65/66. \n98       CONTINUED:                                                  98 \nALICE Don't tell... don't tell anyone what we're doing... don't tell anyone... no one can know, Jacey... no one... \n99       INT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT                99 (WEEKS LATER) \nThe station is closed and locked up for the night. Jacey and Alice are naked in the back seat of a car parked inside the dark service bay. It is a hot and humid night. They are slippery with sweat. \nJACEY Marry me. \nALICE Impossible... \nJACEY Nothing's impossible... \n100      OMITTED                                                     100 thru                                                               thru B102                                                               B102 \nC102     EXT. BUS DEPOT (HALEY) - DAY                                C102 \nHelen leans out a bus window and calls to Doug, who is perched on the front fender of the Plymouth, which is parked nearby with Jacey behind the wheel. \nHELEN Don't forget to water my tomatoes! \nDOUG Okay, Mom, okay. \nThe bus pulls away. Doug waves as the bus goes down the street -- then he leaps with surprise as an impatient Jacey leans on the CAR HORN. \n102     INT. HOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (WEEKS LATER)            102 \nDoug and Pamela lounge on opposite ends of the sofa with his bare feet pressed against hers in a gentle shoving match. They are watching an episode of \"Sea Hunt\" on the TELEVISION. \nPAMELA How long is your mom gone? \nDOUG Two weeks. She goes up every summer to see this friend she went to college with. \nPAMELA Eleanor lives in Chicago. \nDOUG She does? \nPAMELA Yeah. She's going to stewardess school. \nDOUG What do they teach you at stewardess school? \nPAMELA I don't know.    How to wiggle your bottom. \nDOUG Maybe you should go there instead of Bryn Mawr? \nShe pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off his and clobbers him in the crotch. He moans and sits up. \nDOUG Oww!   Damn! \n", "test2_true": "DOUG Watch it. \nPAMELA It was an accident. Don't be crabby. \nShe pulls him down on top of her. She kisses the tip of his nose then blows his bangs off his forehead. \n(CONTINUED) \n102   CONTINUED:                                                  102 \nDOUG You want to... go upstairs? \nPAMELA No. \nDOUG I just thought maybe you were tired of just kissing? \nPAMELA I'm not tired of kissing.    Are you? \nDOUG No, but touching is nice. \nPAMELA We are touching. \nDOUG I just... you know... would like to see what you look like without any clothes on. \nPAMELA Doug! \nDOUG Aren't you curious? \nPAMELA No, I know what I look like without any clothes on -- I look naked. \nDOUG Can I touch your breasts? \nPAMELA Jesus. \nDOUG Just on the outside? \nPAMELA No. You can kiss me.      I like lips. \nDOUG You like lips? \n(CONTINUED) \n102     CONTINUED:   (2)                                            102 \nPAMELA I like your lips, block-head. I like being here like this. But I'm not taking my clothes off, 'cause if we do that, you know what we'll do. And I'm too... I don't want to be like my sisters. Not if I can help it. \nThey kiss but are almost instantly interrupted by the SLAM of the SCREEN DOOR. Doug looks up and does a surprised take as he sees Alice going up the stairs followed by Jacey. \nDOUG Shit... \nPAMELA Who is it? \nDOUG My brother. He just went upstairs with your sister. \nPAMELA With Eleanor? \nDOUG Alice. \n103     EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - NIGHT                             103 \nPamela rushes out of the house with her shoes in her hand. Doug chases after her in his bare feet. \nDOUG Hey... hold up! \nPAMELA Why didn't you tell me? \nDOUG Hell, I didn't know. What does this got to do with us? \nPAMELA My God... what is she doing? \nDOUG Why is it okay for you to sneak around with me, but it's not all right for Alice to sneak around with Jacey? \n(CONTINUED) \n103     CONTINUED:                                                     103 \nPAMELA Because I'm not Alice! And you're not Jacey! Alice is... is like my mom, they both get hurt so easy, they're like turtles without shells. \nDOUG Come on, take it easy. \nPAMELA You don't know my father. You don't know how he is about Jacey. He blames him for everything that happened with Eleanor. \nDOUG Eleanor fooled around with lots of guys, it's not Jacey's fault your dad kicked her out. \nPAMELA Oh, Jesus! He didn't kick her out, he put her in a nut house! He shipped her off to this clinic in Wisconsin. \nDOUG (taken aback) But... I thought you said she's in Chicago? \nPAMELA She is now.     They let her out a month ago. \nDOUG Oh, shit. \n", "test2_id": 25, "test3_input": "He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights. \nDOUG Just stand right there. \nHe takes the work light with him as he walks off stage. Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark. \nPAMELA (alarmed) Doug! \nDOUG (O.S.) It's all right -- don't move! Stay put. \nThere's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft. \nDOUG (O.S.) Almost, almost... hold on. \nWe hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick- change routine. \nPAMELA Oh, Doug, it's beautiful. \nDOUG The senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. So, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. And -- anyway -- I'm the one whose design got picked. \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                      94. \n143     CONTINUED:    (2)                                               143 \nPAMELA What scene is it for?     What play? \nDOUG (a tad embarrassed) Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt. \nPAMELA You're really good at this. \nDOUG It's like building models when I was a kid. It's fun. It's... make-believe. \nPAMELA You know, they tore that old farmhouse down? \nDOUG Oh, no.     Did they? \nPAMELA Yeah. \nDOUG They always tear down the wrong stuff. \nPAMELA Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so much. \nDOUG Missed you, too. \nThey kiss -- then Pamela pulls away.    Doug studies her, then: \nDOUG You have a boyfriend, right? \nPAMELA No. \nDOUG Well, what? You worried what your old man would think? \n(CONTINUED) \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                    95. \n143     CONTINUED:   (3)                                              143 \nPAMELA He doesn't care what I do, as long as I don't do it in Haley. \nDOUG Then what's the problem? \nPAMELA I can't... do this. \nDOUG Why not? I mean... okay. We don't have to go so fast. Shit, I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh? \nPAMELA No, I did. \nDOUG How? \nPam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle. \nPAMELA I'm on probation. They pulled a bed-check the night I was here. I have to be back in the dorm by ten. Gotta go. \nDOUG What about tomorrow? I could come up in the afternoon and... \nPAMELA No! It's just too late. It's all messed up. I can't seem to make things all right. The more I try the worse everything gets. I'm sorry. \nPam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby. \nDOUG Pam!   It's not too late! \n144   OMITTED                                                     144 \nINVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                     96. \n146      OMITTED                                                        146 \nA148     INT.

Jacey scrutinizes his brooding younger brother. \nJACEY What's wrong with you? \nDOUG Nothing. \nA boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is distant, slightly off-balance. \nDOUG Hi. \nPAMELA Hi.

You want another cup of... \nJacey steps out of the kitchen and frowns when he sees Pam. \nJACEY I told you not to come by on Sundays. \nPAMELA I forgot. \nThe breath goes out of Doug as if he'd been struck in the stomach. \nJACEY Dammit, why didn't you call first? \nPAMELA Didn't have any nickels. \nJACEY Well, I didn't expect to see you again. You want to fuck? I mean, that's why you came over, right? \nPAMELA (slight beat) Sure. \nJACEY Then take off your clothes. \nPamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if this -- he walks out the door. \n150      EXT. JACEY'S APARTMENT (PHILADELPHIA) - SIDEWALK - DAY         150 \nDoug comes out of the apartment house and walks up the sidewalk. Tears begins to stream down his face.

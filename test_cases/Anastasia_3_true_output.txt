It gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree  She climbs the tree and escapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away. 
Suddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold on to it tightly. But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD 
HER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her! 
Anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake. She jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED YELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP TEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM. 
A BURST OF SUNLIGHT 
as Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed and very relieved, she stands and looks around at the beautiful sunny wheat field. 
INT. CABIN 
Reality. Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her sleep and sits up in bed. TINY WISPS of smoke still swirl around her head. As she gets out of bed, she unintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him. Meetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door and walks out. 
Meetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending him sliding across the cabin floor. 
EXT. DECK - NIGHT 
Anya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently in the storm, as she smiles. 
IN HER DREAM 
Anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of a BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful little pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water; laughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a low flowering wall to look closer. 
PULL BACK 
REALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean... smiling. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE 
It's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the reliquary. 
INT. CABIN 
Meetoo finally rights himself from his slide across the floor and begins to bark into Dmitri's ear. 
EXT. DECK 
Anya is waving happily at the dangerous water. 
IN HER DREAM 
Anya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward her and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from the frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted to see them as she feels a distance recollection of who they are to her. 
INT. CABIN 
Meetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand. Dmitri leaps up with an "owwww!" and looks over at the excited Meetoo.

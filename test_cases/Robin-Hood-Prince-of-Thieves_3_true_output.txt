ON SCAFFOLD 
Wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers. 
ON SCENE Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black armor. The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war. Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in. He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his horse. Will leaps on him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: WILL SCARLET Pain or death, you butcher? The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him. Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by four men. NOTTINGHAM Here's another message to Robin Hood, written in your blood. He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's belly. WILL SCARLET It's over, fool. You can kill my body, but you cannot kill our spirit. He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle. Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose, using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers. As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men. REDHEAD BARON It's Hood!   Get him! The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword. CHIEFTAIN I am iron.   I am rock. I am your death. Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out. ASLAN You talk too much! He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples, his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck. Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior. ASLAN Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants pursue. NOTTINGHAM Lower the portcullis! Now! A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him aside. NOTTINGHAM Too slow, fool! He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike. 
Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dismay that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves off the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged off and trampled down. ROBIN Friends!   We must raise the gate. 
EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY Crossbow bolts fly. Little John ducks and weaves, while spinning and firing at the men advancing at him from both sides. LITTLE JOHN Come on, ya ckicken-'earted buggers. Ya milksops, ya bleedin' pansies. He can't shoot fast enough. As they descend on him, he leaps from the battlements onto a soldier's back. Grabs his sword. LITTLE JOHN Excuse me, m 'old cock. Ya mind if I borrow this? He's backed up against a battlement, outnumbered five to one. 
EXT. CASTLE GATE - DAY Robin and the others try in vain to lift the portcullis. INT. CASTLE - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY The Sheriff marches through, issuing orders. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Seal the entrance. Guard it with your lives. ... Bring the bishop to my chapel.

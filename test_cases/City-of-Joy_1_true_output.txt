INT. LEPER COLONY - MEETA'S ROOM - DAY The rain continues, as does the work in the clinic. Max is working on Anouar, Aloka assisting. Meeta and the baby (now 6 months old) in the b.g. ANOUAR I think Aloka would have a gentler touch than you, Max Daddah. Maybe she should perform this surgery on her own. Aloka ducks her eyes, embarrassed. MAX Last time you told me you were more than two women could manage. ANOUAR Yes, but given a choice between one and none, I will accept the one. Max lifts Anouar off the table and places him on his cart. MAX Okay, you ought to be good for another few days. Send in the next patient. 
Anouar scoots out. Max and Aloka both turn to the instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of scissors to the floor. Simultaneously, they bend to pick it up and bang heads. 
LOW ANGLE The first   impulse of each is to touch the other's head. But almost   simultaneously, their hands freeze short of touching.    Several months ago, Max might have tried to kiss her;   now, though, there is friendship and affection. FROM here,   we see a pair of bare feet. We COME WITH Max and Aloka   UP. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Shoba, a deeply concerned look on his face. Slowly his hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken wing. He puts the parrot on the examining table. 
INT. POST OFFICE - DAY Hasari seals a letter and a money order into an envelope, seals, and puts it into the slot. He is  clearly exhausted. Outside he can  see two Sikh merchants at his rickshaw, looking around in the rain for him. He hurries toward the door. HASARI Here!   I'm here! 
INT. SUBASH'S HOUSE - NIGHT Aloka and three women huddled beside a window, Amrita half hidden behind them. We PAN ACROSS a staircase TO another window, THROUGH which we see a doorway. In the doorway, Subash turns to smile a shy smile at Amrita; he shrugs. PAST him now, we see Hasari facing SUBASH'S FATHER and three UNCLES, surly men with hair matted with mustard oil. The Ghoshes are all seated on low chairs and stools. Hasari is standing. 
INT. ROOM - NIGHT Mr. Ghosh and the Uncles stare at Hasari, who stands politely and hopefully before them. MR. GHOSH (SUBASH'S FATHER) You're a rickshaw puller, am I correct? HASARI Yes, that's correct. He looks at his brothers, on either side.    They look at him. MR. GHOSH And I a partner in the workshop where your daughter is employed. Were you aware of that? HASARI Yes, yes, I was, my daughter told me, thank you. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MR. GHOSH Yes, well then, perhaps you can tell me why I would permit my son to marry your daughter. Mr. Ghosh raises his palms.    It's all over as far as he's concerned. UNCLE #1 Just a moment, please. The brothers huddle, whisper just loudly enough for Hasari to hear. UNCLE #1 Are you saying there's no way you'd consider this match? Mr. Ghosh shakes his head, shrugs his palms. UNCLE #1 Perhaps some inducement?    Would that be of any help? MR. GHOSH (considering this) What could he possibly offer? UNCLE #1 Probably nothing. But perhaps, in fairness, we should find out. Mr. Ghosh shrugs.    The huddle breaks.   All five men stare at Hasari. 
EXT. STREETS - DAY Hasari, mouth half open, flecked with spume, pulls a huge Marwari. He's pouring sweat, his eyes are blood- shot. He has never looked more like a horse. They arrive at a cross street. The Marwari gets down and pays Hasari. Hasari slumps against the rickshaw and, while he awaits his next rider, counts his crum- pled pile of notes and coins. 
EXT. CLINIC - DAY Max, Joan, Aristotle John, Margareta, Mehboub, perhaps a dozen others trying to raise the level of the low wall at the entrance with bricks. The wall caves in. Other people in the neighborhood rush to rebuild it. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MAX (shouting to the others) My dear friends, it's just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here. Thinking he's about to make some cogent remark about this unified effort... MARGARETA What's that, Doctor Big Brother? MAX The opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price. Joan begins to laugh; the others don't get it, query each other as to what's funny about that. JOAN I hate to admit it, junior, but that was actually quite witty. She whacks him on the shoulder with a wet, muddy paw. JOAN Ut-nobody laugh; it's a natural disaster -- we have guests. Everyone turns to...

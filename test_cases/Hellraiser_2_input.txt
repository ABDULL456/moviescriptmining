KIRSTY Yeah, there's room.  And there's Julia. 
STEVE I see. 
KIRSTY She's so damn ... English. 
STEVE Meaning what? 
KIRSTY Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight. Frigid. 
STEVE stops walking. 
STEVE I beg your pardon? 
KIRSTY (lightly) There ya go. (imitates his tone) I beg your pardon? 
STEVE We're not all frigid. 
KIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on their faces as they speak. 
KIRSTY Oh no? 
STEVE Oh no. 
KIRSTY It's not what I heard. 
STEVE (moves closer to her) Well you've just been talking to the wrong people. 
He kisses her, with considerable feeling.

67   INT.   PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY 
The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining. She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She serves a table with their food, and then starts back to pick up another order.   As she does so she's harangued from every side. 
1ST CUSTOMER Excuse me, Miss - 
2ND CUSTOMER I'd like some more lager. 
1ST CUSTOMER Miss! 
KIRSTY In a moment. 
2ND CUSTOMER Did you hear me? 
KIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so somebody else's voice cuts through the din. 
STEVE Hey, sex-bomb - 
She wheels round.

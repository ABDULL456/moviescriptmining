Hector sits with Kirsten and Amy, digging candy Nerds out of his backpack. He turns to the other kids, holding the box out. Both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy. 
Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby. 
HECTOR Want some Nerds? Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as... Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu: 
SGT. NANTZ Adukwu, bring your kit. Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz. 
SGT. NANTZ We're gonna cut one of these things open. See if we can figure out what makes 'em tick. Michele overhears, offering: 
MICHELE Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a vet... 
SGT. NANTZ You're a veteran? 
MICHELE (can't help but smile) No, a veterinarian. 
SGT. NANTZ Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um... Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles. 
MICHELE Michele. 
SGT. NANTZ Right. Michele. (smiles, embarrassed)) Sorry. Mottola walks up. 
PVT. MOTTOLA Sergeant. Can't raise anybody on the radio. We're cut off. Off Nantz' look... 
EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP 
Kerns, Correggio and TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are on watch, peering down to the street from opposite sides of the roof. All on edge, exhausted, dirty. No one says a word. Correggio eyes the other marines. They exchange an 'all- clear' sign. Then Correggio pulls up a radio. 
CPL. CORREGGIO 
(INTO RADIO) O.P. reporting. We're clear up here. Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke and flames rising from buildings in the distance, glimpses of white phosphorous raining down. A beat, then... 
CPL. CORREGGIO .fucking aliens. Kerns looks at Correggio, starts to chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Then Correggio laughs. It's infectious. It's desperate. Then the laughter slows. Stops. 
PVT. KERNS You think those things get scared? They're probably just grunts like us. Probably dumped into battle, told to go fight... Kerns looks out... The constant thud and crack of warfare... A city crumbling. V 
PVT. KERNS I thought I could handle it... 
CPL. CORREGGIO You are handling it. Thing I'm worried about is Nantz. 
PVT. KERNS Sergeant saved our ass at that ambush... He knows what he's doing. 
CPL. CORREGGIO Yeah? Tell my brother that. 
INT. SIDE ROOM / COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER 
Nantz enters with Michele and Adukwu. Stavrou and Harris are in the room with Martinez. They step aside, revealing... The ALIEN BODY on the floor. Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback at the sight of one of these things up close. 
SGT. NANTZ You sure you can do this?

THEO So why do you stay? 
SHEILA I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan. 
THEO I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers. 
SHEILA Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man. 
THEO (he ponders the thought) I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo. 
SHEILA (touches his lips) How much would you charge me for the lips? 
THEO More than you could afford. 
SHEILA Come on, bargain with me. 
THEO I could let them go for ten. 
SHEILA (she pulls away, slightly) You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill. 
THEO (smiles) If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him. 
54     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DECK				    54 
Sheila and Theo stand on the deck. Sheila scans the road leading to the house with binoculars. 
THEO What are you going to do about your brother? 
SHEILA You're here. 
THEO What about the guy he put in the body cast? 
BINOCULAR POV The road is empty 
SHEILA Momentary relapse. Except for that, he's been making progress. Sheila laughs. Theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck. 
SHEILA Junior is like a faithful doggy. He loves his birthday so much, that every year, before we can go pick him up... 
BINOCULAR POV Kastle's car appears, driving hell-for- leather towards the house. 
SHEILA ...he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own. Here they come. She hands the binoculars to Theo, who immediately trains them on the road. 
SHEILA My mom once had an affair. When my dad found out, he had Junior kill the man. The body was never found, but I think Junior took him to the alley. Theo lowers the binoculars and looks at Sheila. 
THEO Then it's true, isn't it? About... 
SHEILA ...lane six. Yes. 
55     EXT. KASTLE HOUSE, DRIVEWAY				55 
Kastle's car comes belly-flopping to a stop in front of the house. Kastle climbs out and gesticulates wildly to the couple. 
KASTLE (a loud whisper) He's here! Come on down!

INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100 
The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes on the flash of weapons fire ahead. 
INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101 
The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks, supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke. The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door open. 
Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as they fall back. 
Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower. 
Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst, prone.  Clean body hit. 
The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame thrower. 
The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls, engulfing the back half of the APC. 
INT. APC                                                102 
Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire. Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges, clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her inside. 
VASQUEZ Drake!  He's down! 
Hicks screams right in her face. 
HICKS He's gone!  Forget it, he's gone! 
VASQUEZ (irrational) No.. No, he's not.  He's -- 
Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door. 
HICKS (to Ripley) Let's go! 
Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE. Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman. 
HICKS Get on the Goddamn door! 
Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening, its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM! The creature is flung backward, its shattered head fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door, the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They slide the door home and dog it tight. 
EXT. APC                                                103 
The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium. 
INT./EXT. APC                                           104- 
Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang. 
Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his head turns.  The small hatch against which he was leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek, legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder. Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon, a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc. VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped unconscious, is dragged back inside. 
The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet. Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews, broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in the APC's wake. 
Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening, hideous jaws lunge inside... 
Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls, tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine thunders onto the causeway and away from the station. 
A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled. 
HICKS It's okay...we're clear.  We're clear.  Ease up. 
The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she slows the machine. 
HICKS Sounds like a blown transaxle. You're just grinding metal. 
EXT. APC                                                106 
The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking, acid-scarred mess. 
INT. APC                                                107 
Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins out of her seat into the aisle. 
RIPLEY Newt?  Where's Newt? 
Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified, but it's not the basket case catatonia of before. 
RIPLEY You okay? 
Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all back in his mind.

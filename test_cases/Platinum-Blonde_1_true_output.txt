STEW 
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight. 
Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable Gallagher. 
155. CLOSER THREE SHOT 
ANNE 
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do? 
STEW 
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith. 
Anne winces slightly at this name. 
GALLAGHER 
How do you do? 
There is a short, awkward pause. 
ANNE 
(bitter-sweet) 
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl. 
STEW 
Gallagher? 
Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing that he fails to get the dynamite behind Anne's casually pleasant phrases. Anne plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable now. 
ANNE 
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl. 
STEW 
(surprised) 
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny? 
ANNE 
(with a world of meaning) 
Yes - isn't it? 
156. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE 
Stew is beginning to realize that all is not well as it could be. 
STEW 
You see, we never look at Gallagher as a girl 
He breaks off. 
ANNE 
(with her eyes on Gallagher) 
No? What do you look upon her as? 
STEW 
(fumbling for words) 
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all. 
CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO CLOSE SHOT of GALLAGHER. She tries to back Stew up. 
GALLAGHER 
(not so comfortable herself) 
They all consider me just as one of the boys. 
STEW 
Right! 
157. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE 
ANNE 
(a deadly acid smile) 
Indeed? How interesting. 
GALLAGHER 
(same kind of smile) 
Yes - isn't it. 
Anne takes Stew's arm, drawing him away from Gallagher. 
ANNE 
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher. 
GALLAGHER 
(resenting the tone of dismissal) 
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith. 
ANNE 
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher. 
GALLAGHER 
Goodbye, Stew 
She leaves scene. 
158. MED. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND ANNE 
Stew turns and faces her. 
STEW 
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her. 
ANNE 
I thought I was very charming, Stewart. 
STEW 
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize. 
He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's direction. 
ANNE 
(furious) 
Stewart, please! 
She glares angrily at the departing Stew. 
EXT. TERRACE 
159. CLOSE SHOT 
Gallagher has just reached the ballroom when Stew catches up to her. 
STEW 
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.

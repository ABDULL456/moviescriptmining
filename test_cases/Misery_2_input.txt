--young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this: 
"...You've changed my life..." 
"...I'm your number one fan..." 
"...I'm a really big fan of yours..." 
"...I'm your biggest fan..." 
"...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books..." 
"...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well..." 
"...I'm your number one fan..." 
"...You've given me such pleasure..." 
"...I feel like you're writing just for me..." 
And now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, many times overlapping. 
"...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... love you... number one... number one... you poor dear thing..." 
This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, she stays that way-- 
CUT TO: 
THE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by the bed. It is dusk. 
She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked. 
ANNIE What are you doing on the floor? (crossing to the bed) It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. (She lifts him back into the bed, which causes considerable pain) I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy? 
PAUL (in pain) Perfect. 
ANNIE You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do. 
PAUL I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise? 
ANNIE I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver. 
Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She is never out of sight. 
ANNIE But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way." 
PAUL Show me the way? 
ANNIE Yes. 
She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match. 
PAUL When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, looking at him. 
ANNIE Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid the world of this filth. 
She hands him the box of kitchen matches. 
PAUL You want me to burn my book? 
ANNIE (she nods) Yes. 
PAUL You want me to burn my book? 
ANNIE I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best. 
PAUL This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, watching him. 
ANNIE (quietly) Then light the match, Paul. 
PAUL No big deal. 
ANNIE So you've indicated. Do it. 
CUT TO: 
THE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He can't do it.

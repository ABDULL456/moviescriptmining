3   EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3 Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders. Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby away, one arm around his shoulder. 
4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4 Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of water. CAROLINE (not much heat) Goddamn thing. (CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:                                          4 She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip. CAROLINE Oh, that poor man. There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks: TOBY I hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen. Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove. 
5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5 Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo" together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight. TOBY How's this thing work, anyway? CAROLINE (not confident) It makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow. TOBY And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium? 
CAROLINE Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days. TOBY But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City. CAROLINE Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us. If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador -- no money worries... It'll be like heaven on a June day. 
6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6 We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his eyes. CAROLINE Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City. Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out. CAROLINE/TOBY Forty-seven miles to go! 
Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells -- 
7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7 Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car. CAROLINE If I could have one wish right now -- only one wish -- you know what I'd like? I'd like to burn this damn Nash Ambassador to a crisp. (as Toby laughs) I'm serious. I hate it. I hate the factory that produced it, and I hate the man who invented it.

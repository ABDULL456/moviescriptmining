FLAEMMCHEN Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern. 
They bow stiffly. 
PREYSING Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance. 
KRINGELEIN I could not think of not accepting. 
PREYSING You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books. 
Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing. 
FLAEMMCHEN Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. (her arms go around Kringelein. They dance off) 
PREYSING I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein. 
BARON Oh, let the poor devil alone. 
PREYSING I did not ask your advice. 
The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a fight. 
BARON I think it would be much better if you went away. 
PREYSING We shall see who remains here the longer. 
BARON (shrugging his shoulders) As you will. 
Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron turns his back to him, watching the dancing. 
CUT TO: 
FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR 
FLAEMMCHEN You must look at my face and not at the floor. 
KRINGELEIN Yes. 
FLAEMMCHEN You're trembling. 
KRINGELEIN I never danced before -- in public. 
FLAEMMCHEN You dance splendidly. 
KRINGELEIN I'm happy, Miss Flaemm. 
FLAEMMCHEN Really? 
KRINGELEIN For the first time in my life, I'm happy. 
Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion. 
Flaemmchen watches him quickly. 
FLAEMMCHEN Let's stop -- I'm tired. 
It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's distress. 
KRINGELEIN Thank you, Miss Flaemm. 
They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's arm. 
PREYSING Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk. 
KRINGELEIN Some champagne, Miss Flaemm? 
PREYSING You may go, Mr. Kringelein. 
KRINGELEIN Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing? 
PREYSING What is this insolence? 
KRINGELEIN Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man. 
PREYSING Go away -- go away. 
FLAEMMCHEN Please -- please! 
KRINGELEIN You don't like to see me enjoying myself. 
PREYSING Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely. 
KRINGELEIN An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing. 
PREYSING You're discharged. 
KRINGELEIN Me? 
PREYSING Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged. 
Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it. 
Kringelein starts to laugh. 
The Baron steps into the scene. 
The Doctor slowly comes from the bar. 
KRINGELEIN You can't discharge me -- I'm my own master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm going to die -- do you understand? I'm going to die very soon. Nothing can happen to me now. Nobody can do anything any more to me. By the time you can have discharged me I shall have been dead already. (his laugh becomes a convulsive sob)

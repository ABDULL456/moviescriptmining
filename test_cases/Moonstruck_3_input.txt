RONNY Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink. 
Loretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head. 
LORETTA That wasn't my mother. 
EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house. 
They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be heard. 
ROSE'S VOICE That's my house. 
PERRY'S VOICE You mean the whole house? 
ROSE'S VOICE Yes. 
PERRY'S VOICE My God, it's a mansion! 
ROSE'S VOICE It's a house. 
PERRY'S VOICE I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? 
ROSE'S VOICE He's a plumber. 
PERRY'S VOICE Well. That explains it. 
The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up. 
NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP 
The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver slightly. 
PERRY Temperature's dropping. 
ROSE Yes. 
PERRY I guess you can't invite me in? 
ROSE No. 
PERRY People home. 
ROSE No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. 
PERRY I'm a little cold. 
ROSE You're a little boy and you like to be bad. 
PERRY We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. 
ROSE I'm too old for you. 
PERRY I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. 
ROSE Good night. 
She kisses him on the cheek. 
PERRY Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? 
ROSE Sure. 
He kisses her on the cheek. 
PERRY I'm freezing 
ROSE Good night. 
She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks after. 
INT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT 
Ronny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks. 
AL Another Old-Fashion? 
RONNY Loretta?

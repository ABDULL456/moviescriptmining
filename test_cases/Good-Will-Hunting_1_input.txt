SEAN It's not your fault. 
WILL (dead serious) I know. 
SEAN It's not your fault. 
WILL Don't fuck with me. 
SEAN (comes around desk, sits in front of Will) It's not your fault. 
WILL (tears start) I know. 
SEAN It's not... 
WILL (crying hard) I know, I know... 
Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this image. Two lonely souls being father and son together. 
INT. RED LINE CAR -- DUSK 
Will rides the Red Line, above ground. He looks out over the landscape. Small back yards, laundry hangs from wire lines. 
Chainlink fences, overgrown with weeds. 
EXT. SOUTH BOSTON PARK -- DAY 
Will walking through South Boston. He cuts through a park. A senior citizen is spearing trach for the city. 
INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Will at home. Not reading. Looks up at the ceiling. 
EXT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES -- DAY 
Will walks up to a nondescript building, he walks through the glass doors, into the lobby. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, RECEPTION -- CONTINUOUS 
Will walks into the lobby. A SECURITY GUARD looks up. 
SECURITY GUARD Can I help you? 
WILL Yeah, my name is Will Hunting. I'm here about a position. 
SECURITY GUARD One moment. 
The guard reaches for the phone. 
DISSOLVE TO BLACK. 
FADE UP to the sound of laughter. 
INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- DAY 
Chuckie is again regaling Will and the guys at their table. 
CHUCKIE Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you. 
MORGAN Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before. 
CHUCKIE Oh, Morgan. 
They both get up, in one another's face. This is a play fight. 
"You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?" 
WILL Sorry to miss this. 
INT. L STREET -- SAME 
Will comes back from the bathroom. 
WILL (to Chuckie) You and Morgan throw? 
CHUCKIE No, I had to talk him down. 
WILL Why didn't you yoke him? 
CHUCKIE Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude.  I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down. 
MORGAN (from across the table) What'd you say about me? 
CHUCKIE Shut the fuck up. 
Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie turns to Will. 
CHUCKIE (To Will) Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday. 
MORGAN You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in. 
Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out the door.

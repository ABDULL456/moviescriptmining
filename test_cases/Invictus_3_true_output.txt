Pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very slow jog through the mostly empty streets. 
When he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the palm of his left hand. 
CLOSE-UP ON PIENAAR'S HAND, where he has drawn a crude street map. 
Pienaar takes a left at the intersection. 
CUT TO: 
Another intersection, another peek at the map on his hand, and another left turn, takes the team -- 
EXT. CAPE TOWN WATERFRONT - DAY 
-- back onto the waterfront, to an idling FERRY BOAT, where the coach and the manager wait for them -- along with the player's wives and girlfriends. 
COACH I hope you're not that slow next week. 
Pienaar grins, stops. The team stops around him. 
SPRINGBOK FLYHALF What's going on? 
PIENAAR A change of pace. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FERRY BOAT - DAY 
The ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air. 
It is early winter. The seas are fairly rough. 
So are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night. 
SPRINGBOK HOOKER Who's bloody idea was this? 
ON PIENAAR, innocent as a lamb. 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY 
Behind the ferry, Cape Town and Table Mountain, in all their glory. 
Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons in modern history -- 
-- ROBBEN ISLAND. 
EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY 
Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals. It would be pretty -- 
-- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed wire, guard towers. 
(In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist destination.) 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY 
As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles over the Springboks and their partners. 
One of the Springboks turns to a DECKHAND, getting ready to moor at the jetty. 
SPRINGBOK LOCK How do they bring the prisoners here? 
DECKHAND On this boat. 
Sobering. 
EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY 
The Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with some relief, look around at the prison, humbled. 
NERINE (TO PIENAAR) Imagine being able to see Cape Town so close by. 
PIENAAR That would make it worse. 
They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all the others who spent much of their lives here, are very strong. 
CUT TO: 
VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE SPRINGBOK PARTY, in the EXERCISE YARD, the LIME QUARRY, the MESS HALL. None of the usual horsing around. This place affects them, deeply. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROBBEN ISLAND PRISON - SECTION B - DAY 
Section B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each side of a damp concrete hallway. 
A PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have ever seen them. 
PIENAAR Can we see the President's cell? 
PRISON GUARD Yes, of course. (leading them down past THE CELLS) We've done it up just the way it was. 
They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER. 
PRISON GUARD (pointing at the number) That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964. 
The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door. 
INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY 
Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room. 
A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view. 
When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time. 
This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world for over twenty years.

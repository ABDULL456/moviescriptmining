ROB Yeah. 
MARIE Good. 
Marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom. 
Rob just stands there... and the LIGHTING CHANGES. 
ROB (to camera) Over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women. And do they all look like Richard Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde? Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves... well, about nine million, give or take fifty.  And they're just men.  Regular guys. We're just guys, because I, even I, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club.  In fact, Marie is my seventeenth lover. "How does he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the Musical Moron Twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's going on?  Listen up, because I think I can explain, with all modesty aside: I ask questions.  That's it.  That's my secret.  It works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom.  There are still enough old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different.  If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway? 
...he goes through a door into the bedroom.  Marie is taking off her earrings. 
ROB Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on? 
MARIE God, you ask a lot of questions. 
INT. MARIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Rob stares at the ceiling as Marie sleeps on next to him. 
ROB (V.O.) But in the morning we were just two people, slightly hung-over, who were not in love, sharing the same space. And I feel... 
Rob looks to the camera. 
ROB Sex is about the only grown-up thing that I know how to do; It's weird, then, that it's the only thing that can make me feel like a ten-year- old. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
The two of them come out of the building and into the street. 
ROB Which way are you going? 
MARIE (points left) That way.  You? 
ROB (points right) That way. 
MARIE And so it is.  I'll talk to you later. 
ROB I'll call you. 
MARIE (smiles) Right. 
INT. RECORD STORE - DAY 
Empty.  Dick prices records out on the floor.  Rob leans against the register.  Barry sits on a stool next to him. 
They're top-fiving it.  Rob's heart isn't in it. 
ROB Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash. 
BARRY Ehh. 
ROB "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind. 
BARRY Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that? 
ROB Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer. 
BARRY (sarcastic) Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that? 
DICK Rob.  Phone. (whispers) It's Laura. 
Rob springs to his feet, takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord.  Deep breath. 
ROB Hi. 
LAURA - INTERCUT 
LAURA Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around? 
ROB I'll look for 'em.  How you doing? 
LAURA I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff... 
ROB Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk. 
LAURA We'll talk some other time. 
ROB Great... That's great. 
Rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone.

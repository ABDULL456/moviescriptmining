{"train": "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME \nby \nHoward Franklin \nDanilo Bach \nDavid Seltzer \nRevisions by Danilo Bach \nREVISED \nDecember 4, 1986 \nFADE IN: \nINT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING \nWinter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S promotion to detective, NYPD. \nThe party spills through the house -- front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here. \nANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey. \nMIKE (calling to his wife, for a family portrait) Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here! \nANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him. \nANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms. \nThe picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers. Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and uniform read:  \"FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE KEEGAN.\" \nSCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on MIKE'S SHOULDER. \nSCOTTY (to Mike) No joke?  You're being transferred to the 19th as your first assignment?  Who the hell loves your ass downtown? \nROOKIE (naively) What's the 21st? \nBROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in. \nSCOTTY What d'you care?  You'll never know. \nBROOKLYN Manhattan.  The Upper East Side, East 59th to 96th. \nThe ROOKIE stares, impressed. \nSCOTTY (to the others) Remember Curran from the Sixteenth? He posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy. He met Jackie Kennedy. \nBROOKLYN Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller's doorstep. \nANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on him. \nHELEN Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so proud of you!  What the hell took you so long? \nMIKE Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who put in the good word. \nANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with some of the kids in the next room. \nMIKE If T.J. didn't push for me, I never would've made it. \nBROOKLYN Bet your ass... I give you six weeks before you're back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops... \nMIKE Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook. \nBROOKLYN Hey, am I supportive, or what? \nANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S date -- a \"real\" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD. She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with an empty platter, catches the action. \nINT.  KITCHEN - SAME \nELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters. \nHELEN He left Elaine for that? \nWIFE #1 And what about little Scotty? \nELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers. \nHELEN (still staring) I'd like to tie her tits together. \nELLIE That wouldn't be too difficult. \nA nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young, hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at the private line. \nA glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving through the X-rated doorway. \nINT.  CLUB - NIGHT \nThe latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and dance. \nThere is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon. \nANGLE \nThe GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life. \nWIN Hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure... \nA MET BENEFACTRESS (effusively) Thank you so much for agreeing to host us tonight.  It's really extraordinary! \nWIN Glad I could be of help. \nCAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very special to him... \nWIN Claire! \nCLAIRE Hello, Win. \nAnd he embraces her. \nCLAIRE (introducing her companion) You know Neil Steinhart? \nHe grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to CLAIRE. \nWIN Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why is it Claire always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi? \nNEIL (to Win; meaning the club) This gives new meaning to the word nightlife. \nWIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE: \nWIN C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade... (smiles, cutting Neil out) You don't mind, do you? \nNEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as he is addressed by someone else coming his way. \nEXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT \nas a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the invitees. \nMANAGER (a dilemma) I'm sorry, Mr. Venza... \nVENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the CORNER. \nINT.  CLUB - NIGHT \nWIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can still be heard as they walk through the club. \nHe smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection here. \nWIN Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape. \nCLAIRE They've got two monsters now.  Both boys. \nWIN And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious? \nCLAIRE You didn't like him? \nWIN Looks a little constipated to me. \nCLAIRE (needling him) It's called \"solid\"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nVENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead. \nJOEY VENZA \nImmaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT \nWIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing, indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard. \nNEIL Don't tell me he's \"busy\".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and... \nMIKE Is she injured? \nCLAIRE (softly) No. \nMIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty that emerges from the darkness around her; her vulnerability penetrates to the very core. \nNEIL (to Claire) You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer. \nMIKE She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please. \nNEIL No, I will not step outside. \nMIKE Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave. \nNEIL (icily) I don't really see what that has to do with... \nCLAIRE (deadened; to Neil) Neil, do what he says. \nANGLE ON MIKE AND NEIL:  at a standoff. \nCLAIRE (quietly) Please. \nMIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows it. \nNEIL I'll be right outside. \nNEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door. \nANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A beat. \nMIKE Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? \nHer plaintive eyes turning to meet his. \nCLAIRE (lost) I've never seen anyone killed before. \nMIKE It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... \nShe lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness, and curiously reassured. \nMIKE We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get through it together. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nPHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at cross-current -- CAMERA FINDING LIEUTENANT GARBER, hustling through the bullpen, MIKE FOLLOWING, toward his office. \nGARBER I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it. \nMIKE (puzzled) I just sat and listened. \nGARBER Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza. \nT.J. has joined them. \nGARBER Venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and Venza likes it here.  I want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but I don't want her to know there is any real danger. \nT.J. I don't like what I'm hearing... \nMIKE (to Garber) I don't understand.  If there's any danger, why not just level with her... \nGARBER turns back to MIKE \nGARBER (with mock tolerance) T.J. your friend's a little dense. When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti... somehow I think my way is better. \nHe MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy. \nMIKE Chief? \nGARBER turns back. \nMIKE Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job. \nGARBER When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment. \nGARBER MOVES ON OUT.  MIKE and T.J. left alone. \nMIKE (disappointed) Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! (turning to T.J.) I got a 'choice' at all. \nT.J. Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess. \nEXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING \nOut front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's children returning from music lessons. \nAcross the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot. \nINT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING \nA notice behind the locked front door informs:  \"ALL VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED\".  MIKE displays his shield to the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking the time to inspect his credentials before returning them, then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY. \nINT.  ELEVATOR - SAME \nMIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls. \nINT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME \nThe elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall- papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings. \nThe front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him in. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME \nMarble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial; MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward. \nFloor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE, and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to be \"in charge\". \nGARBER (approaching Mike) You remember Detective Keegan? \nNEIL (expressionless) I do. \nThe doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE, reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it \"disinterested\"? \nNEIL I want to make sure that everyone respects the privacy of Miss Gregory's household.  You're limited to the outer vestibule, so you can watch the elevator, the kitchen, so you can get something to eat, and the washroom. \nT.J. (under his breath to Mike) So you can take a shit. \nThe THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you definitely don't take home to mother. \nMIKE (reacting; to T.J.) Not Koontz. \nT.J. Be happy.  He's good at this. \nGARBER (to Neil) We'd like to, just once, get a look at the entire layout, so we can evaluate security. \nCLAIRE This really isn't necessary.  The security in this building is about the best in the city. \nGARBER (ever the diplomat) I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory, but I'd consider it a favor if you'd let us look around. \nCLAIRE Be my guest. \nGARBER (to his troops) Guys. \nANGLE - HALLWAY \nas GARBER withdraws; MIKE, T.J., KOONTZ to start their check. \nMIKE (to Garber) What about when she goes out? \nGARBER Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out. \nThey split up. \nANGLE - MIKE \nfollowing orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the living room, watching him. \nMIKE (re: the \"door\") Pretty good. \nANGLE - NEIL \nturns, returning to CLAIRE in the LIVING ROOM. \nNEIL Why an I reminded of the Three Stooges? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER \nKOONTZ checking the windows and terrace. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KITCHEN - SAME \nRETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and dining rooms until he's in the kitchen. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nSpotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on. \nBut he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE WHISTLES, trying not to. \nThe English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly fanning the air. \nANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper, not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on, fluffing her collar, ready to go home. \nMIKE (chagrined) I like 'em toasty. \nANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused. \nMARY Good night, Mr. Keegan. \nShe moves through the kitchen and EXITS. \nINT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT \nNEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses from the hallway. \nThe TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile. \nNEIL You're here 'til what time? \nMIKE I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M. \nNEIL noticing the Renoir. \nNEIL When you're through with it, put it back, please, exactly where you found it, and don't use the library again.  I have to leave town for a few days.  Let's do everything we can to make this less of a trial for her, shall we? \nMIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock \"military salute\"; a click of the heels. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER \n2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE alone. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir. Like a man making the most of solitary confinement -- becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward, studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment, left slightly ajar. \nANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING. \nANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her -- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER \nThe uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until we can make out the word \"QUEENS\". \nEXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS \nThe neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it, sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second page.  He heads inwards... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nAfternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then \"chug-chugging\" to another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in the afternoon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY \nELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans, the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to \"try it again\".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel; but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to reach the accelerator. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks across the lawn towards them. \nMIKE Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to my car? \nELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed. \nELLIE Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think? \nMIKE I think television's a dangerous thing. \nELLIE It's twenty bucks in the bank. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - GARBER'S OFFICE \nGARBER is on the other end of the line. \nGARBER Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic. Fucking shopping. (he thinks) I don't see that we have much choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her she's a fucking lunatic. \nGARBER slams down the phone. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT \nMIKE sets down the phone. \nCLAIRE What did he say? \nMIKE He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times. \nMIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to feel \"comfortable\" in one another's presence.  It's plenty awkward. \nCLAIRE You live in Manhattan? \nMIKE Queens... You know Queens? \nCLAIRE My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School. \nHe politely tries to place it, with no idea. \nCLAIRE I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary. \nMIKE Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif... \nIt evokes a slight smile but nothing more. \nMIKE Maybe not. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT \nThe limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it stops moving. \nIt's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere; a PATROLMAN notices from the curb. \nMIKE (to the driver) Don't move it. \nHe flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in. \nANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS \nMIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her effortlessly in, zip. \nANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased. \nINT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT \nThey cross toward the up escalator; she knows where she's going. \nPERFUME LADY Hello, Miss Gregory. \nCLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert, scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They ascend. \nAt the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front, quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back. \nDARK-SUITED MAN I'm sorry... I thought this was down... \nANGLE ON MIKE; SHAKEN.  CLAIRE giving him a long unsteady look, too. \nCLAIRE Are you nervous? \nMIKE No, Ma'am. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SHOP - GIFT COUNTER - NIGHT \nMIKE keeping close watch as CLAIRE approves her purchase: a silver frame, containing an inscribed photo of CLAIRE and an elegant older woman. \nCLAIRE Would you wrap it for me, I'll be back in a moment. \nCLAIRE walks past MIKE. \nCLAIRE Could you come with me please. \nCLAIRE I wouldn't have missed it, Tony. \nANTONIA You look so beautiful... \nANTONIA looks up to see MIKE. \nCLAIRE This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned to protect me.  Antonia Bolt... \nShe looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the same. \nMARGE (change of tone) Hello. \nCLAIRE (introducing) Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike Keegan... \nMIKE (ultra respectful) Hello... (a deferential nod to Antonia) ... Ma'am. \nANTONIA (liking him; to Claire) He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle. (re: Mike's embarrassed reaction) And he blushes.  I like that.  Take good care of her. \nINT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT \nCLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW -- occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a wall, ever watchful... \nCLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING come up to him; just \"oozing\" seduction. \nPRETTY YOUNG THING I hear you're a policeman. \nMIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE. \nMIKE Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman. \nPRETTY YOUNG THING Ever shot anyone? \nMIKE Yes. \nPRETTY YOUNG THING Does it make you... hard? \nMIKE ... Hard? \nPRETTY YOUNG THING Erect.  You know, a \"boner?\"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man. \nMIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment. \nMIKE Would you excuse me, please? \nHE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye. \nMIKE Would you consider leaving here pretty soon? \nCLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time. \nCLAIRE People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal. \nMIKE (confidential) Hey!  There are crazy people here. \nCLAIRE Let's get a drink. \nMIKE Ah... I shouldn't... on duty. \nShe plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom entrance, MIKE following. \nCLAIRE I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. \nMIKE I'll come with you. \nCLAIRE I think I can probably do that on my own. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies' room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns back to the bar, which is very busy and confused. \nMIKE (irritated) Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka martini. \nMIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing. \nMIKE Make it a double. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT \nas a pair of WOMEN finish their \"touch-up\" and head out, making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse down she moves to a stall and enters. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT \nMIKE and T.J. with GARBER, MIKE being CONGRATULATED by COPS who pass.  But GARBER doesn't look happy. \nMIKE (protesting) But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?! \nGARBER You apprehended him after he gave himself up -- \nMIKE It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him. \nGARBER Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail. \nMIKE Even Joey Venza?! \nGARBER He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved \"good will\" by turning himself in. \nMIKE (protesting) What about when she identifies him?! \nGARBER If she identifies him. (turns, unloading on him) Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him. \nGARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed. \nT.J. Wasn't your fault. \nMIKE (exasperated) It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON \nA tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads for the front door. \nINT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON \nMIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in another room.  She joins MIKE. \nELLIE The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you? \nMIKE (upset) Oh, some shit. \nELLIE What shit, honey? \nMIKE You don't want to hear about it. \nELLIE begins to show him the place. \nELLIE ... Look at the fireplace.  You don't get workmanship like that anymore. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied. \nELLIE Ninety-seven five.  What do you think? \nHe nods, trying hard to \"be there,\" but ELLIE isn't fooled; she assesses him with concern. \nELLIE Honey.  You got him. \nMIKE I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. \nELLIE (the voice of sanity) She's got to identify him. \nMIKE Why? \nELLIE (taken aback) Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts. \nMIKE I think -- she's crazy. \nELLIE I'd identify him. \nMIKE I might stop you. \nA beat. \nELLIE Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay? \nMIKE (trying to recover) No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right? \nELLIE Where'd you get the tie? \nHe's wearing the tie CLAIRE bought him. \nMIKE (distracted) Bought it. \nELLIE It's not your taste. \nMIKE What did she say the down payment was? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CORRIDOR - DAY \nGARBER and MIKE on the carpet. \nGARBER (steamed) Don't tell me it was \"no big deal,\" it was out of line, it makes you look like an asshole, and it makes me look like an asshole.  She's coming in, in a few minutes to I.D. Venza.  If Steinhart's with her, I want you to apologize. (in motion) Let's get this over with... \nIn the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the shift already there, entering. \nKOONTZ Okay, we're gonna have a line-up here... \nThe OTHER COPS grab their things and scatter, not wanting to get involved in another cop's headache. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FARTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - SAME - DAY \nCLAIRE approaching with NEIL, with T.J. on guard-duty. \nGARBER Good morning, Miss Gregory. \nMIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes.  He sees how nervous she is. \nCLAIRE It was my fault not Detective Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the fuss. \nNEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last night. \nGARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE. \nGARBER (to Claire) You all ready? \nNEIL (playing the protector role) Will this take long? \nGARBER We'll see. \nGARBER TURNS, getting them started. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY \nThey crowd in; another MAN already standing there -- VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER.  A one-way window looks into the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ. \nGARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance. \nGARBER They can't hear you, they can't see you... (introducing pro forma) Mr. Venza's attorney, Mr. Neuman; arresting officer Keegan... (to Claire) Good luck. \nWith that, GARBER leads NEIL out.  NEIL manages a final concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes.  The DOOR CLOSES.  MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space. \nINT.  LINE-UP ROOM - SAME - DAY \nKOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP PARTICIPANTS IN. \nKOONTZ Okay, take a seat... you, put a couple phone books under your rear... \nVENZA enters confidently, with the others.  He's number three.  He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window, as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES. \nINT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY \nCLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear. MIKE aware of that fear.  VENZA'S LAWYER waiting patiently, casually. \nINT.  LINE-UP ROOM - DAY \nVENZA and the OTHERS WAITING, now STANDING ON DISPLAY. \nKOONTZ (V.O.) (OVER SPEAKER) Will everyone except number three please take one step back? \nVENZA'S JAW TIGHTENS, a flicker, before catching himself and controlling the reaction.  Realizing.  She's making positive identification. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SUBWAY - EVENING \nMIKE, empty-eyed.  On his way HOME. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nELLIE dressed for sleep, in a DISNEYWORLD T-SHIRT, pauses to glance with worried eyes -- toward the living room where WE HEAR the SOUND of a TV. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  on a couch, beer in hand -- mindlessly watching. \nSILENCE. \nMIKE (to Ellie, with finality) I'm due on at seven. \nHe dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink, exiting. \nANGLE on TOMMY and ELLIE looking distraught. \nTOMMY (dismally) We're not going to the game, are we Mom? \nELLIE (pulling herself together) Sure we are, let's go! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING \nMUSIC TURNED UP FULL. \nCLAIRE spills red wine over the counter, uncorking the bottle.  She leaves the stain, grabbing the bottle and a wine glass, taking them with her, in emotional extremis. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING \nANGLE on MIKE:  as he rounds a corner ALMOST BUMPING INTO the JOGGER from CLAIRE'S BUILDING; MIKE hurries, sidestepping him, HEADING toward the ENTRANCE. \nANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  SPRINTING INWARD. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT \nThe ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and MIKE steps out, breathless, confronting KOONTZ.  The MUSIC CONTINUES TO BLAST from behind the closed apartment doors. \nKOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement. \nKOONTZ She's a little upset.  You're going to have to piss in a bottle. \nHe holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine. \nKOONTZ (packs it under his arm) Sorry, I don't have any extras. Have a nice night. \nHE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second, before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares from within.  No other response. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT \nDistraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's poured. \nMIKE (O.S.) Claire? \nCLAIRE (frightened) What do you want? \nMIKE (O.S.) Open the door, will you? \nCLAIRE I can't open it. \nMIKE (O.S.) It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in... \nThe lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying. \nCLAIRE You put me life in danger. \nMIKE No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again... \nCLAIRE And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time! \nNear bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED: Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS PROPORTIONS. \nClenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed to FULLY SHUT. \nHE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S HALL - NIGHT \nMIKE (searching for her) Claire...? \nHe moves HURRIEDLY DOWN THE HALL to her BEDROOM, entering, without warning, to SEE HER REFLECTION in the MIRROR as she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES. \nMIKE What are you doing? \nThe dress on, she SWEEPS past him, heading toward the doors. \nMIKE stands by the front door as T.J. arrives to begin his duty. \nT.J. We're gonna need snow boots. \nMIKE nods, absently, entering the elevator.  The PHONE starts to RING in the apartment. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SUBWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT \nMIKE; miserable.  The \"QUEENS\" exit is SEEN APPROACHING through the TRAIN WINDOW; he attempts to pull himself together, rising, waiting for the train to stop. \nEXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME \nAs MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath catches.  His heart starts to pound. \nAHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN. \nINT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING \nHe rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on, but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears VOICES. \nINT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING \nMIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty; SCOTTY has come over on his own. \nTOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters. \nShe is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment. \nSCOTTY Calm down, everything is okay. Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably one of those peepers who've been making this neighborhood such a pleasure... \nSCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising. \nSCOTTY We all look like hell. \nBROOKLYN (rising) Well, there you are... (to Ellie, unconcerned) I'll come 'round in the car from time to time so you can get some sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled. \nHe gives her a peck, yawning. \nBROOKLYN Thanks for the coffee. \nELLIE (to both) Thanks.  You're terrific. \nSCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE. \nELLIE (sheepishly) I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife... \nMIKE (tensely) I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother. \nShe shakes her head, amused. \nELLIE Don't be ridiculous... That's all I need, rubbing up against your mother and grandmother every day... I can take care of myself... (gently, to him) C'mon, let's go to bed... we all need some sleep... \nCLOSE ON MIKE.  Feeling like absolute hell. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nMIKE is threading his necktie.  ELLIE stands behind him, in the kitchen, grinning. \nELLIE C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not? \nMIKE D'you have to say \"fucking\" every other word? \nELLIE What was that? \nMIKE You heard me. \nELLIE Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap. \nMIKE What're you talking about -- \nELLIE I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar! \nShe leaves the room, slamming the door behind her.  He looks at himself in the mirror, wondering what's possessed him. \nMIKE Fuck.  What's happening? \nINT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nMIKE sits at the table with a cup of coffee.  He watches ELLIE from the window. \nCLAIRE He's okay? \nT.J. spots, over his shoulder, the table, set for two. \nT.J. Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know. \nCLAIRE Oh. \nNothing left to say; she hides her disappointment with a nod. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT \nActive with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on his own reflection staring back at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT \nCLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background, her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park. \nTHE MUSIC CONTINUES OVER: \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT \nOutside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation. \nVENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment. \nANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window. \nVENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting into HIS CAR curbside and driving away. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT \nT.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD -- finally reaching our FLOOR. \nThe DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside. \nT.J. (fatigued) Tell me I'm dreamin'. \nMIKE I just gotta talk to her, T.J. \nMIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT \nSilent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly enters. \nHe pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE, immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the window. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER. \nShe becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak. Finally, he does. \nMIKE T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He knows about us. \nShe absorbs it, without response. \nMIKE (a beat; with difficulty) So does Ellie. \nShe nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her emotions. \nCLAIRE You told her? \nMIKE Not exactly. \nCLAIRE What do you want to do? \nMIKE I don't know. \nHer eyes turn to his.  She moves toward him and sits. CLAIRE pulls him close to her.  A soft GERSHWIN TUNE plays.  She sees how drawn MIKE is. \nCLAIRE You're tired. (smiles, gently) Let me watch over you tonight... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe KILLER enters the reflective maze. \nINT.  MASTER BATH - NIGHT \nMIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room ahead. \nINT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA. \nOn the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE. \nThe KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and MIKE IS BEHIND HIM. \nMIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM. \nMIKE Put it down! (beat) Think about it! \nThe KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST, NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to the floor. \nIN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes. \nMIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens himself against the wall and scurries back through the bath the way back into the BEDROOM. \nMIKE (entering, to Claire) Get on the floor!  There may be more! \nCLAIRE does what he says. \nMIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES momentarily, then RACES down the HALL. \nANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing T.J.'S CHAIR empty. \nMIKE (desperate) T.J.! \nMIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the KITCHEN. \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF. \nANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING TO HIM, rolling him over. \nMIKE (sobs) T.J...! \nMIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there is blood everywhere. \nMIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest. \nMIKE Live, T.J.  Please...! \nCLAIRE appears behind him, to help. \nMIKE (to her) Get security on the phone! Emergency! \nShe RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT. \nShe TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR, pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest. \nMIKE (his voice cracking) Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a heartbeat...! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NEAR DAWN \nMIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away, at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him. It is not yet dawn. \nFOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look, MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish. \nMIKE (softly) They're operating on him.  He's still alive. \nGARBER (grim) I heard. \nA long pause, as he looks at MIKE. \nGARBER I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike? \nMIKE (almost inaudibly) It should've been me... \nGARBER:  aware of his own dilemma. \nGARBER Then it would've been her, too. (beat) I don't know... but I gotta protect the Precinct, too.  You're on suspension, pending Disciplinary Hearings.  Don't hold your breath. And you're not to go near that woman until she's no longer under Police protection and this case is closed. \nANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER stands looking down at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SCOTTY'S KITCHEN - SAME - DAY \nMIKE on the telephone. \nMIKE You don't want to know. \nCLAIRE (V.O.) Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct. \nMIKE I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through. \nCLAIRE (V.O.) Oh God, that's great! \nMIKE (gently) Are you okay? \nCUT TO: \nCLAIRE - SAME \nCLAIRE (trying to brighten) Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular \"marching band\".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady -- \nShe attempts a laugh, trying to keep it \"light\". \nCLAIRE I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come... \nMIKE (V.O.) Oh that thing in Queens. \nCLAIRE (faltering) I'm going away after that, the next morning. \nCUT TO: \nMIKE - SAME \nImpacted by it. \nMIKE Where? \nCLAIRE (V.O.) Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found. \nCLOSE ONE MIKE:  absorbing it. \nMIKE When can I see you? \nCUT TO: \nCLAIRE - SAME \nCLAIRE I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. \nCUT TO: \nMIKE - SAME \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  beat. \nMIKE Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens. \nCUT TO: \nCLAIRE - SAME \nCLAIRE Tomorrow night.  Can you come? \nMIKE (V.O.) (torn) I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart. \nCLAIRE Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay? \nFighting tears; not wanting him to know it. \nMIKE (V.O.) Claire... \nCLAIRE No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really. \nMIKE (V.O.) I'll think about Wednesday. \nMIKE hangs up, torn. \nCUT TO: \nCLAIRE - SAME \nHangs up. \nTOMMY (thoughtful) Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad? \nELLIE I don't know Tommy. \nA LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention switches to a passing McDONALD'S. \nTOMMY Hey, can we go to McDonald's? \nELLIE Absolutely. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING \nOverhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes. Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and candlelight. \nGloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their places engaged in animated chatter. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd, PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible (KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd. \nSHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS), who APPROACHES, surprised to see her. \nGIDDINGS Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came. \nCLAIRE It was something my father always liked me to do. \nGIDDINGS (apprehensive) You're planning to speak? \nCLAIRE Not if you don't want me to. \nGIDDINGS (a brief hesitation) Well, of course, we'd be... honored... \nCLAIRE (understands; gamely) Just putting in an appearance then. \nSHE GLANCES around, her \"ESCORTS\" mistaking it for anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER \nSPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and fearing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER \nThe SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE, sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her dispassionately. \nCLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a segue to something new.  It's \"SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME.\" \nSHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the bandstand indicating that the change of music was his doing. \nHER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful, GRIN. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD. \nKOONTZ (as he passes) Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but you're out of your mind. \nUncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE. \nANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other. \nCLAIRE (overwhelmed) What a memory. \nMIKE Do you dance? \nCLAIRE Do you? \nMIKE Pretty bad. \nCLAIRE Let's do it. \nThey TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who knows it might be for the last time. \nMIKE They guys treatin' you all right? \nCLAIRE (too emotional to really talk) Yeah. \nMIKE I've been doing a lot of thinking. \nCLAIRE (a pause) I know. \nCLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes. \nMIKE Venza. \nOTHER PLAINCLOTHESMEN are COMING. \nMIKE At my house...! \nKOONTZ (shouting to others) Call a cruiser! \nCLAIRE ... Mike. \nMIKE (to Claire) It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy. \nKOONTZ (to Claire) Let's go. (to others; urgent) We're takin' her home! (swinging into crisis mode) Move it!  Get the cars! \nMIKE (pleading) Koontz!  I need you guys! \nKOONTZ We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals. (re: another cops's radio) Throw it! \nMIKE (pleading) No, I need'm now! \nCLAIRE (to Koontz) Go with him! \nKOONTZ My job is to protect you! (into radio) This is Koontz -- \nMIKE (near hysteria) No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please! \nKOONTZ I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him. \nMIKE WHIRLS, heedlessly, running for the DOORS, CLAIRE RACING AFTER HIM. \nPLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 (calling after her) Hey...! \nCLAIRE Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make them come with you! \nMIKE They can't, they're assigned to you!  I'd do the same thing! \nHe RACES OUT THE DOOR:  she in PURSUIT. \nKOONTZ (re: Claire) Go get her. \nPLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 hurries out. \nKOONTZ (reconsidering) Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us. Let's go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT \nMIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.  She JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK SHUT. \nMIKE (into his car) Go!  Get outta here! \nPLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR. \nPLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 Hey! \nMIKE Get OUT! \nCLAIRE They're assigned to me, they'll have to go if I come with you! \nMIKE HESITATES. \nCLAIRE (screaming) I'm not getting out!  GO! \nMIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb. \nKOONTZ (calling to him, emerging) Adams...!  C'mon, move it! \nANGLE ON COPS:  RACING FOR THEIR CARS -- SCREECHING OUT. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT \nMIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE TO HIS SIREN! \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE'S CAR - SAME - NIGHT \nMIKE'S terrified eyes glancing into the REARVIEW MIRROR. \nMIKE Turn off the siren...! \nINT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT \nMIKE I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door. \nVENZA I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so. \nMIKE Let my kid go. \nVENZA I'm not lettin' no one go. \nMIKE Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table! \nVENZA Don't you fuckin' give orders to me... \nMIKE Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in. \nMIKE turns to the window, about to shout. \nVENZA (to Tommy, an order) Under the table. \nMIKE I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head. \nMIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE. \nANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE \"beneath the table\". \nCLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his back; emitting a whimper of terror. \nELLIE Be careful, Tommy. \nHE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD. \nThe FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway. \nMIKE (frantic) Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your step.  Come slowly. \nANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his head.  It's impossible. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under the TABLE. \nANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL. \nANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about to STEP INTO THE LIGHT. \nMIKE Watch your step! \nVENZA (rising) What the fuck you doin'?! \nTOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN. \nMIKE There's a skateboard in the door! \nWith a sudden SOUND of TAPE \"RIPPING\" from under the TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR, rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE. \nANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS \"PINGING\" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE. The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES like the Fourth of July, mixed with the \"WHINE\" of bullets hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling through the dark. \nThe \"FIGURE AT THE DOOR\" is firing with both hands, SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down, wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two hands tied in front of her. \nELLIE (to Tommy) Stay down! \nThe ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA, trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW... \nMIKE Turn around, fuck! \nHe DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the \"FIGURE\" in the door, SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down. \nAnd then all is quiet. \nINSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly ceased; everyone is a state of shock. \nELLIE (desperate) Tommy...! \nTOMMY I'm all right. \nMIKE Ellie... \nELLIE I'm all right. \nThe overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the \"FIGURE\" in the doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS. Guns in both hands, still smoking. \nKOONTZ (emphatic) Fuckin' miracle, man. \nIn the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward. The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE, TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place. Listening to them come. \n", "test1_input": "The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out into the shadowed area of stacked rows. \nINT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA \nVENZA (stares, wildly) Two years ago you were begging me for the money.  Nobody would've touched you... \nWIN You're making an eighty percent return.  Which is what you wanted. \nWIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently. \nVENZA Don't turn away when I'm talking to you. \nWIN (beat with deliberation) Grease and water still don't mix, Joey. \nVENZA \nslashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case cutter... Then another... \nANGLE - WIN \nWIN (stunned) Jesus Christ... are you crazy? \nANGLE \nVenza slashes another. \nWIN Joey! \nVENZA \nturns, slashing WIN. \nWIN \ngasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound. \nANGLE - CLAIRE \nhearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S saying something she's supposed to respond to. \nVENZA \nslashing WIN again, losing all control. \nWIN (staggering back) Jesus...! \nCLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER \nSeeing WIN, she stops. \nANGLE \nVENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor. \nCLAIRE \nscreams, unable to imagine or believe it. \nVENZA \nlooks up, hearing her. \nWIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet. VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her. \nCLAIRE \nsteps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator, running. \nVENZA \nquickens his step, after her. \nANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR \nas she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they close shut, POUNDS the button again. \nANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE \nBut CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to RING. \nRelentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door. \nCLOSE ON CLAIRE \n", "test1_true": "ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE \nsagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and finally move away in the darkness. \nINT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in the darkness.  WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the light. \nMIKE T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you kidding me? (listening, not liking what he hears) Give me 20 minutes. \nMIKE hanging up the phone, turns to ELLIE. \nELLIE (mumbling from under the covers) Switch the light off on your way out. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT \nMIKE and T.J. disheveled and tired, drinking out of styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club. \nT.J. (grinning) Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far? \nMIKE (giving a half smile) Right behind you, T.J. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT \nA rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting attire. \nThe man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn. \nGARBER Did you ever hear the chatter. They're worse than fuckin' four- year-olds... Miller, let's clear this path here, all right? \nT.J. and MIKE arrive. \nGARBER (to them, on the move) Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of this place is dead.  And I got a witness, and a suspect... Joey Venza. \nT.J. reacts to the name. \nT.J. Where's Venza? \nGARBER Nice question.  I like questions like that. \nA massive \"GASP\" goes up from the CROWD as a cumbersome BODYBAG is brought up a stairwell from downstairs.  GARBER temporarily moves away to oversee. \nMIKE (to T.J.) Who's Joey Venza? \nT.J. Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in. \nGARBER (returning, re: the crowd) Okay, let's find out what we know. Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody know more than gossip about the deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to them myself.  Go. \nT.J. moves into action with typical \"T.J. style\" diplomacy. \nT.J. Okay, will all the beautiful people shut the fuck up, before it starts gettin' real ugly here! \nThe uniformed COPS take their cue, moving in for quiet. \nGARBER (to Mike, the \"new boy\") Keegan, go baby-sit the witness. Just sit and look impressive.  Make her feel protected.  And if you can get her boyfriend outa my hair, I'll promote you to fuckin' Joint Chiefs... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - CLUB - NIGHT \nA uniformed COP guarding the door as MIKE approaches, flashing his shield. \nCOP Quit playing with yourself, Keegan. I know who you are. \nMIKE (grinning) A Detective's supposed to identify himself. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, CLAIRE seated on a couch, catatonic, NEIL kneading her hand, trying to comfort her.  A KNOCK at the DOOR:  NEIL JUMPS UP to open it -- MIKE ENTERING before he gets there. \nNEIL (upset) Are you in charge here? \nMIKE No, sir... \nNEIL I asked for the man in charge... \nMIKE That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs... \n", "test1_id": 2043, "test2_input": "MIKE (amazed) Yeah, what a woman. \nHe marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning over his shoulder to see. \nCLAIRE Didn't do very well, did you? \nMIKE (a laugh) Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things. \nCLAIRE You were reading my Renoir. \nMIKE How did you know? \nCLAIRE You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir? \nMIKE (thoughtful) They're kind of fuzzy. \nCLAIRE You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind. \nMIKE No kidding. \nIn the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other, appraising. \nCLAIRE So, this could be your last night, huh? \nMIKE Could be, I guess. \nCLAIRE (a thought) Want to go out for a drink? (re: his surprised expression) I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail... \nMIKE (a beat) Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT \nCLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's company. \nCLAIRE (laughing) You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way? \nMIKE Absolutely.  Look at this. \nHe demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in ridiculous awkwardness. \nCLAIRE That's the dumbest walk I ever saw! \nMIKE (indignant) No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out. \nCLAIRE And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! \nMIKE (mock anger) Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business. \nCLAIRE Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me. \nShe takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT \nThe COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a glimpse of the strangeness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT \nCAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song being sung is \"SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME.\" \nMIKE ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... \nCLAIRE So it was \"love\". \nMIKE Yeah.  It was. \nCLAIRE And \"is\"...? \nHe hesitates; but nods. \nMIKE (confirming it) Yeah. \nCLAIRE That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...? \nMIKE No dog. \nCLAIRE I saw you with a dog, in my mind. \n", "test2_true": "CLAIRE But \"nice\". \nMIKE Very nice. \nHer envy is plain. \nMIKE What about Neil? \nCLAIRE You don't like him, do you? \nMIKE (a pause) What's to like? \nCLAIRE (amused) Tell it like it is. \nMIKE You asked. \nCLAIRE He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best. \nMIKE You could do better. \nCLAIRE (laughs) I'll miss you, Mike... \nANGLE ON BOTH:  the music playing. \nCLAIRE It was nice having you \"watch over me\"... \nMIKE Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  feeling a moment of awkwardness. \nMIKE Let's go home. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThe PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are seeing.  MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her shoulders. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe PATROL CAR comes to a STOP as MIKE and CLAIRE ENTER. \nANGLE ON THE TWO COPS AGAIN:  watching them go. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nAs they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the elevator -- looking at each other.  It comes to a stop, and neither moves; the tension is palpable. \nShe steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And in the moment of exchange is the return to reality. \nCLAIRE Good night, Mike. \nMIKE Sleep good. \nShe turns to open the door.  Entering she -- and we -- suddenly can see Neil pacing in the hall, b.g.  He's returned.  He looks up, worried and very upset. \nCLOSE ANGLES ON FACES. \nNEIL It's 3 o'clock in the morning. Where the hell have you been? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY \nMIKE heading down a LONG HALL TOWARD GARBER'S OFFICE: It's like running a gauntlet. \nCOP #1 Hey, Mike, tough night. \nKOONTZ I guess it happens, you know?  A chick gives you a ride in her limousine, the next thing she wants is to wear your clothes... (a beat) ... I heard he had her underpants on his head. \nThat one got to him; stopped dead by it, he turns, giving KOONTZ a challenging look. \nCOP #1 Ease up, Mike.  Ain't nobody gonna tell the old lady. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  cooling down -- then girding himself for GARBER. \nKOONTZ Ain't the first time the taxpayers paid for a blow-job neither. \n", "test2_id": 2044, "test3_input": "MIKE I'm sorry. \nELLIE I'm not saying it's your fault. \nMore silence. \nMIKE What did you do tonight? \nELLIE I watched TV. \nMIKE What did you watch? \nELLIE I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me. \nShe snuggles up to him. \nELLIE I'll make a reservation tomorrow for early dinner.  You can sleep till noon. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BROOKLYN RESTAURANT - EVENING \nTHE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on the East River.  It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in the world.  ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the conversation.  They scan menus to order. \nELLIE Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you... \nMIKE Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon. \nELLIE (carefully) I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift. \nMIKE Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. (evasive) I'll talk to Garber about it. \nELLIE (girds herself) I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him... \nMIKE (stopped) You talked to his wife? \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  incredulous. \nMIKE My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take? \nELLIE What's the difference? \nMIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond. \nELLIE Unless there's some particular reason why it feels better to be around her at night. \nHe shakes his head, dismissively. \nELLIE Is there, Mike? \nNo response; MIKE having trouble with it. \nCLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to glisten. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his own. \nShe looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does, is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an attempt not to cry. \nELLIE What, what is it?  Is it serious or what...?  Quit looking at me like that!  What's with this ridiculous silence?! \nHer eyes flush with tears. \nELLIE Goddamn.  I never thought this would happen to me... you fuckin' sonofabitch... \nShe UPSETS her SETTING, GETTING UP from the TABLE, shaking him off. \nELLIE I just want you off the case.  Get off it, or don't come home. (her voice trembling) And I want you to remember... when we're old... that when this awful thing happened... I behaved like a lady. (embittered) The kind of \"lady\" you apparently prefer. \nWAITER (approaching) We got some specials. \nShe BOLTS from the room; MIKE following her. \nMIKE (to the waiter) We'll be right back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nShe weaves toward the car.  MIKE goes after her. \nMIKE Let me drive... \nELLIE Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me. \n", "test3_true": "She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding. \nELLIE (through her tears; screaming) You fucker!  Don't tell me how much respect you have!  You dumb mother fucking FUCKER!  Now get off this case or don't come home!! \nShe RUNS to her car, BURNING RUBBER as she PEELS out of the PARKING LOT -- leaving MIKE, distraught, gazing after her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING \nTRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to answer. \nMIKE Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a huge favor from you, man.  I know Helen doesn't like you to miss dinner, but I need you to switch shifts with me tonight. (a beat) Just \"personal\".  I don't know what the hell I'm doin', I need some time to think. (angered) Look, do it or don't do it, but spare me the fuckin' lecture, all right? \nHe HANGS UP:  miserable. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING \nA SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS, as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as he LOPES INTO THE PARK. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's \"RED\"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into the park.  A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open, engulfing our sight of him... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER \nThe \"JOGGER\" returning, obscuring his identity from the parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel. Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard, he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING. \nIt's happening:  A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL, distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for the \"JOGGER\" to SLIP BY, making it inside. \nDOORMAN I know sweetheart... we have enough flowers here. \nANGLE:  VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting. \nDOORMAN No, no, sweetheart... not here... get going... Okay. \nANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER slip by and her mission accomplished. \nVIETNAMESE GIRL (sweetly, to Doorman) Have a nice day. \nTHE GIRL:  slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she skips off. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BUILDING LOBBY - SAME \nThe \"JOGGER,\" his face still obscured by the towel waits for the elevator, as T.J., arriving, ENTERS the building. They both enter the elevator in silence. \nANGLE on T.J. glancing at the JOGGER quizzically.  The JOGGER avoids his stare, CAMERA TILTING UP to the indicator, beginning to rise. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SPARKS' VESTIBULE \nCLOSE ON \"JOGGER'S\" key, entering the LOCK.  IT TURNS. \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE.  He ENTERS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME \nAs the killer closes the door.  He's in the kitchen.  All is quiet in there. \nIN CLOSEUPS, WE SEE his JOGGING SHIRT coming off, revealing a shoulder holster; a specially designed \"belt\" removed and laid on the kitchen table.  A \"SILENCER\" within. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING \nCLAIRE eagerly and earnestly preparing dinner.  She makes some fluffs, not really used to this.  CLASSICAL MUSIC plays.  She looks up expectantly, hearing the FOOTSTEPS. \nCLOSE ON CLAIRE:  surprised to see it's T.J. \nT.J. Detective Keegan is... Mike... \"Michael\" asked me to tell you he's under the weather. \nCLAIRE:  She handles it, crestfallen. \nT.J. He'll probably take the morning shift. \n", "test3_id": 2045}

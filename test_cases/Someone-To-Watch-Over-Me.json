The \"QUEENS\" exit is SEEN APPROACHING through the TRAIN WINDOW; he attempts to pull himself together, rising, waiting for the train to stop. \nEXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME \nAs MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath catches.  His heart starts to pound. \nAHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN. \nINT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING \nHe rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on, but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears VOICES. \nINT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING \nMIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty; SCOTTY has come over on his own. \nTOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters. \nShe is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment. \nSCOTTY Calm down, everything is okay. Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably one of those peepers who've been making this neighborhood such a pleasure... \nSCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising. \nSCOTTY We all look like hell. \nBROOKLYN (rising) Well, there you are... (to Ellie, unconcerned) I'll come 'round in the car from time to time so you can get some sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled. \nHe gives her a peck, yawning. \nBROOKLYN Thanks for the coffee. \nELLIE (to both) Thanks.  You're terrific. \nSCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE. \nELLIE (sheepishly) I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife... \nMIKE (tensely) I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother. \nShe shakes her head, amused. \nELLIE Don't be ridiculous... That's all I need, rubbing up against your mother and grandmother every day... I can take care of myself... (gently, to him) C'mon, let's go to bed... we all need some sleep... \nCLOSE ON MIKE.  Feeling like absolute hell. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nMIKE is threading his necktie.  ELLIE stands behind him, in the kitchen, grinning. \nELLIE C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not? \nMIKE D'you have to say \"fucking\" every other word? \nELLIE What was that? \nMIKE You heard me. \nELLIE Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap. \nMIKE What're you talking about -- \nELLIE I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar! \nShe leaves the room, slamming the door behind her.

He watches ELLIE from the window. \n", "test1_true": "ELLIE:  Tight jeans, workshirt, scarf tied around her head, she looks great.

MIKE sitting, on duty again.  He keeps to himself.  He doesn't move from his chair. \nCLAIRE finally enters.  She holds tensely, waiting, aware of his mood. \nCLAIRE Is everything all right? \nHis stare is unyielding. \nMIKE Yeah. \nCLAIRE They called here after you left... \nMIKE (sharply) She's okay.  Everything's okay... \nHe looks up. \nMIKE (anguished) I don't know you... \nCLAIRE This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else... \nMIKE You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke? \nCLAIRE (beat; sustaining) Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it. \nShe walks away; MIKE sits. \nINT.  CLAIRE'S STUDY \nShe turns to her table to resume work.  Scribbled pages litter the surface.  Her hands betray her.  It's an effort of will.  MIKE enters, moving closer. \nBeginning to cry, she feels his embrace, turning into it. \nCLAIRE Don't you think I know what this is doing.  I know you have a wife.  I know you have a family... I'm not asking for anything.  I don't want anything... Just please hold me I'm scared... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT \nCLAIRE lies asleep.  MIKE leans over her as she wakes, meeting his gaze, bringing him closer before he goes. They kiss.

Mike...? \nANGLE ON T.J., as the bedroom DOOR OPENS -- REVEALING MIKE.  T.J. recoils with surprise. \nT.J. Oh, man.  I don't believe you. \nMIKE steps out, closing the door behind him; distraught. \nMIKE (beat) All fucked up, T.J. \nT.J. issues a long, saddened sigh; just staring at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMIKE sits in a chair by the far wall, staring out toward Manhattan, which glows palely, in the distance.  Now PAN OVER THE BED where ELLIE lies asleep.  But as WE MOVE CLOSE TO HER FACE, WE SEE she is not asleep; wide-eyed, aware of MIKE in the chair. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nELLIE stirs as MIKE slips between the sheets.  She embraces him, starts to kiss him.

We're gettin' too old for this. \n", "test1_id": 2043, "test2_input": "MIKE I'm sorry. \nELLIE I'm not saying it's your fault. \nMore silence. \nMIKE What did you do tonight? \nELLIE I watched TV. \nMIKE What did you watch? \nELLIE I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me. \nShe snuggles up to him. \nELLIE I'll make a reservation tomorrow for early dinner.  You can sleep till noon. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BROOKLYN RESTAURANT - EVENING \nTHE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on the East River.  It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in the world.  ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the conversation.  They scan menus to order. \nELLIE Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you... \nMIKE Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon. \nELLIE (carefully) I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift. \nMIKE Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. (evasive) I'll talk to Garber about it. \nELLIE (girds herself) I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him... \nMIKE (stopped) You talked to his wife? \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  incredulous. \nMIKE My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take? \nELLIE What's the difference? \nMIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond. \nELLIE Unless there's some particular reason why it feels better to be around her at night. \nHe shakes his head, dismissively. \nELLIE Is there, Mike? \nNo response; MIKE having trouble with it. \nCLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to glisten. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his own. \nShe looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does, is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an attempt not to cry. \nELLIE What, what is it?  Is it serious or what...?  Quit looking at me like that!  What's with this ridiculous silence?! \nHer eyes flush with tears. \nELLIE Goddamn.  I never thought this would happen to me... you fuckin' sonofabitch... \nShe UPSETS her SETTING, GETTING UP from the TABLE, shaking him off. \nELLIE I just want you off the case.  Get off it, or don't come home. (her voice trembling) And I want you to remember... when we're old... that when this awful thing happened... I behaved like a lady. (embittered) The kind of \"lady\" you apparently prefer. \nWAITER (approaching) We got some specials. \nShe BOLTS from the room; MIKE following her. \nMIKE (to the waiter) We'll be right back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nShe weaves toward the car.  MIKE goes after her. \nMIKE Let me drive... \nELLIE Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.

Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me. \n", "test2_true": "She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding. \nELLIE (through her tears; screaming) You fucker!

PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING \nTRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to answer. \nMIKE Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a huge favor from you, man.  I know Helen doesn't like you to miss dinner, but I need you to switch shifts with me tonight. (a beat) Just \"personal\".  I don't know what the hell I'm doin', I need some time to think. (angered) Look, do it or don't do it, but spare me the fuckin' lecture, all right? \nHe HANGS UP:  miserable. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING \nA SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS, as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as he LOPES INTO THE PARK. \nANOTHER ANGLE:  as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's \"RED\"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into the park.  A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open, engulfing our sight of him... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER \nThe \"JOGGER\" returning, obscuring his identity from the parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel. Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard, he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING. \nIt's happening:  A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL, distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for the \"JOGGER\" to SLIP BY, making it inside. \nDOORMAN I know sweetheart... we have enough flowers here. \nANGLE:  VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting. \nDOORMAN No, no, sweetheart... not here... get going... Okay. \nANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER slip by and her mission accomplished. \nVIETNAMESE GIRL (sweetly, to Doorman) Have a nice day. \nTHE GIRL:  slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she skips off. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BUILDING LOBBY - SAME \nThe \"JOGGER,\" his face still obscured by the towel waits for the elevator, as T.J., arriving, ENTERS the building. They both enter the elevator in silence. \nANGLE on T.J. glancing at the JOGGER quizzically.  The JOGGER avoids his stare, CAMERA TILTING UP to the indicator, beginning to rise. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SPARKS' VESTIBULE \nCLOSE ON \"JOGGER'S\" key, entering the LOCK.  IT TURNS. \nCLOSE ON HIS FACE.  He ENTERS. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME \nAs the killer closes the door.  He's in the kitchen.  All is quiet in there. \nIN CLOSEUPS, WE SEE his JOGGING SHIRT coming off, revealing a shoulder holster; a specially designed \"belt\" removed and laid on the kitchen table.  A \"SILENCER\" within. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING \nCLAIRE eagerly and earnestly preparing dinner.  She makes some fluffs, not really used to this.  CLASSICAL MUSIC plays.  She looks up expectantly, hearing the FOOTSTEPS. \nCLOSE ON CLAIRE:  surprised to see it's T.J. \nT.J. Detective Keegan is... Mike... \"Michael\" asked me to tell you he's under the weather. \nCLAIRE:  She handles it, crestfallen. \nT.J. He'll probably take the morning shift. \n", "test2_id": 2044, "test3_input": "INT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT \nMIKE I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door. \nVENZA I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so. \nMIKE Let my kid go. \nVENZA I'm not lettin' no one go. \nMIKE Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table! \nVENZA Don't you fuckin' give orders to me... \nMIKE Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in. \nMIKE turns to the window, about to shout. \nVENZA (to Tommy, an order) Under the table. \nMIKE I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head. \nMIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE. \nANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE \"beneath the table\". \nCLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his back; emitting a whimper of terror. \nELLIE Be careful, Tommy. \nHE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD. \nThe FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway. \nMIKE (frantic) Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your step.  Come slowly. \nANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his head.  It's impossible. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under the TABLE. \nANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL. \nANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about to STEP INTO THE LIGHT. \nMIKE Watch your step! \nVENZA (rising) What the fuck you doin'?! \nTOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN. \nMIKE There's a skateboard in the door! \nWith a sudden SOUND of TAPE \"RIPPING\" from under the TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR, rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE. \nANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS \"PINGING\" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE. The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES like the Fourth of July, mixed with the \"WHINE\" of bullets hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling through the dark. \nThe \"FIGURE AT THE DOOR\" is firing with both hands, SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down, wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two hands tied in front of her. \nELLIE (to Tommy) Stay down! \nThe ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA, trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW... \nMIKE Turn around, fuck! \nHe DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the \"FIGURE\" in the door, SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down. \nAnd then all is quiet. \nINSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly ceased; everyone is a state of shock. \nELLIE (desperate) Tommy...! \nTOMMY I'm all right. \nMIKE Ellie... \nELLIE I'm all right. \nThe overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the \"FIGURE\" in the doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS. Guns in both hands, still smoking. \nKOONTZ (emphatic) Fuckin' miracle, man. \nIn the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward. The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE, TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place. Listening to them come. \n", "test3_true": "The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the floor. \nOTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all are safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of something else in her eyes. \nCLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family wrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting her eyes. \nCLAIRE Everyone's all right...? \nMIKE Yeah.  It's all over. \nLONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary details, in the aftermath of the crisis. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME \nThe LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes, AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away. \nCAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in the distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the police overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye. \nCLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say. \nMIKE So. \nCLAIRE So. \nANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's. \nMIKE You still going away? \nCLAIRE I don't know... \nMIKE You don't have to, now. \nCLAIRE I think it's probably still a good idea. \nCLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message. \nMIKE Yeah... \nBoth are hurting. \nCLAIRE (heartfelt) I'll miss you, Mike. \nMIKE Listen, I'll... see you again. \nHer eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile. But he can't quiet manage it. \nCLAIRE (barely able to speak) Say goodbye. \nHe struggles with it; unable. \nMIKE I like your coat. \nCLAIRE (half-laugh, half-cry) You have a weakness for Lady Cops. \nMIKE I do. \nSilence now; their eyes adoring. \nCLAIRE Say goodbye, Mike. \nMIKE (thick voiced) You take care. \nMIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER. They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative greeting. \nMIKE (finally) What do you think? (a beat) Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this. \nGARBER (noncommittal) Call me next week.  We'll talk about it. \nMIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS TOWARD. \nANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands beside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and tousles TOMMY'S hair. \nMIKE Good police work, kiddo. \nHe catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other. \nELLIE (re: Tommy) He doesn't want to sleep here. (a long beat) Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore. \nMIKE Me neither. \nANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes. \n", "test3_id": 2045}

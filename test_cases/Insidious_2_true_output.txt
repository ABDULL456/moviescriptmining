LONG HAIRED MAN I hear you... 
He approaches. 
LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D) I hear you, but you don't know what you've done. 
He licks his lips. 
LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D) There is a place that you can't go to and this is that place. 
He is only a few yards from Josh now. He SCREAMS with awesome power, his spit flying. 
LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D) YOU MADE A MISTAKE!! I'M GOING TO MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING FOR YOU! I'M GOING TO RIP YOU APART YOU CUNT!! 
He CHARGES at Josh, screaming with hellfire fury. 
Josh recoils, falling onto the floor, screaming. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD 
Josh's body JOLTS in the chair and he makes a noise somewhere between a scream and a moan. 
RENAI What's happening to him?! 
Elise leans in, attempting to communicate with Josh. 
ELISE You're stronger then they are, Josh. You are a living soul! 
INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER 
Josh struggles. The Long Haired Man attacks him viciously. 
Then something changes in Josh - he gets angry. 
JOSH Get...off..me! 
He shoves the Long Haired Man back, pounding into him with the strength of TEN MEN. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Get away from me! Leave now! 
Frightened, the Long Haired Man retreats, backing away until he is swallowed up by the blackness. 
JOSH (CONT'D) Dalton!! 
DALTON (O.S.) (STILL DISTANT) I'm here... 
Josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this Escher- like maze of passageways. 
JOSH Dalton! 
DALTON (O.S.) Here... 
INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
From darkness into baroque extravagance. 
Josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected opulence...as if a palace had been stormed, the occupants murdered and the place left to rot. 
Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest having rotted way. 
Mirrors line the walls, their surface too clouded to see into. 
JOSH Dalton...? 
He weaves between pillars, finally coming across a figure, slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog. 
It is Dalton. 
Josh runs to him. His foot is chained to a PIPE behind him, the clamp binding his right ankle. He looks pale and sick. He looks like one of them. 
JOSH (CONT'D) I'm taking you back. 
He sees that Dalton is terrified. Looking over Josh's shoulder. 
JOSH (CONT'D) What is it? 
He glances back, spotting an open door at the end of the ballroom, light spilling from within it. 
There is somebody inside. 
INT. MAKE-UP ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS 
A grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold-rimmed mirror at a baroque powder table. 
It is the RED-FACED creature seen by Elise.

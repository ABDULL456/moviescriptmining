GWEN Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?

TREVOR That was cold... 
GWEN No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold. 
This goes through Trevor like a shot. EIGHT MONTHS! 
Here we go- Dolly in zoom out! In Close up of Trevor we... 
FLASHBACK 
QUICK FLASHES of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind. Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as one of the characters. 
GWEN (cont'd) Yeah, Trevor thats it. Thats it. 
And back in the real world, Trevor is now locking lips with a very ready Gwen. His hand is up her skirt. He stops abruptly and pulls back. 
TREVOR I'm sorry Gwen. I don't know what's happening to me. (zipping up) I think it's the painkillers, really. 
Gwen rolls her eyes. She re-adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy. She's heard this one before. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) They mess with my head. Yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor. Like the accident just happened you know? 
Gwen softens up. Trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable. 
GWEN Why don't you let me take you out tonight? I promise to make it the most memorable night of your life. 
She kisses him. He braces himself. She grabs his butt, then goes for the door.

GWEN (CONT'D) Pick you up round seven. And Gooding? Get some fucking work done. 
INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY 
Trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. He pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. A PING from his computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO- FILE ATTACHED. Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks. 
Up comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now. 
TREVOR'S PHONE RINGS. Startleing him(and us). He picks it up. 
TREVOR (into phone) You got Trevor. 
MAN'S VOICE (from phone) Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from homicide. It's about your wife. 
Push in on to a bewildered Trevor. 
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE, HOMICIDE - DAY 
It is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk. 
Trevor sits across from him. Behind Trevor is another empty desk. 
As Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often. 
LANGE (to Trevor) Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now? 
TREVOR Where's my wife? 
LANGE Okay then. Here's the scoop. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks. 
LANGE (CONT'D) (cont'd) We still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river. And missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play.

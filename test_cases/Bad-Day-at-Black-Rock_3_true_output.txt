MACREEDY (to Smith) Wouldn't it be easier if you just waited till I turned my back? (looking toward the loafers at the bar, then back at Smith) Or are there too many witnesses present? 
Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife. The are only three feet apart. Smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes inside over the outline of a pistol. Sam glances from Macreedy to Smith to the unconscious Coley. He sidles toward the door and runs out fast. (NOTE: From this point to end of scene INTERCUT from Macreedy and Smith to exploit the reactions of the loafers at the bar.) 
SMITH (with effortless ferocity) You're still in trouble. 
MACREEDY So are you. (Smith snorts) Whatever happens -- you're lost. 
SMITH You got things a bit twisted... 
MACREEDY You killed Komako. Sooner or later you'll go up for it. Not because you killed him -- in this town you probably could have gotten away with it -- but because you didn't even have the guts to do it alone. You put your trust in guys like him... (gesturing toward the unconscious Coley) ...and Hector -- they're not the most dependable of God's creatures. Sooner or later they'll get the idea you're playing them for saps. What'll you do then -- peel them off, one by one? And in the meantime if any one of them breaks, you'll go down hard. Because they got something on you. Something to use when things get tough. 
With a quick motion, he tosses the knife to Smith. Smith catches it. 
MACREEDY And they're getting tougher every minute. 
He walks past Smith and goes out the door. Self-consciously holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the bar. They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls. The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, who carries his little black medical bag. Doc looks at Coley. 
DOC (softly, full of awe) Man... man-oh-man. 
He goes to Coley, bending down over him. Smith has remained motionless as a monument. Now he doubles shut the knife in his hand. He pockets it, and without even glancing at Coley, turns quickly and goes out. 
QUICK DISSOLVE: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY 
Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs. He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at the clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He works hard and with some concentration, removing the other. Then he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggles his toes -- watching them with some interest. 
The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops. The sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the one- arm bandit. They follow his gaze up the steps. 
STAIRWAY - MACREEDY 
walks down, carrying his suitcase. He goes to Pete at the clerk's desk. 
MACREEDY Anything for me? 
PETE Nothing. 
MACREEDY Any message -- a telegram? 
PETE (returning to his cards) Nothing. 
As Macreedy turns from the desk, Doc joins him. 
DOC (to Macreedy, shrilly, gruffly) In case you're interested, Coley'll live. (glaring at Smith and Hector) I'm truly sorry to say. 
Smith coolly continues to read his paper. It is Hector who turns toward Doc... 
HECTOR (to Doc, jerking a fat hand toward Macreedy) Your friend's pretty tough. 
DOC Yeah. He's wicked. He defends himself when he's attacked. 
Macreedy ignores the exchange of words. He walks across the frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it. Doc, who has followed him, stands looking down at Macreedy for a long moment. Then... 
DOC (with some irritation) Well...? You going to just sit here and let time run out? 
MACREEDY I'm waiting for a wire. From the state cops. 
DOC You sent it through Hastings? (an audible sigh) Just don't expect an answer, if that's the way you sent it. 
MACREEDY (looking toward the door) No? (he rises) 
Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and looks around. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He walks rigidly in an arc past Macreedy to Smith. He holds out a Postal Telegraph form. Smith puts down his paper and takes it. Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith. Tim in his stockinged feet joins them.

"ILIA" To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.

just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open disapproval. 
SCOTT Well, sir, now what about all that? A living entity, the Captain says... entity... A living thing...! 
Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia," attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly: 
DECKER Thank you, Scotty... 
He moves to leave. 
SCOTT (dourly) Your welcome, sir. 
Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz- ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns and looks back at the engine room. She addresses Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear: 
"ILIA" There is no logical reason for carbon units to control Enterprise's power systems. 
SCOTT (to "Ilia") Lassie, if I were functioning 'logically,' right now I'd be showing you the inside of our scrap metal compactor! 
327   INT. BRIDGE                                                327 
Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky, is clearly more alert. They are just assuming their stations. 
UHURA We're now locked into Starfleet's transceivers; Admiral Nogura has received your reports, sir. 
328   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 328 
Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi- nously in orbit over Earth. 
UHURA The visual is a lunar monitor relay, sir. 
As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN. (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference some-times seen on the television screen.) 
UHURA (continuing) Heavy interference, sir -- it's coming from here, inside the intruder itself... 
Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from his console, listens to it. 
SPOCK Puzzling! The interference appears to be a rather simple carrier wave code signal... 
UHURA On an old style radio frequency, sir... 
329   PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR                                  329 
as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear. All eyes go to them as: 
"ILIA" (to Decker; interrupting) As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator. 
DECKER (nods; turns to Kirk) V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect... 
"ILIA" 'To learn all that is learnable.' 
DECKER (to Kirk) It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator. 
UHURA (whirling) Sir! V'ger's signals have stopped... 
"ILIA" (as if frightened) Decker... The Creator has not responded. 
Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but Uhura interrupts: 
UHURA Picking up Starfleet again; a lunar monitor relay... 
330   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 330 
as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.) 
McCOY My God! They're the same kind of things that destroyed the Klingons, Epsilon Nine... 
SPOCK (interrupting; from science console) These read as identical composition... (turns to Kirk) ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful! 
KIRK High mag, Mr. Sulu! 
Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI- FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES more clearly. 
SULU The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming... 
UHURA (overlapping) Urgent signal from Starfleet, Captain! (turns, shaken) All Earth defense systems have gone dead. 
Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message. 
UHURA (continuing) Sir, Starfleet computes their trajectories as moving toward equidistant positions over Earth. 
331   ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK                             331 
exchanging significant glances.

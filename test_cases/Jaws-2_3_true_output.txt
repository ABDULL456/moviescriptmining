ANDY Can you sail? 
POLO (testing his rudder) Yeah! We'll take him in! 
He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a severe, but manageable tack. Polo, Timmy, and the injured Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind. 
Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. Jackie is strangely quiet; things are out of control... 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON A NAUTICAL CHART - DAY 
clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable Junction. Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of his course. It fumbles, pauses, stops. 
ABOARD THE POLICE BOAT - DAY 
Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean. Ahead is the Lighthouse, his immediate destination. Out of sight to the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of cold Atlantic. Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the radio. 
BRODY (on radio) Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you? 
CHOPPER PILOT (V.O.) (filter) This is Air One. That you, Brody? 
BRODY It's me. Any fix on those Kids? 
PILOT (V.O.) Negative. I'm still down. 
BRODY For Christ's sake, get going! I'm all alone out here! 
PILOT (V.O.) Brody, I got to switch frequencies, call my boss. We'll meet you over by Francis Shoal. Harbor Air out... 
BRODY Where the hell is Francis Shoal? 
Static. No answer. Brody realizes something 
BRODY I'm all alone out here. 
RUNBY The Amity Police Boat, under full power, surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm. 
EXT. OCEAN, NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY 
We can see Brody's boat approaching. It slows as it nears the island. 
CLOSE ON BRODY 
staring, perplexed. Which way? 
BRODY Shit. 
He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left -- the wrong way. 
ANGLE ON THE BOAT, LIGHTHOUSE IN B.G. 
It barrels off to the left. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE RAFTED BOATS 
floating in the current, drifting away from the lighthouse, towards the open sea. Floating on the wreckage and tangled boats are:  Doug, Andy, Jackie, Patrick, Lucy, Larry, Bob, Brooke, Marge, and Sean. 
LARRY Anyone know what time it is? 
DOUG 
MARGE Damn! 
Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy (the practiced sailors) ad lib equal dissatisfaction. 
JACKIE What's wrong? 
BROOKE Tide doesn't turn for three hours. 
DOUG Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m. 
ANDY What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables? 
DOUG I can't help it, it sticks in my mind. 
BROOKE (making light of it) Anyone want to play charades? 
No one does. 
PATRICK As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow. 
ANDY Not funny. 
PATRICK Three knot current? 
LUCY At least. And an offshore wind. 
SEAN What's after Cable Junction? 
BOB The Atlantic. Then Ireland. 
JACKIE Can't we stop? 
Silence from the group. 
BROOKE They're probably looking for us. 
DOUG What about the fish? 
LARRY Maybe it's gone. 
DOUG They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy. 
They consider this. 
BROOKE So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait.

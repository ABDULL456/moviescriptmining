He sees mountains. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have always loved mountains. 
He is handed a steaming cup of tea. 
And then, a cloud passes over the moon. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT 
On horse back, the party makes its way up a mountain pass. 
There are more members now - Tenzin Gyatso has joined those who left ahead of him - members of the Kashag, tutors, his Mother, his Brother. 
It is tough going.  The ground seems like quick sand with every step a struggle.  When the horses have disappeared from sight, a sand storm arises, wiping away their tracks. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  NIGHT 
The party passes above an encampment of Chinese soldiers. They are not seen. 
EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE  DAY 
The party travels through the emptiness. 
EXT.  MOUNTAIN PASS  DUSK 
His Holiness walks beside his horse. 
He joins other members of the group standing on a ridge. 
Tenzin Gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side. 
TENZIN GYATSO "Right will be victorious." 
And now, the others do the same.  The Lord Chamberlain says: 
LORD CHAMBERLAIN "The Gods will be avenged!" 
EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF TIBET  DAY 
The Dalai Lama sits before a low table set up on this desolate border. 
A document is before him. 
TENZIN GYATSO I repudiate the Seventeen Point Agreement 
With a slap of the State Seal of Tibet, this is done. 
The Lord Chamberlain removes this document and replaces it with another. 
TENZIN GYATSO I constitute the Government of Tibet, the only legal authority in the land. 
The seal comes down hard once more.  It is done. 
EXT.  BORDER  DAY 
A sick and tired Tenzin Gyatso makes the last leg of his trip on the back of a black yak. 
Before him, through the light rain, we see a small bamboo arch erected in the middle of nowhere.  Six Indian GHURKAS, wearing floppy, jungle hats and heavy, British boots, stand at attention. 
The Dalai Lama, on his black yak, passes under this babboo gateway as the Indian Soldiers raise their guns in salute. 
An Indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man from his mount. 
Tenzin Gyatso stands, barely able to hold himself on his feet.  His hand rests on the yak's back. 
The Indian soldier steps closer and, knowing he is breaking protocol, he whispers: 
SOLDIER With all respect, may I ask? Who are you? 
The young man smiles at the Soldier - a man who looks like the lead soldier come alive. 
TENZIN GYATSO What you see before you is a man.  A simple monk. 
SOLDIER Are you the Lord Buddha? 
Pause. 
TENZIN GYATSO I think I am a reflection, like the moon, on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, see yourself 
INT.  A ROOM IN INDIA, FOOT OF THE HIMALAYAS  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso unpacks.  He is dressed in maroon robes, his arms bare. 
He places some books on a table next to his tinkering equipment.  He lifts a heavy parcel. 
EXT.  TERRACE  DAY

{"test1_input": "We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane, drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane gestures to Scott, meaning, \"Shall we begin?\" Scott hesitates for a moment, and then nods. \nFOCUS. \nANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to address the two candidates. \nBLANE (over his shoulder, to an Aide) ...would you bolt the door, please...? \nScott gestures to the Aide, \"One Moment\". \nBLANE (to the candidates) ...are you tired, Gentlemen? (the two young men smile) This is the completion of the evolution: (beat) Only one of you may join the unit. The first man through that door will be inducted. \nHe gestures at a far door in the room. \nANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get the picture. \nBeat. \nSCOTT (to himself, quietly) ...yeah...you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'... \nCU Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing them, as  they look at each other. Beat.   Grossler starts to advance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch.   Scott gestures to the Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see. \nThe Aide lets Scott out of the back door. \nEXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY. \nScott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow duffle-bag. He opens the trunk. \nHe takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the direction of Scott. \nDRILL INSTRUCTOR (to that man) What the hell are you looking at? There ain't nobody there... \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK. \nA young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high chainlink fence topped with barbed wire. \nANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open. \nWe see a sign \"McGarrity Construction Company\" on the gate. \nThe young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles, and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone quickly. \nYOUNG WORKER (into phone) ...Frontgate... \nWe see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad. \nINT. MUSTANG. DAY. \nScott, driving, comes around a bend. \nANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road giving a \"Stop\" signal to the car. \nANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop, and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott takes the paper and begins to read. \nHe looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see the worker begin to respond, his body language saying \"That's all I know.\" As he starts to speak his words are drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up. \nANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low. \nANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy we see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The helicopter goes into a tight turn. \nANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn, and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away. \nANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: \"All hands.\" Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving directions about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he retrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker, and takes off, running, to the helicopter. \nANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the helicopter takes off. \nANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear. \nINT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT. \nScott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles River and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake. \nANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a football stadium. A black suburban is waiting. \nEXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT. \nSeen through the windshield of a car. \nANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main entrance. \nScott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban, and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large, paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads \"Temporarily Closed For Repairs\". \n", "test1_true": "An older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards that Scott is to be admitted, that he is \"okay\". Miller gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the boathouse. We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the Charles River beyond. \nANGLE on Scott. As Scott looks through the papers. Around him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled. \nANGLE INSERT. The top sheet shows a color photo of a phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens. As Scott talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand. One is a print of a glossy magazine article. \nSCOTT (of the photo, nodding to himself, as he reads) \"...Betty Coed, has hair of red for Harvard...\" \nAIDE (of the top photo) It's not current. \nSCOTT Why not...? \nANGLE on them as they arrive at a small equipment room. Through the door we see a young government type, Gaines, his suitcoat off, his shoulder holster empty, being interrogated by several colleagues. \nAIDE It seems she got a makeover today. We're working on it. \nHe hands a small log book to Scott, and points to an entry. Scott looks down the entries, and glances up, now and then, at the man being interrogated. \nSCOTT (reads) 4PM. Cut n'Curl... \nAIDE Gave her a crewcut, dyed it platinum blonde... \nSCOTT (glancing up at the man in the chair) Met with her boyfriend at ten. Then...? \nThe Aide shrugs, meaning, \"That's it...\" \nSCOTT ...he's on Post until he turned her over to the Nightwatch...? \nAIDE He says he was... \nSCOTT Who else you got...? \nMiller gestures to an associate, who comes forward, passing photos to Scott, as Miller goes to look through the glass at the young man being interrogated. \nAIDE ...we got the boyfriend, Michael Blake. \nSCOTT ...where is he...? \nWe are shown a photo of an Ivy League preppy chap around 18. He is on a sailboat. \nAIDE Was not in his dorm last night, we're shaking the trees...And... (Scott is passed another photo) Professor Gerald Sloane, notably chummy with his female students, of which she was one. Weekend home, Martha's Vineyard... \nSCOTT ...for sure...? \nAIDE Been there since Friday. \nWe see a photo, obviously from a school catalogue, of a youngish bearded man, in front of a blackboard. We see Miller in the BG finish his meeting and turn to the group. \nMILLER I'm light. I'm light, people...I need another team on the Professor, I need an overwatch on the boyfriend... \nThe Aide hands him a sheet of paper, obviously a roster. \nScott, looking at the board. He puts down his head for a moment, and blinks his eyes, trying to clear his head. \nMILLER You just come from the Cadre. \nSCOTT Yes sir. \nMILLER How long since you've slept? \nSCOTT Not significant. \nMILLER You take a team, and Bulldog. Are you up for it? \nSCOTT (absently, as he looks over the materials he has been given) Sir, \"this Marine pisses av gas and farts blackpowder, Sir.\" \nMILLER Thank you for coming, Bobby. \nSCOTT Are you kidding, sir...? \nAn Associate comes over and hands him a piece of paper. Miller shakes his head. \nMILLER I don't have the bodies. Call em in...call em in... \nANGLE on Scott. CU. As he watches the interrogation of Gaines in the next room. The young man begins to pick up his coffee cup, and we see that it shakes. \nANGLE on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head. The young man tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently, down his shirtfront. Scott exchanges a glance with Miller, and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation. \nThe man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is in his early thirties. He is sweating and obviously frightened. An Aide comes and stands by Scott. \nAIDE (whispering) His post was Harvard Yard. Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell House, across from her dorm. Nightwatch relieved him there, Midnight... \n", "test1_id": 2613, "test2_input": "BLAKE We broke up. Alright? Laura Newton.

NIGHT. \nBlake and Scott, as they walk up to a door. Scott knocks on the door. \nSCOTT ...Mzz Newton...? (pause) Mz Newton...this is Campus Security... \nHe begins to fumble with keys at his belt. \nANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Several agents, obviously involved in investigating the room, wearing plastic gloves, stop. One, silently, unlocks the door. \nWe   see Scott enter the room, \"miming\" using a key, and turn on   the light and look inside. We take him to her desk, where he   finds several photos of her and her father - and a note on   he desk, reading \"Dear Dad-Thanks for coming-signed %-)\". \nWe see the boy, Blake, out in the corridor, unable to see into the room. \nSCOTT Mz Newton...? (pause) \nANGLE, in the hall, as Scott and Blake stand there, a young girl comes down the hall and stops, opposite her room. \nYOUNG GIRL Hey, Mike. Sprised to see you there. (smiles) That was some Vicious Performance... \nShe smiles brightly and goes into her room. Scott looks at Blake. \nEXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT. \nBlake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard. Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see this symbol %-) and begin to read: \"This is a sham. Your view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt. You cunt. And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you...\" \nBLAKE ...I was just...trying to retrieve the letter. \nANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the letter. \nSCOTT ...this is not very nice language.

Where we see a Secret Service type. Through the windshield we see Scott gesture \"Do Not Intervene.\" \nANGLE, on Scott and Blake, as they walk down the near- deserted Mass Ave. \nSCOTT (of the sign on the letter,the \"Picasso\" sign, that is %-}. He turns the sign rightside up to show it is a 'cockeyed smile') What is this sign? \nBLAKE It's how she signs her letters.

Blake and Scott. \nSCOTT I know that nothing hurts worse than that. She seeing another guy...? \nBLAKE I...

From inside the windshield of the van we see, through their body language, that Scott is \"giving the boy a break\", the boy is very thankful. Scott is admonishing him and the boy is contrite. Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the van pick up a phone and speak softly into it. \nANGLE, Scott, walking down a sidestreet. The boy in the BG, we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb. And Scott gets in. \nANGLE, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes, beyond exhaustion. The car pulls away. \nHe gives several instructions to the young man driving, and then leans back, eyes closed. He opens his eyes again, and we see him mouth, insistently, \"The Regency\". The driver nods. \nINT. BOATHOUSE. NIGHT. \nAs Scott enters. The activity is more widespread than previously. An agent walks him into the fray. \nAGENT No morgue. No hospital. No note. \nSCOTT The parents? \nAgent, nods, shrugs. \nAGENT The mother, (makes a \"drinking\" gesture) You know where she is...He's holding up... (as an afterthought) He was in town yesterday. To see her. \nSCOTT (as he shakes his head - to clear it) He was? \nAGENT ...we snuck him in, and out. \nWe see Miller, in the BG, in a hurried conference, nod at Scott. \nMILLER (looking at a chart) \"The Colophon - 36-foot sloop\". Where is she...? \nThey walk off, an Aide talking to him. \nAIDE ...the Coast Guard has a watch over this area: (he points to the chart) And they have scheduled the Colophon first... \nScott and the Agent stop in front of the interrogation room, where we see the agent, Gaines, a guard over him. Gaines is sitting, looking as if he had been weeping. The guard addresses Scott and the other agent. \nGUARD He copped to it. \nSCOTT He copped to what? \nGUARD (of Gaines) Off-post - punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend. \nScott shakes his head as if to say \"How about that...\" The agent holds a photo of a very lovely Eurasian woman in a business suit, and shows it to Scott. \nAGENT Hope she was worth it... \nSCOTT Uh huh. \nScott stands wearily, watching several large men berating the seated Secret Service Agent. An agent appears with a tearsheet showing the ad for \"The Regency Club\". We see the ad for exotic young companions, and the address is Boston. Scott gives instructions to the Aide. \nANGLE INT. WASHROOM. Scott, having stripped off his shirt, is washing himself at the sink. The \"Regency\" ad, and a description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror before him. We read, in the mirror: \"REGENCY. 243 Charles Street, Boston, Mass. Owners of Record...\" Et Cetera. In the mirror we see the Aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to Scott. Scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the BG, ANTON, just entering the establishment. \nANGLE INT. THE BOATHOUSE. A Swat team is laying out its weapons and assault gear, on a long table. \n", "test2_id": 2614, "test3_input": "ANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on the outskirts of the square. \nANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks at his watch, and he looks up. \nANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far side of the square, toward the phone booth. \nANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds toward the phone booth. \nAs Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads toward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward another car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton, and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away. \nANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on, aghast. \nANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as the car disappears. \nANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following, looking in the direction in which he was pointing. \nANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his POV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the shelf. \nHe looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around the interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the \"Rogers Rangers\" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down at it inquisitively. We read in an insert: \"Rule #11: Don't ever march home the same way. \nTake a different route, so you won't be ambushed.\" He then sees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a folded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up the envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope from the beach house. It is printed \"Hanson Marine - Everything For The Boat\", and we see, on it, the drawing of the old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it, tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs of Laura Newton. \nEXT. BOATHOUSE, ESSEX. DUSK. \nA wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of his jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking along the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling. The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it, blinking, and squinting. He turns his head. \nANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle dwelling, the small white toolshed. \nANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its proximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it. \nANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope. \nANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen- covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit of a sign. \nANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window, drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-). \nANGLE XCU Scott. \nSCOTT ...ohmigod... \nINT. SLEAZY HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT \nScott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty pint bottle of booze on the night stand. We hear the television on low, showing talking heads narrating the funeral of Laura Newton. \n\"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart\", et cetera. We see a photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings. Next to Scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same red crescent earring. \nANGLE, the line of light under the door to the hallway is occupied by a pair of feet. \nANGLE. A hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. Below it, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and several days worth of newspapers. \nANGLE XCU Scott, on the bed. Unshaven. We see his eyes come open. \nANGLE on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers card, on which we read: \"Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn - Dawn's when the French and Indians attack\", and comes up with an automatic pistol. \nANGLE the door, as we see the door handle move slightly. \nANGLE on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his side. \nANGLE HIS POV. In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy, holding a small paper bag, looking shocked. \nScott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and glances, both ways, down the hall. \nSCOTT What the hell are you doing? \nBELLBOY (showing the package) I...I brought you... \nSCOTT Why're you screwing with the door...? \nBELLBOY I...I... \nScott drags him into the room. \nSCOTT Why're you screwing with the door...? \nScott frisks him roughly. The terrified Bellboy shows a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, which he holds. \nBELLBOY I took the...I took the sign off... (pause) You had the sign on the door. F'they saw me...f'they saw me, knocking on a door, the sign on...they'd... (Scott relaxes somewhat. The Bellboy proffers the package) An, I...I figured, you needed...

Thanks. \nBELLBOY (begins to calm down a bit) ...I don't know why you... \n", "test3_true": "He begins to look through his pockets. As the Bellboy stands, looking at the television. \nANGLE on Scott, the television beyond him. As he goes through the pockets of his jeans. He then goes through the pockets of his jacket, and throws various objects on the bed. Some coins, some scraps of paper. A book of matches, some crumpled cigarettes. He hands some bills to the Bellboy. \nSCOTT There you go, Pal. Hold on... \nBELLBOY (pause) Sure. I just...I just wanted to help. \nANGLE, on Scott. As he rummages through the pile on the bed. The TV shows photos of Laura Newton, wearing her red crescent earrings. \nScott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed. \nPart of the pile shows a tabloid paper - a photo of   Laura, an insert of her father weeping at the funeral, and   the caption \"Goodbye, Baby\". He bends down and picks up   the Rogers Rangers card. And looks at it. He shakes his   head. As we see the Bellboy leave the room. Beat. \nINT. DARK, PANELLED CONFESSIONAL. NIGHT. \nXCU on Scott, as he thinks for a moment, then speaks. \nSCOTT It's been...quite a while since my last confession. That...that \"transpired\". On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack. (pause) And I confessed that I was frightened. (pause) And I have to confess, I'm frightened now. (pause. He smiles weakly) 'Nother \"irregular Confession\". \nHe raises a shotglass to his lips, and drinks. He makes a \"another one\" gesture. Pause. \nSCOTT ...I'm about as frightened as I'm comfortable being. (pause) And that's why...I involved you. (pause) Which, I suppose, was shameful. \nANGLE, as a waiter comes, with a fresh drink. We see that we are in a very dark, quiet, smoky, panelled bar. The waiter leaves, and reveals, beyond him, Jackie Black, the female Sergeant we met at the training facility scenes. The waiter looks at her, inquiring silently, if she wants anything. She shakes her head. \nJACKIE BLACK Now: you did me the honor to Call me. Now: you tell me how I might help. (pause) There in't nobody here, but two people in Green. (pause) \nScott, looks around, he takes up a tabloid newspaper, which has been resting on the seat of the booth. We see it is a \"funeral\" edition, concerning the death of Laura Newton. \nWe see the large, color photo of Laura, her red hair, and, in an insert, her father, at the gravesite, hiding his face. The caption reads \"Goodbye, Baby\". Scott leans over, and whispers to Black, his deepest secret. \nSCOTT (pointing at the paper) ...this girl's alive... \nJACKIE BLACK Then, you'd better go get her. \nEXT. SANITORIUM. DAY. \nScott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop. Reading a newspaper. Behind him, a large iron fence. \nANGLE INS. The newspaper shows \"The Tragic Death of Laura Newton\", and photos of the accident. And a photo of a distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends. \nANGLE on Scott. As he looks across the street. Surreptitiously. \nANGLE HIS POV. A plainclothes car, with two people in it, looking vaguely in his direction. \nANGLE on the bus, as it pulls into the stop. We see various people start onto the bus. At the last moment Scott, at the back of the line, sheers away. \nANGLE, INT. THE PLAINCLOTHES CAR. The bus pulling away from the bus stop, the chainlink fence beyond it, and, beyond that, a vaguely institutional-looking Colonial building. \nINT. SANITORIUM. DAY. \nA nurses station, Scott moving through the area, just asking directions of an older woman, obviously a semi-invalid. \nANGLE INT. SANITORIUM. The woman is Mrs. Newton. She walks with a companion, she wears sunglasses, and starts out of the sanitorium. As Scott walks up, some yards behind her, following her out onto a roofed porch. The woman moves to the far end of the porch, obviously weeping. Scott enters the porch, and stands for a moment. Beat. \nWOMAN (V.O.) ...terrible thing, grief... \nScott turns to her, to see a lovely woman in her late fifties, sitting on a lounge chair, a robe over her legs, indicating the weeping woman. \nScott nods, and takes something from his pocket. He starts toward the weeping woman, but the other woman holds him with her voice. \nWOMAN ...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how. (pause) I always think it's better to Leave Them Alone... \nScott nods his acceptance of her wisdom, and begins to start toward the woman. \nSCOTT (of Mrs. Newton, and the woman, talking to her) A relative? \nWOMAN A psychic. (pause) \nSCOTT Well. (pause) Can we blame her...? (he gestures, meaning, we get comfort where we can find it) \nWOMAN That's right. \nScott begins to move toward Mrs. Newton. The woman on the lounge chair sits up. \nWOMAN ...who are you...? \nSCOTT (moving off) United States Secret Service. \nThe woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds. \n", "test3_id": 2615}

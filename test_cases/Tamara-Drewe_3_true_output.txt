TAMARA Got to go. Sorry. She puts the phone down. 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 69. 
TAMARA I've just asked him to go and check over the farm - 
BEN Are you thick? 
TAMARA What? 
BEN Isn't it obvious who sent it? That tosser Andy Cobb. 
TAMARA He wouldn't do that. 
BEN Making himself all cosy in your house. Going through your stuff, prob'ly wearing your fucking pants - 
TAMARA No way! 
BEN Bet it was him that nicked my black T-shirt. 
TAMARA There is no way Andy would do that! Ben pulls his jacket on. 
BEN Well that says it all; the way you leap to his defence. 
TAMARA He hasn't done anything. 
BEN You know what? I know Fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me. 
TAMARA Ben - where are you going? Don't go! 
BEN Fuck's sake.

He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the sofa, shocked. 
BEN (CONT'D) 
(WITHOUT APOLOGY) I'm taking the dog for a crap. He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's dread overwhelms her. 
106 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 106 
Poppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is folding sheets. 
POPPY Oh come on mum. She's just stirring shit. Tamara's always done that. 
BETH Why's your father on there - and poor Andy? It's so tasteless. 
POPPY (helping with the sheets) You know how subversive she is. She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it. It's her sense of humour; she likes causing trouble. At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift. 
BETH She taught you to shoplift? 
POPPY Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant. Why would she look at an old git like dad? Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest. Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table. Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious. 
106A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S SHED (LIMBURY). 106A 
Nicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf. Andy is outside his shed, doing heavy work. 
NICHOLAS What did you make of that email from Tamara? 
GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70A. 
ANDY It don't make any sense. Her London boyfriend's trying to fuck her up; that's my theory. Andy carries on working. 
ANDY (CONT'D) She could do so much better. Nicholas walks on. 
NICHOLAS 
(TO HIMSELF) Couldn't agree more.

107 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER. 107 
Casey and Jody are pouring over a gossip mag; pictures of celebrity blonde with new man. 
CASEY How come she's with a different bloke every week and when Lesley Hunt's sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just once, after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag. 
JODY (Pointing at the blonde) That's cos she does it in five star resorts around the world - and not The Feathers carpark. Over the page, Ben canoodling in a freezing park with Fran. 
JODY It's Ben! 
CASEY `Who's the daddy? Steve Culley and Fran Redmond recently announced they were expecting. But in a Valentine tryst shocker Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant! Ben and Fran - we say Get A Room.' 
JODY He's back with Fran? After... 
CASEY After that email, Jode. 
JODY No way. No way! Tamara's car zooms past. Her expression is black. 
JODY (CONT'D) Omigod... what if she's dumped?

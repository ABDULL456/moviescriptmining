LINUS Man. I wasn't sure if I should say anything. Now I'm glad I did. 
DANNY So are we. 
RUSTY We're here to listen. 
(CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED: (3)                                               34 
LINUS Great. Thanks. Really. You won't regret this. 
Linus leaves. Danny and Rusty put their headphones back on. Now they look content. 
Basher and Frank watch Linus go. 
BASHER Tom. 
SAUL He can be a Tom? 
BASHER Anybody can be a Tom. 
SAUL You gotta make your own opportunities. This ain't a rehearsal. 
BASHER Tom. 
Saul chews his economy class trail mix. 
SAUL Boy, you're tough. 
BASHER Stop calling me "boy". 
Saul stops chewing. They look at each other. 
CUT TO:

Establishing shots of the city. 
36   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT -- DAY                               36 
The group makes their way down a damp cobblestone street. They stop in front of a window and look up. 
REVERSE ANGLE

36   CONTINUED:                                                   36 
They have stopped in front of a narrow townhouse that has been converted to a hotel. The sign says "Bellagio of Amsterdam." 
37   INT. BELLAGIO OF AMSTERDAM -- DAY                             37 
A single room with 12 bunks in it. Their noses are wrinkled up because the place stinks. 
LIVINGSTON How could he lie to us like that? 
RUSTY The sign said 'the Bellagio of Amsterdam'. 
Everyone looks at each other and turns to leave. 
LINUS (?) Wait a minute. That's it? 
DANNY Yeah. 
LINUS Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have. I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing? That we could use a little humility? That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job? Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn't what we deserve, but maybe it's what we need. We can do this. No, I take it back: We have to do this. 
A long beat. 
CUT TO: 
38   EXT. AMSTERDAM'S FINEST FIVE-STAR HOTEL                       38 
Four black mercedes skid to a stop outside Amsterdam's finest five-star hotel.

Everyone emerges with big smiles on their faces. Everyone except Linus. He scowls, yanks his bag back from the hotel doorman who rushed over to take it for him. 
39   EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE, UNITED STATES -- DAY                 39 
Tess enters and buys a phone card. 
40   EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY                                      40 
Tess talks to Danny. Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN is parked. 
TESS What are you doing in Amsterdam? 
DANNY (PHONE V.O) Only what I have to do to get Benedict off our backs. 
TESS Be careful, Danny. Please. 
DANNY How's work? 
TESS It's the same. I'm distracted. 
DANNY I'm sorry. 
TESS It's not your fault.

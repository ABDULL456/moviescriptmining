HARVEY MILK Privacy's our enemy. You want real political power? Let's tell the truth for a change. Starting here. If there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... Do it. Now. 
ANNE KRONENBERG My folks know already. A beat. The room is silent. Dick looks ill. 
DICK PABICH I haven't told my father yet... 
HARVEY MILK (a beat, then) People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us. 
(BEAT) Cleve, show Dick where you keep your phone. 
CLEVE JONES It's in the bedroom. After a moment, Dick RISES and follows Cleve out of the room. People are stunned by Harvey's outrageous demand. Harvey sees Scott GLARING at him. 
93 EXT. CLEVE'S APARTMENT / STAIRCASE - LATER 
The meeting is breaking up, and Scott lets his NEW BOYFRIEND go ahead. Harvey ducks away from Jack and intercepts Scott. 
HARVEY MILK I thought you were done with politics.

SCOTT SMITH That's fucking insane. 
HARVEY MILK (re: Scott's new Boyfriend) Who's he? Do you live together? 
SCOTT SMITH Someone I'm seeing. He's good for me. He makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars... 
HARVEY MILK (quietly, so Jack doesn't hear) I miss you. 
SCOTT SMITH Oh, Harvey, don't... (eyeing Jack down the street) What's that about? 
JACK LIRA (calling out) Har-veyyyyy! 
HARVEY MILK He needs me. Scott nods. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN HARVEY'S ACHILLES HEAL. He walks away from Harvey, leaving him alone.

Dianne bangs her gavel like a mad woman. Harvey's adamant. 
HARVEY MILK DIANNE FEINSTEIN I have told no lies here Supervisor Milk, you will today or to Supervisor White come to order. in the past-- 
HARVEY MILK --I want it noted that I never promised to back moving any Mental Health Centers. I greatly respect Supervisor White, but I would like his remarks stricken. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN Duly noted. We will take a recess before recording the vote. Fellow Supervisor, CAROL RUTH SILVER, leans over to Harvey. 
CAROL RUTH SILVER Thank you, Harvey. Harvey is preoccupied with Dan approaching. He leans back.

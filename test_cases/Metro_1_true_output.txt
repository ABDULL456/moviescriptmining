Korda, fidgeting behind the woman impatiently, holds up his card... 
KORDA Listen, can I just sign outta here? 
WOMAN What do you mean, you don't know where he is?! You can't just lose somebody! 
JAIL GUARD #2 (to Korda) Who are you again? 
KORDA Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright? 
JAIL GUARD #2 Johnny who? 
WOMAN (to Korda) Can you believe these people? 
KORDA It's the criminal justice system. What can I tell ya? It's a mess. 
The guard shoves the sheet under the glass. 
JAIL GUARD #2 Alright, alright, just sign. 
Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and sticks it in the woman's coat pocket. 
KORDA If you find him, gimme a call. 
And Korda walks out. 
EXT. JAIL SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS 
It's a small parking area, with security gates on either end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then the second, and the third until... 
A VOICE (O.S.) Hey! 
Korda turns sharply to find the LATINO GUARD (guard #2), holding a clipboard, walking quickly toward him. 
JAIL GUARD #2 Hold on a second here. 
KORDA Is there a problem? 
The guard walks up to him. They're standing between the cars. 
JAIL GUARD #2 You signed out twice. 
KORDA I what? 
JAIL GUARD #2 Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second. 
KORDA Wait a minute, lemme see that. 
As the guard shows him the sign-in sheet, Korda removes the PEN from his own clipboard. 
KORDA Well, that's funny, I wonder how that happened. 
In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars, drowning in his own blood.

INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Empty. New front door. Unpainted. Frame splintered from when Roper shot it open. We hold a beat... HEAR ROPER & RONNIE coming up the stairs. Laughing. The door opens. They enter. 
ROPER How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy. 
RONNIE In Europe women find older men very sexy. 
Roper closes the door. 
ROPER When I get old and fat, I'm moving to Europe. 
Ronnie suddenly remembers something. 
RONNIE I forgot to leave food for Paco. He's probably starving. 
She walks back toward the kitchen. Roper takes a seat on the couch. Flips on the TV. Rubs the back of his neck. 
ROPER Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie. 
FOLLOWING RONNIE 
She moves down the hall to the kitchen. 
RONNIE (doggie voice) I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot -- 
But Paco isn't lying on his pillow like she expected. Curious. 
RONNIE Paco? 
She turns around walks back down the hall... Where could he be?... She walks into the bedroom. 
RONNIE Paco? 
He's not in here either... She walks back into the hallway. Frowns. 
SUDDEN CUT 
A figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway!... Big scare. It's Paco. He nearly knocked her over. He stands on his hind legs, paws on her shoulders. Breathing in her face. 
RONNIE Paco, have you been eating my face soap, again? 
RACK FOCUS 
Roper standing at the other end of the hallway. Tense as a wire. Gun at his side. One look at his demeanor tells Ronnie something is very wrong. 
RONNIE (very concerned) What is it, Scottie?

CONTINUED: ROTTOVICH (cont' d) Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic. CUT TO: INT.- ANOTHER CAR- SAME Parked across the street and well hidden among the other parked cars... SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, a guy in his early 40's in the kind of suit you'd find on a "2--for-1" rack. He sits pointing a TELESCOPE MICROPHONE out the window, wearing headphones. He chews on gum loudly. ROTTOVICH (O.S. from headphones) Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit. SOBOZINSKI (O.S. from headphones) Whoa, whoa... There he is. We HEAR the SOUNDS OF CAR DOORS OPENING, then SLAMMING SHUT. Moonan puts down the mic and hits "STOP" on a microcassette recorder. MOONAN Confessions of a poor brusher. Moonan takes a second to remove his gum, then checks his teeth in the rearview mirror. CUT TO: EXT.- STREET/BROOKLYN- SAME Rottovich and Sobozinski walk quickly down the street. Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder. As he gets closer, we see that he's just a KID of about ten or eleven. Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid's hood. SOBOZINSKI You know who we are? KID The heat.

CONTINUED: Rottovich can't help smiling. ROTTOVICH That's right. We're the heat. (yelling) STICK `EM UP! The Kid jumps back startled and throws his hands up.       The cops share a laugh. ROTTOVICH Alright. Put your hands dawn. What do you got in the bag? KID Something for my Pops. ROTTOVICH I see. Well, your Pops has been making you carry around drugs for him. We're going to have to take them. The Kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack over. Rottovich opens it and pulls out TWO BRICKS OF HEROIN, wrapped in plastic. He nods to Sobozinski. The Kid stays rooted right where he is, looking up at the Detectives like a lost puppy. KID My Pops is going to be mad. ROTTOVICH Give the kid a twenty. Sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills for the kid who then sprints away. SOBOZINSKI What's the world coming to? Everybody's on the friggin' take... Rottovich and Sobozinski head off with the knapsack. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK-NIGHT (PRESENT) Butch and Jake... BUTCH Keeping the Fix happy.

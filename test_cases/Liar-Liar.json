So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me? \nFLETCHER I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise.

Audrey is headed to her car. \nFLETCHER Audrey, wait! \nAUDREY Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait. \nFLETCHER I can explain-- \nAUDREY I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab? \nFLETCHER Yes. \nAUDREY Where's your car? \nEXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING \nAudrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars. \nFLETCHER Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me. \nAUDREY I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents. \nFLETCHER Ow. \nAt this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) You scratched my car! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Where?     . \nFLETCHER Right there! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Oh that? That was already there. \nFLETCHER \n(OUTRAGED) Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this? \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE What? \nFLETCHER (angrier and \nANGRIER) ...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes. \nAUDREY Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out. \nFLETCHER Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation. \n. AUDREY What do you want to say? \nFLETCHER You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair. \nAUDREY Let' s define \"fair.\" Last \u00b7 night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair? \nFLETCHER Last night-- \n", "test1_true": "FLETCHER All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him. \nFLETCHER {CONT'D) I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk. \nAUDREY We're suppose to be on a plane \nTONIGHT-- \nFLETCHER No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too. \nAUDREY You're really coming? \nFLETCHER This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time? \nAUDREY ...Six? \nFLETCHER Ten-to-six. \nAU DR EY \n(UNSURE) All right... only if I tell Max you're coming and you don't show up and I have to see that look on Max's face -- that heartbreaking look-- it's Boston, Fletcher. \nFLETCHER. I will be there. \nAs Audrey gets in her car -- . \nAUDREY I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him. \nFLETCHER Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it! \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY \nFletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his arm. \nINT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS \nMs. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max brightens. \nMAX Dad! \nMS . BERRY Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms. Berry, Max's teacher! \nFLETCHER Hi. Listen, I need to talk to \nMAX-- \nMS. BERRY Mr. Reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers.

BERRY Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer. She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion. \nFLETCHER Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out. \nMS. BERRY One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe some of the children have \nQUESTIONS (hands shoot up) Jeffrey? \nJEFF What kind of lawyer are you? \nFLETCHER Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer. \nBILLY What's that? \n", "test1_id": 477, "test2_input": "FLETCHER C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question! \nFLETCHER Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes... \nFLETCHER Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole? \nFALK Yes. \nFLETCHER Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The \"not\" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise. \nFALK Excuse me? \nFLETCHER If I might rephrase your Honor.

I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said. \nFLETCHER (to himself) Thirty-one? \nJUDGE STEVENS Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport. \nJUDGE STEVENS (he's had it) Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of -- \nFLETCHER \nWAIT! \nSilence. \nFLETCHER      \u00b7. \n(DRAMATICALLY) Your Honor, I call Virginia Cole to the stand.

But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that? \nFLETCHER         \u00b7. Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it, \nF LETCHER Your driver's license. What color are your eyes? \nVIRGINIA Blue. \nFLETCHER Tru e blue?

What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? \nVIRGINIA \n(JOYFULLY) Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older.

(on a roll) My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR \nCAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL \nCONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL \nCONSENT INCLUDING-- \nDANA (defeated, to \nHERSELF) Prenuptual agreements. \nFLETCHER (knows he has \nTHEM) \nPRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed \u00b7 more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant.

For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million. \nFLETCHER He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? . \nVIRGINIA No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here.

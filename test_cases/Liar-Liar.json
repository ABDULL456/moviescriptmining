{"train": "LIAR LIAR \nWritten by \nTom Shadyac & Mike Binder \nRough draft, April 1996 \nINT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING \nTwo dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS. BERRY. The word \"Work\" is on the blackboard. \nMS. BERRY \"Work.\" Today we're going to share what our parents do for work. QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class: \nJEFF My dad is a truck driver. \nMELINDA My mommy is a doctor. \nCAROLYN My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian. \nTHEODORE (with difficulty) My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear. \nCRAIG     - My mother is an actress. She works at Denny's. \nKELLY My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy. \nELLIOT (looking a little \nCRAZED) My father is a postal worker. The QUICK CUTS end with MAX: \nMAX My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit: \nMS. BERRY And your dad? \nMAX \n(HESITANT) My dad? He's . . . a liar. \nMS. BERRY (taken aback) \nA liar? I don't think you mean \"a liar.\" \nMAX Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and-- \nMS. BERRY \n(RELIEVED) Oh! I see-- you mean he's a lawyer. \nMax shrugs. \nINT. COURTROOM .-- DAY \nFLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His manner is utterly genuine and convincing. \nFLETCHER A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM \nOUT: \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- (pointing at the old man) pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife? \nSuddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. The jurors RECOIL. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) \n(CONCERNED) As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help. First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a sigh of relief: \"Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!\" But do the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer! He walks along the jury box: \nHAIR) What do you think? \nFLETCHER Fabulous! I love it. (indicates the                     \u00b7 \nBASKET) What's this? \nJANE I don't know who sent it. But it's for Mr. Allan. It's his anniversary. \nFLETCHER Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday? \nJANE (as she goes) Yep... Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there \nMAX What are you doing? \nFLETCHER Oh, I'm... fixing the card, (shows him the old card) Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple. \nINT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON \n...Where a troubled FRED RAND is talking to MIRANDA, a beautiful, steely partner. \nFRED I can't do it. \nM IRANDA Fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible. \nFRED The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth. \nMIRANDA Let the Judge decide what's true. That's what he gets paid for. You get paid to win. \nFRED If you insist on my taking it to trial, I'll represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda -- I won't lie. Miranda looks out her window, calculating. \nMIRANDA Then we'll just have to find someone who'will. \nINT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON \nFletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out GREETINGS to his colleagues. \nFLETCHER Hey, Pete! Great tie!        \u00b7. Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him. \nFLETCHER Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's corpulent. \nTHOMAS Gained three pounds. \nFLETCHER (wedging past \nHIM) On you, it works. \nFletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA. \nGRETA ' M ax ! What's new? \n.MAX Well. . . it's my birthday tomo rrow. We're having a party and everything. Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten. \nGRE TA I'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful. Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max turns to him.     . \nMAX Yeah? \nFLETCHER Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second. \nMax heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) Damn!   I completely forgot. \nGRETA Oh, there's a surprise. Greta produces a wrapped GIFT. \nFLETCHER You're a saint. I should get you something. \nGRETA You did. She holds up another, smaller package. \nFLETCHER Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls? \nShe hands him a stack of mail. \nDOES) Thank you. (without looking \nUP) We are having some fun, eh Maxer? PUSH IN on Max; he isn't. \n\u00b7INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting.   She notices Jerry pacing. \nAUDREY Are you alright? \nJERRY Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone? \nAUDREY I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, (hangs up) \nJERRY \n(SUDDENLY) Will you marry me? She's SHOCKED. \nI \nAUDREY Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say? \nJERRY \n(NERVOUS) I proposed, I . . . Look, I know this Boston thing is a great opportunity, good job, mo ney .. . everything. But I started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and Max. And I didn't like it. I-- Look, I know it's a lot to ask, to move and everything, but I . . . . I love \nyou. I love your son.   Will you marry me? She stares at him, excited, but nervous. \nEXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nEarly morning outside Fletcher's building. \nINT. FLETCHER'S STUDY - MORNING \nFletcher types on his computer.   He's been up all night. He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES. \nFLETCHER Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty? \nMAX Five. \nFLETCHER Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... Fletcher produces -- \nFLETCHER . . . A present! . \nMax eyes it with wonder. \nMAX What is it? \nFLETCHER (no idea) It's... it's. (it hits him) a surprise. Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and \nFULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM. \nMAX Baseball stuff! \n_J \nFLETCHER Baseball stuff. \nMAX (hugging his dad) Will you play catch with me? \nFLETCHER            '\u00b7 \nAbsorootentootenlutely. Max beams. \nFLETCHER Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work. \nEXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING \nJerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of airline tickets. \nAUDR EY (re: tickets) Jerry, these are for tomorrow. \nFLETCHER After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of \nINDISCRETION-- \nVIRGINIA Seven. \nFLETCHER Hm? \nVIRGINIA Seven single acts of indiscretion. \nFLETCHER --Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for. \nVIRGINIA He is? \nFLETCHER Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- \nVIRGINIA Seven. \nFLETCHER (not missing a \nBEAT) --Seven .other men. You're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his. All you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. I think you're bending over backwards. \nVIRGINIA Well, I did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids... (to Miranda) He's always been a good father. \nFLETCHER And you've always been a good wife. \nVIRGINIA (getting worked \nUP) Yeah. . . \nFLETCHER There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. (takes her hand) Will you give me that opportunity? \nHe stares into her eyes. A moment, then... \nVIRGINIA Yes! I ' m tired of getting kicked around. \nFLETCHER Good for you! \nVIRGINIA Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves. Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door. She moves in on him. \nMIRANDA You're good. You're really good. \nFLETCHER Oh, pshaw. (pronounces it with the \"p\") She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket. \nMIRANDA N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you'll make partner. \n(STRAIGHTENING his tie) Actually, how would you like to make a partner right now? \nFLETCHER Excuse me? She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS. \nINT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up. \nCLOWN \n(SINGING) Captain Fuzzy is my name, Making children happy is my game, With a shake and a juggle, And a big belt buckle, You'll all be glad I came. ' He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch. \nAUDREY (indicating the \nCLOWN) What do you think? \nJERRY Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will? \nShe heads into... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJERRY They called me again from B oston. They really want me there tomorrow. \nAUDREY . . . I can't go to Boston. \nMAX (V.O.) I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15. \nCUT TO: A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are-- \nINT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nPAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is adorned with Fletcher's shoes... To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang... To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing... To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks-- \nMIRANDA S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH. \nFLETCHER I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF CLOTHES follow. The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants. A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . . \nINT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING \nAn alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With regret and wonder he remembers: \nFLETCHER \"I've had better?\" \nINT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING \nFletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in the mirror, mouth foaming. \nFLETCHER \"I've had better?!\" \nINT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nDressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator. \nFLETCHER (laughing it off) \"I've had better?\" I t arrives. He steps in. \nINT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING \nThe elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a beautiful young WOMAN. \nFLETCHER New in the building? \nMODEL I just moved in Monday. \nFLETCHER Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour. \nMODEL \n(SHE'S \nINTERESTED) O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants? \nFLETCHER No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and... \nINT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING \nWe HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face. \nEXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING \nA SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he is accosted by a BEGGAR. \nBEGGAR Any change, Mister? \n.FLETCHER Absolutely. But he continues walking. \nBEGGAR Could you spare some? \nFLETCHER Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled. \nBEGGAR Will you? \nFLETCHER No. \nJUDGE STEVENS Fine. \nVIRGINIA (aside, to \nFLETCHER) What are you doing? \nFLETCHER \n(WORRIED) \nI don't know. (to judge, with \nSOME \nDESPERATION) Your Honor, I ' d like a continuance! \nJUDGE STEVENS \" This case has already been delayed several times, Mr. Reid. \nFLETCHER I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance. \nJUDGE STEVENS I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem? \nFLETCHER'S P.O.V. \nThe ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then faster -- until we wind up squarely on -- \nFLETCHER'S FACE \nFLETCHER I can't lie! \nJUDGE STEVENS \n(IMPATIENT) Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm still waiting for the good caus e. Now, do you have it or . not? \n'            FLETCHER \n(TRUTHFUL) Not. \nJUDGE STEVENS Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case? \nDANA I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to -- \nFLETCHER \n(DESPERATE) \nSETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE! Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise. \nJUDGE STEVENS There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel. \nINT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING \nDana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge \nDANA Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband. \nJUDGE STEVENS Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid. \nFLETCHER It certainly does. \nDANA However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars. \nJUDGE STEVENS Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid. \nFLETCHER Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing. \nJUDGE STEVENS What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position? \nFLETCHER (utterly sincere) No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When \nattorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers. \n\u00b7 GRETA Hi, boss. What's happening \nWITH-- \nFLETCHER \nDON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE, \nPLEASE DON'T ASK! -- And races into his office. \nI NT . FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING \nHe leans against the door, trying to catch his breath. \nFLETCHER, \n(PACING) Do n't panic. You can beat this -- it's all a matter of willpower. He dives for his desk and rifles through it. \nFL ET CH ER A test. . . Something small... Aha! He holds up a BLUE PEN. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) Red.   Red. All right. Focus, (with great \nDELIBERATION) The color of this pen is \u00b7 r--. R--. R--! The color of this pen is--blue! AAAAHH! (burying his \nHEAD) Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I can't say it!! \n(suddenly sitting \nUP) ' I'll write.it! He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes \"This pen i s . . . \" He tries to write an \"R\" but can't. He STRAINS. S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote \nINADVERTENTLY: \"This pen is blue.\" \nF LE TC HE R \nNO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! ! Greta enters to find-- FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air. \nGRETA Boss, what's wrong? \nFLETCHER . The pen is blue!! The pen is     . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS \nBLUE !!! Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment -- then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen. \nGRETA Red? \nFLETCHER \n(BITTER) Oh, that's easy for you to say?! \nGRETA Are you all right? \nFLETCHER (getting up) I have to go home. \nGRETA Home? Was the case settled? \nFLETCHER No. I have to be in court at one-thirty. \nGRETA Well, then how can you.go home? \nFLETCHER I don't know, I don't know!!! \nGRETA Okay. (walking on \nEGGSHELLS) Before I forget -- Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands. \nFLETCHER I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks. \nGRETA '\u00b7...dick with them.\" Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. . \nFLETCHER I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar.. \nGRETA (jotting down a \nseemed more important than attending my son's birthday! \nA U D R EY M y God!! She SLAMS DOWN the phone. \nINT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE \nFletcher BANGS THE PHONE against his head in frustration! '. \nFLETCHER \nA H H H H H H ! ! I WHAT IS WRONG WITH \nME I ! I \nE X T . FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN - MORNING \nThe Volvo parks. Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her son.             ,                 . \nMAX Is dad picking me up? \nAUDREY No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed. \nMAX I guess my wish didn't come \u00b7 true. \nAUDREY What wish? \nMAX I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved. \nINT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE \nHe's dialing the phone. \nFLETCHER Answer, answer, answer... \nINTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR \nAUDREY Hello. \nFLETCHER Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me-- \nAUDREY Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you. \nFLETCHER. What do you mean? \nAUDREY Max and I are moving to Boston. \nFLETCHER What?! \nAUDREY Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here. \nFLETCHER (panicking)    . Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him. \nAUDREY Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now. \nFLETCHER Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone? \nAUDREY That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye. \nFLETCHER Where are you? \nAUDREY Heading home. \nFLETCHER When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk. \nAUDREY \nFLETCHER-- \nFLETCHER I'll be right- there! \nHe hangs up and heads for the door.      It opens and Miranda enters. \nFLETCHER No. \nPOLICE OFFICER Do you think I'm an idiot? \nFLETCHER Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't! \nPOLICE OFFICER I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me? \nFLETCHER I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. (begrudgingly, off the officer's look) Unpaid parking tickets. \n(BESEECHINGLY) Be gentle. \nEXT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nA cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is headed to her car. \nFLETCHER Audrey, wait! \nAUDREY Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait. \nFLETCHER I can explain-- \nAUDREY I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab? \nFLETCHER Yes. \nAUDREY Where's your car? \nEXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING \nAudrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars. \nFLETCHER Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me. \nAUDREY I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents. \nFLETCHER Ow. \nAt this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) You scratched my car! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Where?     . \nFLETCHER Right there! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Oh that? That was already there. \nFLETCHER \n(OUTRAGED) Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this? \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE What? \nFLETCHER (angrier and \nANGRIER) ...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe! \nTOW-YARD EMPLOYEE You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes. \nAUDREY Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out. \nFLETCHER Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation. \n. AUDREY What do you want to say? \nFLETCHER You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair. \nAUDREY Let' s define \"fair.\" Last \u00b7 night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair? \nFLETCHER Last night-- \nFLETCHER It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me. \nCRAIG So what do you do? \nFLETCHER (growing more and more impatient) I help people fight over their money and their children. \nTHEODORE Can't they fight without you? \nFLETCHER ' \" They could but then J wouldn't make a living. \nJILL Why would my daddy leave my mommy? \nFLETCHER To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then: \nMS. BERRY \n(BRIGHTLY) Well, I think it's time for fingerpainting. \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY \nThey're in the playground just outside the classroom. \nFLETCHER Monster-Max. \nMAX Dadzilla. You came to play catch? \nFLETCHER No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen? \nMAX Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair... \nFLETCHER That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh. \n'       MAX . I want to play kickball with my friends.- \nFLETCHER Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed. \nMAX Really? You mean you have to tell the truth? \nFLETCHER Yes. \nMAX No matter what? \nFLETCHER No matter what. \nMax grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession. \nMAX Is wrestling real? \nFLETCHER In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no. \nMAX Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind? \nFLETCHER Not in a million years. \nMAX If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible \nFACE) will it get stuck that way? \nFLETCHER Uh-uh. \nMAX .If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown? \nFLETCHER Only if you can't 'swim. \nMAX Why do I have to eat squash? \nFLETCHER Because your mom buys it. \nMAX How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful. \nA worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by. \nMACHO ATTORNEY Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging? \nFLETCHER Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway. \nPHILIP Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card -- \nFLETCHER No -- \nPHILIP Or my phone was busy -- \nFLETCHER No -- \nPHILIP Or you just forgot -- \nFLETCHER No -- \nPHILIP (cannot be \nDISCOURAGED) Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely. \nFLETCHER Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then -- \nPHILIP Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on. \nINT. OFFICE'S - DAY \nFletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her. \nGRETA Do you want your messages? \nFLETCHER No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows him in, leaving his door open. \nINT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nFletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters. \nGRETA Are you okay? \nFLETCHER My son hates me. \nGRETA No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero. \nFLETCHER O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a \u00b7wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day. \nGRETA Kids... \nFLETCHER It came true. \nGRETA What? \nFLETCHER It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning? \nGRETA Well, yeah, but... \n(INCREDULOUS) You're telling me that you can't lie. \nFLETCHER That's right!     I am incapable of lying. \nINT. OUTER OFFICE \nMiranda is 'eavesdropping.    A wicked gleam in her eye, \nINT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE \nGRETA Just today? \nFLETCHER Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse. \nGRETA Yes, those are going around. \nFLETCHER Extremely. \nMIRANDA Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall. \nMIRANDA (CONT'D) Fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by Mr. Allan himself? (off his wary \nNOD) Say, you used to work directly for Mr. Allan, didn't you? (off his waried \nNOD) Tell me, what do you think of him? \nFLETCHER \n(HELPLESS) He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. \nMIRANDA \n(GRINNING) How delightful! She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into -- \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN, the founder himself. Fletcher freezes. \nMIRANDA Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid. \nMR. ALLAN \u00b7It's good to see you again, Fletcher. '. An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher. \nMIRANDA Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's trying to hold it back, but-- \nMIRANDA I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan? \nFLETCHER     . He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics. \nMR. ALLAN Marvelous! Marvelous! That's what I love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship! Miranda is incensed. \nMR. ALLAN (CONT'D) And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary. My wife loved them. \nFLETCHER Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nFletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   . \nINT. COURTROOM \nCLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole. \nBAILIFF All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits. \nJUDGE STEVENS Counselors, are we ready to begin? \nFLETCHER (eagerly and a little too \nLOUDLY) N o sir! We are not ready to b eg in. My client has not arrived. The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN and a NANNY. \nFLETCHER      \u00b7   . --   until now. \nHe collapses into his chair. \n(to Falk, with \nDETERMINATION) Did you and Mrs. Cole ever make lo-- forni-- roll in the h-- make the beast with two ba -- Did you two ever fu-- fu-- Fu! He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk. \nVIRGINIA Wate r! Get him water! Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on. \nFLETCHER Fu-- fu-- \nVIRGINIA S it down! Get some air! (slaps him on the \nBACK) Try to relax! Breathe deeply! Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING in PAIN. - \nVIRGINIA (CONT'D) W hat?!   What?! \nVIRGINIA (O.S.) Yes! YES! YES! The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still moment. . . As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no- nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile. \nDANA Your witness. \nFLETCHER No questions. \nJUDGE STEVENS No questions? . \nVIRGINIA No questions? \nFLETCHER (afraid to ask \nANY) No questions. \nDANA \n(TRIUMPHANT) Petitioner rests. \nJUDGE STEVENS All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed. \nFLETCHER (to himself) How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins. \nFLETCHER (CONT'D) Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break? \nJUDGE STEVENS It can't wait? \nFLETCHER Not unless you want to mop up. \nJUDGE STEVENS \n(FRUSTRATED) All right, but get back in here immediately so .we can finish this. Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out. \nINT. REST ROOM - DAY \nFletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch. It's only 4:15. ' \nFLETCHER What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door. \nMAN What's going on in-there? \nFLETCHER (O . S . ) I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED. \nBAILIFF I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him. \nJUDGE STEVENS Who did this? \nFLETCHER \n(TRUTHFULLY) A madman, Your Honor.. A desperate fool at the end of his pitiful.rope. \nJUDGE STEVENS -What did he look like? \nFLETCHER \n(DESCRIBING \nHIMSELF) About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in his eye. \nJUDGE STEVENS Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel. \nJUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine. Fletcher smiles serenly -- until -- \nJUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) -- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed? Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering, but he can't repress the truth. \nJUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) Can you? \nFLETCHER Yes, I can. \nFLETCHER C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question! \nFLETCHER Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes... \nFLETCHER Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole? \nFALK Yes. \nFLETCHER Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The \"not\" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise. \nFALK Excuse me? \nFLETCHER If I might rephrase your Honor. (trying again) Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not? \nX\\ Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? Is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? (thinks he's got it, beams with \nCONFIDENCE) Mr. Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? \nFALK \n(CONFUSED) No.     I mean, yes.     I think. \nFLETCHER Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? \nFALK What? \nFLETCHER How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking?              ' \nDANA Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness! \nJUDGE STEVENS It's hig witness! \nFLETCHER Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- (losing it) \nYOU HAD SEX WITH HER EVERYTIME \nYOU MET, DIDN'T YOU? DIDN'T \nYOU?!! Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on, unable to stop \nFLETCHER (screaming at \nHIM) \nADMIT IT! YOU .SLAMMED HER!! \nYOU STOKED THE FUR FIRE! YOU \n-DID THE YAM DANCE! ! \nFALK (breaking down) \nYES, YES,-- IT'S TRUE! I \nHUMPED HER. BRAINS OUT! ! A GASP from the audience. All eyes are on Fletcher. \nFLETCHER \n(WEAKLY) No further questions. \nDANA Uh...no questions. \nJUDGE STEVENS (to Fletcher) Call your next witness. \nFLETCHER I have no further witnesses, your Honor. A MURMUR erupts from the crowd. \nJUDGE STEVENS You have no further witnesses?! \nFletcher meekly shakes his head, no. \nVIRGINIA (whispers, to \n(off his look) One-twenty-six. I swear! \nFLETCHER So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? \nVIRGINIA \n(JOYFULLY) Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older. I was born in 1965!\" \nFLETCHER \n(FEIGNING \nSURPRISE) What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older? \nVIRGINIA Yes! \"  lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I \nGOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I- went-to-law-school'! \nJUDGE STEVENS Mr. Reid, does this have a point? \nFLETCHER Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! (on a roll) My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR \nCAN ENTER INTO A LEGAL \nCONTRACT WITHOUT PARENTAL \nCONSENT INCLUDING-- \nDANA (defeated, to \nHERSELF) Prenuptual agreements. \nFLETCHER (knows he has \nTHEM) \nPRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK YOU VERY LITTLE! This contract is void!!! The fact that my client gets nailed \u00b7 more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!! (to Dana) Yo . . . . a e . . . . T A T T T ! ! u         r           OSTT! \n(DRAMATICALLY) Nothing further, your Honor! \nA MURMUR OVERTAKES THE ROOM! \nJUDGE STEVENS (banging his \nGAVEL) Q uie t! Let me see-the license and birth certificate. All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents. Then: \nJUDGE STEVENS In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated.                    ' \nMR. ALLAN That son of bitch pulled it off! Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously, Miranda gives him the finger. \nJUDGE STEVENS O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct? \nFLETCHER AND DANA \nYES-- \nVIRGINIA No!   I'm contesting custody. \nFletcher freezes. \nFLETCHER What? \nVIRGINIA (re: her husband) Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million. \nFLETCHER He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? . \nVIRGINIA No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts. \nFLETCHER But -- but -- you said he was a good father. \nJUDGE STEVENS M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children. \nOUT) Yes, well, I heard you went all noble in front of Mr. Allan so-- \nFLETCHER Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here.., \nGRETA Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?! \nFLETCHER Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth. \n(checks his \nWATCH) Oh, my God!! I have to go! Thanks again, Greta! (as he runs off he calls back to \nHER) By the way, the truth is that I need you and I couldn't file a paperclip without you! Greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her \"composure\". \nCUT TO: \nEXT.STREETS/INT. BMW \nFletcher's driving like a madman... \nFLETCHER (on his phone) Answeransweransweranswer...

BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading \u00b7 right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE \nCART. . - And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING! \nAudrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A \nMOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE! \nCLOSE ON FLETCHER \nWith all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT \nFletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED. He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES. \nFLETCHER (mumbles to \nHIMSELF) Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes indeed. \nDEPUTY Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nFletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a shoe, and still holding the compress. \nFLETCHER \n(WEAKLY) Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY waiting for him just outside the door. Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY. He sees his dad, then quickly turns away. \nFLETCHER (to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper) Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. (no response) You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . . \nAUDREY Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing? \nFLETC HER That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin... \nFLETCHER Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty, \nSINCERELY) I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher said, but the way he said it. \nFLETCHER I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced. \nAUDREY You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight. \nFLETCHER I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry. \nFLETCHER I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again? \nJERRY I design security systems. \nFLETCHER How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec? \nJERRY The biggest. \nFLETCHER One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    .. \nAUDREY Don't put Jerry in the middle. \nJERRY It's okay. (to Fletcher) Boston means this (snaps his \nFINGERS) to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey. \nAUDREY All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset. \nAUDREY You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today. \nFLETCHER Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING, \n", "test1_input": "FLETCHER You know, you were much easier when we were married...

Max runs up to him. \nJERRY Max, my man! Jerry gives Max \"five\", then kisses Audrey on the lips. \nJERRY Fletcher, good to see you? \nFLETCHER What? No kiss for me? \nJERRY (re: luggage) What do you say, Max? Give me a hand?

Gate 17.\" Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!! \nINT. LAX ESCALATOR \nFletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says \nSTAND ON RIGHT. \nFLETCHER Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money... \nWOMAN Help the poor?... \nFLETCHER (speeding past) I don't trust you. I don't know what the hell that uniform is. Sorry. (a Hare Krishna tries to stop \nHIM) \nNOT NOW, TOGA BOY! \nINT. LAX - SECURITY AREA \nFortunately, there's no line at the metal detector. Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM. \nINSPECTOR Please step through again. \nFLETCHER Ahhh!! !    Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex into a tray.

Goes for it when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Can I help you? \nFLETCHER Look out!! ! -- \n(TRUTHFUL) \n-NOTHING'S COMING!! The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT! \nEXT. TARMAC - DAY \nHe scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane which is moving away. No way he'll catch it. Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT (These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets an insane idea. . . The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS. \nWORKER Hey!!      Hey!!!! But Fletcher's gone. \nEXT. AIRPLANE - DAY \nFletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the plane. GROUND WORKERS react. Soon, the \"stairs\" are racing alongside the plane. Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low to see in the plane. He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS \nTHE STEPS! \nThe \"stairs\" sway back and forth as he reaches the top. \nINT.

Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls. At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS. He surfs under the wing... ...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side. Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally spots. . . \nMAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him. Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER. Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO \nNOISY. Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE! \nFLETCHER'S POV The RUNWAY is ENDING!. \nJust then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now trying to help Jerry find his seat belt. \nAUDREY (checks under his \nSEAT) It's right here, honey. \nM AX Mom!   Mom!!

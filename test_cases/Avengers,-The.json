Emma ... \nAs a GROWLING sound grows till \nBOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma. \n34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION) \nThe blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating backwards in -- \nA milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control, weightless, powerless, as -- \nThe background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish.

Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair. \nLooks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow. \nSame every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel. From outside ANOTHER SHOT ... \nEmma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees -- \n37      HER POV \na CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The damn thing BACKFIRES again ... \nJust then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message, an upper-class woman's voice: \nWOMAN (V.O.) (filtered) Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John Steed ... \nBEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers. Puzzled, she holds up a fish. \nEMMA Kippers ...? \n48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY \nNear the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15. Out gets -- \n-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, \"Boodles Gentlemen's Club.\"  She goes in, passing -- \n-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire. \n49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nA PORTER approaches her, equally surprised. \nPORTER May I help you, madam ... \nEMMA Mr. John Steed, please. \nPORTER I'm afraid that's impossible. \nEMMA Impossible? \nThe Porter points to a notice:  \"No non-members.  No animals.  No women.\" \nPORTER You are female? \nEMMA As you see. \nPORTER Then you can't come in. \nEMMA I have an appointment. \nPORTER No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922. \nEMMA Really -- what happened in 1922? \nBored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave. \nThe Porter rushes up to restrain her. \nHardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. The Porter winces and -- \nEMMA Thank you so much. I can find Mr. Steed myself ... \n-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors, upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into \n50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY \nThru a cloud of steam in an oriental room \nSteed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees -- \nEmma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction. \nSTEED Doctor Peel, I presume? \nEMMA And you must be Steed. Please don't get up. \nHe doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study. \nSTEED I was about to throw in the towel. \nEMMA I had a spot of bother at the door. \nSTEED I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- \nEMMA 1922. Why the kippers? \nSTEED Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? \nEMMA (looks around) So what was all this -- some sort of test? \nSTEED Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. \nEMMA Whereas you are. \nSTEED Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules. \nEMMA Rules are made to be broken. \nSTEED Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. \nEMMA And just what is the game? \nSTEED I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? \nEMMA (re:  the steamroom) Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. \nSTEED Much better. \nEMMA And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you? \nSTEED I didn't. Mother did. \nEMMA Mother? \nSteed steps closer, smiling. \nFATHER (to Steed) Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. \nEMMA I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? \nMOTHER Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. \nSTEED Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel -- \nEmma hesitates, unsure for the first time ... \nEMMA I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work. I've been out of action for some time. I'll consider your proposal. \nShe gets up, ready to go. \nFATHER One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another special reason we wanted you to join our happy family; rather curious, actually ... \nMother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification, identikit sketches. \nMOTHER Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area. One description tallied in all three places. Recognize her? \nEmma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts. \nEMMA Me, isn't it? \nEmma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister. \nFATHER Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect. \nEMMA You're saying I have no choice. \nMOTHER Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. \nEMMA (very arch) Ropes? \n55      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY \nA life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and -- \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  Is riddled with holes by \nEmma, who works at reloading as \n56      HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY \nlooking on, Mother with Steed. \nSTEED Think she really killed those agents? \nMOTHER She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. \nSTEED Amnesia? \nMOTHER Possibly. Split personality ... \nSTEED Insane ... ? \nMOTHER Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. \nSTEED Why? \nMOTHER She may try to kill you. \n57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY \nEmma swiftly turns, aims, and -- \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp. \nSTEED Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. Darling. \n58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM \nA gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie (1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show. \nAs DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard, Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air. \nDR. DARLING One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow: she's obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. You may find her a little ... remote. \nImages of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him. \nDR. DARLING They were a team. Met at Cambridge. Working on a top secret research mission into weather conditions, code name The Prospero Project, when Peel died. \nSteed looks meaningfully at Mother. \nMOTHER Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. \nSTEED How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling? \nDR. DARLING Her husband was one of ours. \nSTEED (eyes Peel's photo, then Mother) Peel? Did she know? \nMOTHER Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination. \nSTEED Anyone particular in mind? \nMOTHER You. \nOFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ... \n59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON \nSteed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech dueling ... \nEMMA But why? What's the point? \nSTEED A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. \nEMMA And I suppose you're the knight. \nSTEED The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. \nEMMA That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know. \nSteed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing? \nSTEED I'm hoping you will. \nHe puts his foot down.  Zoom ... \n68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nTowards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ... \n69      INT.  JAG - DAY \nEmma consults a list, reads -- \nEMMA Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? \nSTEED As per mother's instructions. \nEMMA Do we always follow Mother's instructions? \nSTEED For a man in my position -- \nEMMA Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? \nSTEED (smiles) They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. \nEMMA I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? \nSTEED After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? \nEMMA No thanks. \nSTEED I meant me. \nEmma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours. \n70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY \nThe Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car. \nSTEED (V.O.) According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... \nEMMA (V.O.) An eccentric recluse? \n71      INT.  JAG - DAY \nSTEED Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. \nEMMA June, July ... August? \nSTEED The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. \nEMMA Any other vices? \nSTEED All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. (off her look) British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens. \nEmma takes this in. \nEMMA So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How? \nSTEED Small talk.  Try the weather. \n72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY \nSteed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates \nSigns:  \"Private: No Admittance.\"  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded rifles.  They start up the drive ... \nSeveral peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails. \nOne of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a CAMERA ... \nThe other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them. \n73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY \nOn a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal: \nA BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor -- \n-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor. \nEMMA Original ... \nBUTLER This way, miss ... \nEMMA Missus ... \nHe opens the double doors, admitting Emma into \n74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM \nof semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads: \nSTEED Manners, Mrs. Peel. \nEmma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- \nBLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS -- \n80      EMMA'S POV \n-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes close ... \n81      EMMA \nmoves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good bye kiss. \n82      STEED'S POV\t82 \nThe sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSound of CLACKING ... \nFADE IN: \n83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY \nA hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to \nSteed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very nonchalant.  Eating his grapes. \nSTEED Ah, Brenda ... (as she leaves) Mrs. Peel? \nEMMA You should be dead.  How do you feel? \nSTEED (eyes her) Strange. \nEMMA You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. \nSTEED I wasn't about to. \nEMMA I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed. \nSTEED I might say the same. \n84      FROM GALLERY \nMother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. But they both are wearing headphones. \nEMMA Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. \nSTEED Why should they think that? \nEMMA You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. \nSTEED Frankly that's how I remember it. \nEMMA But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. \nSTEED Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. \nEMMA (conceding) That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. \nSTEED Did he say who? \nEMMA No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this. \nEmma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. \"The Wonderland Corporation,\" followed by -- \nSTEED An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? \nEMMA Did you say formal? I must dress. \n85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT \nThe sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door. Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit -- \n86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL \nhitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring -- \nSTEED I must say, you look more your old self -- \nEMMA You mean my other self ... \nSTEED Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? \nEMMA I should have thought that was obvious ... (off his smirk) I'm in mourning. \nShe moves off.  Stay on his poker face. \nSTEED I can't wait to see afternoon. \nHe joins her; they survey the building. \nEMMA Where's the picnic? \nThey look up to -- \n87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nA boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling -- \nAround a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ... \nSTEED For you, Mrs. Peel. \nEMMA Thanks ... (dry) I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello? \nIt's Sir August. \nSIR AUGUST (V.O.) (filtered) Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! \nCLICK. \nEMMA Sir August...? (to Steed) What now? \nSTEED Ask Mother. \nSound OVER:  RING-RING. \n122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY \nSir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS. Finally, Sir August answers. \nSIR AUGUST Mrs. Peel -- ? \nVOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Ask not for whom the telephone rings ... \nSIR AUGUST No, please! I beg you ... \nVOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Walk over to the window ... \nSIR AUGUST Let it be rain, please let it be -- \nVOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Stay by the window. By the window. \nMesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late. \n123     OUTSIDE \na purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a LIGHTNING STRIKE. And -- \nBOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes in ... \nFATHER (V.O.) Emergency alert ... \n124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY \nPAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down deserted streets. \nFATHER (V.O.) A cyclone hit Banffshire last night. Completely unpredicted ... \n125     INSIDE CAR \nEMMA Where's Mother? \nFATHER Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ... \nFather drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease. \nFATHER You're probably wondering how I can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new prototype from the boys in X division. Micro-sensors in the system read signals and road information. Converts the info into miles per hour. Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart. \nFather jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. Steed holds onto his hat. \nSTEED We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. \nFATHER So you say ... \nEMMA You don't believe him? \nFATHER It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here. \nFather SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue \nSteed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ... \nEMMA But \nSTEED Don't bother.  Here's a bus ... \nA red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the bodyguard, Brenda. \nBRENDA Fares, please, \n126     INT.  BUS - DAY \nSteed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the conductor.  Go upstairs. \n127     UPSTAIRS \nis Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out. \nMOTHER Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried. \nEMMA He tried to warn us ... \nSTEED We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... \nMOTHER Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. \nSTEED Impossible. \nEMMA Not quite. This is my field. \nSTEED Is there anything that isn't? \nEMMA (ignores) The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... \nSteed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt. \nEMMA Is that what you think? \nSTEED Oh, well ... (beat) Just my type, Mrs. Peel. \n134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY \nThe Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing, which just misses them -- \n135     INT. LOTUS - DAY \nEmma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks -- \nSTEED Do you always drive this fast? \nEMMA Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? (before his reply) We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... \nSteed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up. Emma glances in the mirror, and -- \nEMMA Hold on ... \nPuts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind. \n136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY \nThe Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ... \n137     BEND \nbefore Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner -- \nAnd suddenly sees in front of her -- \n138     HUGE TRUCK \ncrossing directly in their path! \nSTEED Turn! \n139     EMMA \nswerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as -- \n140     TRUCK \nclears in time for the following car, which keeps going. \n141     ON HAYSTACK \nas Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ... \nOLD LADY Are you alright, young man? \nSTEED I think so, thank you so much ... \nA SQUEAL of TIRES as - \nThe following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the Old Lady react ... \nBAILEY (relishing) Reach for the sky, pardner. \nSteed raises his hands. \nOLD LADY Oh, dear -- \nTo Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and \nBANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed. \nOLD LADY Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy. \nSTEED I feel sure of it. \nOLD LADY I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you? \nSTEED (looks around) She was ... \nThey start pulling away hay from the haystack ... \nOLD LADY You with Mother or Father? \nSTEED Both, actually. \nOLD LADY Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry. \nSTEED (not paying attention) You don't say. (mumbles) Like looking for a needle in a ... \n142     INSIDE HAYSTACK \nCoughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal his relief at seeing her. \nSTEED What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? \nEMMA Barely. \nSTEED You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? \nHe pulls her out.  She's annoyed. \n143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK \nEmma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw. \n155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS \nRooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors. \n156     INSIDE ROOMS \nA mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists' dummies... and ... \nButterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ... \nThen Emma turns into a whole room of ... \nSnow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. Emma picks up one snow scene. \nShe shakes it. \n157     EXT.  HOUSE \nas if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in. \n158     IN MAZE \nA drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open. \nSTEED (re: rain) Not again. \nHe rises, looks down, reacts -- \nAlice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to her in the rain \nOLD LADY It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware. Tell Father. \nShe dies in his arms. \nWind picks up, too. \nSteed looks about, frowning with discouragement -- \n159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY \nTHUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker. \n160     FROM BEHIND \nEmma hears the unmistakable chilling voice: \nVOICE (V.O.) I wouldn't shake that too hard. The weather might turn nasty. \nFrom the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker. \nEMMA Quite a collection. \nVOICE (V.O.) If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass. \nOutside the big window the weather is turning nasty ... \nEMMA Your voice -- it's so familiar ... \nVOICE (V.O.) We have met ... \nFrom the shadows, a man moves out, revealing: \nPeter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER. \nEMMA Peter ... ? \nInstinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause. \nEMMA I must be dreaming ... \nEmma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ... \nPETER Listen... Very much alive. \nPeter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. Peter raises her hand to his lips. \nPETER Darling, it's me... \nEmma shudders, battles with herself. \nEMMA Peter ... \nEmma is tempted, yet filled with terror. \n161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES \nInside her pupil -- \nFLASH CUTS TO: \n162     MEMORY FLASHES \nHis face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass obscuring his face. \n163     BACK TO SCENE \nEMMA Impossible ... how? \nPeter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious. \nPETER For you ... all for you ... \nPeter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until -- \nDR.  DARLING White ... \nEMMA Knight ... \nDR. DARLING Black... \nEMMA ... death ... \nDR. DARLING Love... \nEMMA ... death ... \nSteed watching, listening ... \nDR. DARLING Flower ... \nEMMA ... power ... \nThe exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her straps. \nDR. DARLING Nature ... \nEMMA ... preserve... \nDR. DARLING Secret ... \nEMMA ... love... \nDR. DARLING Hope... \nEMMA ... love ... \nDR. DARLING Fear ... \nEMMA ... love ... \nDR. DARLING Peter ... \nAs Emma talks, the \"Dreamscape\" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past. \nEMMA ... Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers how many pecks of pickled peppers did Peter Peel -- ? \n174     CLOSEUP - EMMA \nQuietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble. \nEMMA How long have I been here? \nDR. DARLING Three days. \nEmma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy. \nEMMA Do you get paid by the hour? \nDr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The \"Dreamscape\" machine winds down.  Up in the gallery -- \nBAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings \nMOTHER (filtered) You are here under observation, Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. Darling's questions \nPushes Dr. Darling aside. \nEMMA I resign. \nMOTHER (filtered) You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. \nEMMA Watch me. \nEmma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the hypnodisc. \nEmma heads for the airlock door marked: \n\"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE\" \nMOTHER Don't open that, Mrs. Peel! \nFat chance ... she goes in ... \n175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER \nEmma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair, Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the \"OFF\" switch \nEMMA (echoing) What are you trying to do to me? \nMOTHER (flailing) We want to help...! \nEMMA I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. \nMOTHER The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... \nEMMA To you ... ? \nMother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the \"OFF\" switch. They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair, Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother -- \nSTEED I think you owe Mrs. Peel an explanation ... \nSteed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations. \nMOTHER Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved. \nEMMA The Institute ... the funding ... \nMOTHER A cover ... for us. (beat) I'm sorry... \nEmma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ... \n185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY \nA medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma as Steed watches her lay -- \nA red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of eternal sleep:  Peter Peel. \nEmma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed. \nEMMA You followed me. \nSTEED Orders. \nEMMA To kill me? \nSTEED (fractional pause) Nothing personal. \nEmma smiles. Then turns, and -- \nRuns!  Steed follows Emma through a door to -- \n186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY \nSteed enters, glimpses -- \nEmma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral staircase.  Steed listens, follows. \n187     UP BELLTOWER \nFrom below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches -- \n188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY \nBELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. Looks.  A long way down. From behind -- \nEMMA A long way down. \nSteed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from the edge, Emma circles him. \nSTEED Careful. You might fall. \nEmma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. Rocking to and fro ... \nEMMA I could save you the trouble. \nSTEED No trouble. \nEMMA Because you always obey orders ... \nSTEED Always. (pause) Except ... \nSteed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge. \nEMMA Yes ... ? \nSTEED ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust. \nSteed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand. \nEMMA And do you trust me? \nSTEED I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... \nEMMA It wasn't me; you have my word. \nSteed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms. \nSTEED I need proof. \nEmma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek. \nSTEED It was longer. On the lips. \nEmma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her hand, pulls her back. \nSTEED Much longer.  Approximately ... fifteen seconds. \nEmma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him. \nEMMA ... Ready? \nSteed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her watch.  Counts seconds ... \nEMMA ... Four ... seven ... ni-... \nThen ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay embracing for fifteen seconds ... \nEMMA (aroused) Mmm ... what are you doing? \nSTEED Keeping a stiff upper lip? \nEMMA Is that all? \nThe kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort, she regains her composure.  A long silence. \nEMMA So I'm in the clear? \nSteed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all. \nEMMA But you did suspect me. \nSTEED Not for a moment. \n196     DOWN LONG HALL \nBad \"Emma\" walks over.  She stands in front of him. \nBlank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize on her neck a tattoo:  Z424. \nDR. DARLING We are in the final phase. I shall require you to be especially obedient. There must be no failures. \n197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER \nwhich he grips tightly. As -- \n198     IN MIRROR \na metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ... \nShakes the snowshaker ... \n199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nTHUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal: \nSteed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts. \n200     INT.  JAG - DAY \nSteed driving, winces with the drizzle. \nSTEED Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? \nEMMA No idea who. No idea why ... \nSTEED (thinks) Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... \nEMMA ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. \nSTEED Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? \nEMMA Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody. \nSteed thinks; sighs. \nSTEED Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. \nEMMA I'm a wanted woman, I know ... \n201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY \nThrough a door marked \"Information & Counter Espionage\" -- \n-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella and bowler.  Which is \nEmma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by. \nSTEED His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. \nEMMA Why's he called 'Invisible'? \nSTEED You'll find out. \nAt a door marked \"Information -- Col. I. Jones.\" Steed knocks, opens the door for her. \nEMMA Aren't you coming? \nSTEED I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you. \nEmma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor. \n202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY \nA room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets full of old paper. \nDusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma hears -- \nFOOTSTEPS. \nShe follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her -- \nA filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own. \nEmma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a -- \nDesk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the phone lifts up by itself, a voice: \nINVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls. (beat) Colonel Jones at your service, Mrs. Peel. Just a moment -- \nEmma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As -- \nA desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe lights; smoke belches forth. \nINVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal. \nEMMA I see. \nINVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel? \n203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE \nSteed on the phone. \nSTEED I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ... Barometer's falling fast. Mrs. Peel and I find ourselves in need of foul weather gear. (beat) Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff for starters. And then -- \n204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE \nMINISTER (V.O.) ... In the uncertain climate that threatens this global initiative, no magic umbrella can shield us. \nSteed checks out his own. \nMINISTER (V.O.) Only our own vigilance. Security and stability are our watchwords. \nAPPLAUSE. \nSteed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside... \nEMMA Trubshaw again? What now? \nSTEED Snuff. (off Emma's lock) I must insist you try some. \nSteed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They walk on, open doors to -- \n209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAn empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a -- \n210     MARBLE HALLWAY \nA black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise, empty.  A chamber ensemble plays \"The Merry Widow\" waltz, which floats through empty halls. \nSTEED They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. \nEMMA (annoyed) 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? \nThey move cautiously forward as \n211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT \nOutside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. A Christmassy glow -- \nEven troops play with snowflakes, until -- \n212     SEVERAL ANGLES \nThe wind rises.  The snow falls harder. \n213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT \nDown in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As -- \nButlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. Steed steals -- \nA chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed looks up to see -- Father \"staring\" at him. \nSTEED Oh, hello ... \nFATHER We want Mrs. Peel. \nSTEED Dead, I'm afraid. \nEmma in hiding, listens as -- \nFATHER (O.S.) You disobeyed an order, Steed. Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot be trusted. \nEmma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to -- \nSTEED (O.S.) I think she can. (beat) Can you? \nEmma is deeply affected by Steed's choice. \nFather's face, meantime, has turned to stone. \nFATHER I shall summon security. \nShe turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away. \nEmma returns as the ALARM is raised -- \nSTEED Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? \nEMMA Have a look at this. \nShe leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow. Steed reacts, eyes wide. \nSTEED It's almost May, for heaven sake. \n214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT \nThe blizzard rages through streets -- \nNow impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up shop fronts.  And amid the sky -- \nFilled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting troops -- \n215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT \nSteed returns, rushes across the marble halls -- \nTo Emma. But up ahead, sees -- \n216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS \nA purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as -- \n217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT \nInside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls, ceiling murals -- \nThe World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by -- \n230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION \nSlam shut.  COOL HUM ... \n231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSteed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to get upstairs to help Emma... \n232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nUp Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No secret panels.  The \"floor\" light flickers between floors. \nWaiting, until ... \n233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma dives to the other side, then -- \nScrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It slips out ... \nJust beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the grenade towards the butlers, and -- \nAs her elevator doors close -- \nBOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom -- \nRushes to -- \n234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nWhere he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS. Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when -- \n235     BUTLER'S POV \nNo Emma. \n236     BACK TO SCENE \nThe butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and -- \nThe doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in -- \n237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION \n-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we -- \nPULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator roof, limbs flexed against the walls is -- \nEmma, who -- drops down and -- \nScissors the butler's head between her legs. \nThe grenade rolls free ... \nEmma twists around, grabs his ears, and -- \nSits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until -- \nEmma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags -- \n238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nHis head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for the stairs, the elevators doors. \nSLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which \n239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nBreaks from its ropes, and -- \nPlummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes -- \n240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nEverything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles... \n241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT \nUp the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which -- \nFlips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the skylight.  As the grenade -- \n242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE \nBOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked. \nA moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips the skylight up, and -- \nEmerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her. \n243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT \nBlades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined whirly chopper ... \nAnother assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up before her -- \nEmma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls. Flicks him backwards ... \nAs his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward. But too late:  sees -- \nThe chopper -- about to take off. \n244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER \nZig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows. \n258     SEVERAL ANGLES \nas Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ... \n259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT \nThe chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ... \nUp ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and lights in the sky thru snowflakes ... \nEmma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and -- \n260     CLOSEUP SHOT \nDetaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit. \n261     HER POV \nThe bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge! \n262     INT.

Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in appreciation ... great fireworks! \n264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT \nEmma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him. \nHe runs too -- towards -- \n265     ANOTHER CHOPPER \nwhich unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... The Man reaches for the dangling ladder -- but -- \n266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT \nstuck, wedged between narrow battlements. \n267     BACK TO SCENE \nThe Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper, leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over, when she sees -- \n268     CLOSEUP - SHOE \nEmma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  \"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street.\" \nSTEED (V.O.) I thought it was Cinderella who lost her slipper ... \n269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN \nOn Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. Steed & Trubshaw beside her. \nEMMA This time the shoe's on the other foot. You said a hand-made shoe was as good as a photo-fit or D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is find the shoe that fits ... \nTRUBSHAW It should be easy. A Trubshaw client has his shoes delivered personally. The Ministry should be able to confirm our delivery. \nSTEED I'll be back ... \nEMMA Where are you going? \nSTEED Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... \nEMMA You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect. \nSTEED No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. \nEMMA But -- \nSTEED (comes back) Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. \nEMMA If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't -- \nSteed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder. \nSTEED A microtag. One of Mother's little toys. There you are. Free at last. \nHe tips his bowler off her surprised reaction. \n270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nAn armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords -- ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ... \nSteed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ... \n271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER \nEmma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe lasts. \nEMMA Prince Charming, I presume. Your name is ... \n272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL \nwith the name:  DARLING. \nHe pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile. \nVALENTINE My latest model. A compound of plastics and sensor chips. A big improvement on the old X404s. The poor thing is quite fond of me. Emma, say hello to Emma. \nBAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK. \nVALENTINE You know, I believe she's actually jealous. \nEMMA Valentine, listen to me ... \nVALENTINE Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. \nEMMA (covers her hand) Ring? \nHe stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then: \nVALENTINE How silly of me -- let me make you comfortable first ... \nAs he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye \nDISSOLVE TO: \n303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT \nAnother ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic layer to reveal -- \nSteed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and, poking with his umbrella -- \nDeflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the -- \n304     RED PHONEBOX \nSteed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits \"Button B.\"  As the floor lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ... \n305     SARCOPHAGUS \ncarved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into -- \n306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nas Valentine descends spiral steps to join it. \nValentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within. \nVALENTINE That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... \nEMMA You're mad. \nVALENTINE Entirely. On the other hand (he advances towards her, smiling) Mad people get things done. Let me show you -- \n307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nSteed stealing down a corridor and -- \nhides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and -- \nNabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down. \nFATHER Steed \nSTEED How did you guess? \nFATHER You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... \nSTEED It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. \nFATHER Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...' \nSTEED Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ... \nHolding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around. Sees -- \nA grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns and -- \n308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION \ncrawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing -- until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S. \nSteed reaches another grille, through which he can see -- \n309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER \nEmma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as Valentine explains. \nVALENTINE People expect weather to be free. They're used to it. I call that a denial of freedom. No freedom of choice. An abuse of human rights. They buy water, electricity, gas. Why shouldn't they be able to buy their own weather if they want to? If they have a little incentive ... \nEmma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her. \nEMMA Such as? \nVALENTINE Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air. \nEMMA The result would be ... \nVALENTINE Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples... \nEMMA Then what's stopping you? \nVALENTINE One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring. \nValentine takes her by the hand. Kisses -- \n310     CLOSEUP - HER RING \nStepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as -- \n318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE \nplaces a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ... \nWIDEN to reveal ... \n319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nMasses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... ) \nValentine hits a switch ... \nVALENTINE Start the countdown. Action stations. Five minutes ... \nThe countdown starts, red digitals going backwards -- \nColorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts. A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS. \nFather enters behind him. \nFATHER Congratulations. The clouds are on course ... \nVALENTINE To explode. London will be ashes. \nFATHER Not yet! They haven't heard our terms ... ! \nFather tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off. \nVALENTINE Are you insane? Stop the program and you activate the auto-destruct! \nFATHER But all those people -- ! \nValentine strikes her hard -- \nVALENTINE My cloud ballet! My cyclone! \nFather slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red lights, as -- \n320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT \nUp in the sky, more white clouds -- \nDarken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy Swirling with motion, a life of their own. \nFROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as it rolls -- \n321     THROUGH CITY STREETS \nthen RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.

Hugging Valentine. \nSTEED I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? \nVALENTINE Ugh ... \nAs the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as -- \nOne last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine locked in her arms in a dying embrace. \nThey fall into the mists and liquid below. \nSteed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.

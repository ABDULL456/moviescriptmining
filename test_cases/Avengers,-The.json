Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker. \n160     FROM BEHIND \nEmma hears the unmistakable chilling voice: \nVOICE (V.O.) I wouldn't shake that too hard. The weather might turn nasty. \nFrom the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker. \nEMMA Quite a collection. \nVOICE (V.O.) If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass. \nOutside the big window the weather is turning nasty ... \nEMMA Your voice -- it's so familiar ... \nVOICE (V.O.) We have met ... \nFrom the shadows, a man moves out, revealing: \nPeter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER. \nEMMA Peter ... ? \nInstinctively Emma moves towards him.

Very much alive. \nPeter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. Peter raises her hand to his lips. \nPETER Darling, it's me... \nEmma shudders, battles with herself. \nEMMA Peter ... \nEmma is tempted, yet filled with terror. \n161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES \nInside her pupil -- \nFLASH CUTS TO: \n162     MEMORY FLASHES \nHis face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass obscuring his face. \n163     BACK TO SCENE \nEMMA Impossible ... how? \nPeter smiles disarmingly.

I need it. \nPeter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading with her.

An extreme personality disorder. She imagines her husband Peter Peel has come back to her ... \nCLOSE ON Emma's face. \nDR. DARLING (V.O.)

We'll soon see what her unconscious looks like... \nEmma's eyes flicker... \nSteed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ... \nEmma looks around ...

Drowsy, disoriented. \nEMMA Where am I? \nSTEED The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me.

Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma as Steed watches her lay -- \nA red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of eternal sleep:  Peter Peel. \nEmma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.

You might fall. \nEmma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. Rocking to and fro ... \nEMMA I could save you the trouble. \nSTEED No trouble. \nEMMA Because you always obey orders ... \nSTEED Always. (pause) Except ... \nSteed nears her.

That kiss ... \nEMMA It wasn't me; you have my word. \nSteed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms. \nSTEED I need proof. \nEmma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then pecks him on the cheek. \nSTEED It was longer. On the lips. \nEmma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her hand, pulls her back. \nSTEED Much longer.  Approximately ... fifteen seconds. \nEmma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him. \nEMMA ... Ready? \nSteed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her watch.  Counts seconds ... \nEMMA ... Four ... seven ... ni-... \nThen ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.

Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort, she regains her composure.  A long silence. \nEMMA So I'm in the clear? \nSteed savors the kiss.  No reply.

Which ... \nRING-RING ... Starts to RING. \nEMMA Who could that be? \nA ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone. \nSTEED No -- don't answer it ... \nHe pulls her back.  Emma looks at him. \nSTEED That's it. The phones trigger the explosions -- \nRING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ... \nRING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.

Then walks calmly over to Steed, who's still prone. \nCHOIRBOY It's your mother. \nThe vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as -- \nSteed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box, takes the call. \nSTEED Mother? How did you find me? \nHis expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.

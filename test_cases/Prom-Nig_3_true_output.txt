88 CONTINUED: 88 Hammond's axe slashes into the rotten wood, sending splinters flying in all directions. Kim watches him work. He appears angry and upset. 
KIM Hi. Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump. Kim moves around to face him. When he sees her, Hammond jumps, startled. 
HAMMOND I didn't hear you. 
KIM 
(SMILES) Sorry. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Hammond struggles to catch his breath. 
HAMMOND I'm getting too old for this. 
KIM Why are you doing it now? 
HAMMOND Your mother's been hounding me to get it done... You got nay message? 
KIM 
(PUZZLED) No. 
HAMMOND 
(ANGRILY) I told that woman to tell you I had a meeting and couldn't drive you home. 
KIM Your secretary? 
HAMMOND 
(NODS) Idiot! 
KIM I liked her. Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump. 
(CONTINUED) 
88 CONTINUED: 2) 88 
KIM 
(CONTINUING) You okay? 
HA` ONND 
(SHRUGS) This thing with your mother... Have you seen her yet? 
KIM No. How is she? 
HAMMOND 
(SIGHS) One minute she's depressed, the next she's bubbling over like a child... She wants to go with me tonight. 
KIM Great! 
HAMMOND I'm not so sure. 
KIM I think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her.

{"test1_input": "TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall, with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER GORDON is reading from a prepared statement. \nGORDON After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000 in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force -- working in concert with Batman. \nAt the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the crowd: \nVOICES IN CROWD TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE -- \nGORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we saw in the park. \nGORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard over the din. \nGORDON I would like to stress -- that while this city enjoys a special relationship with Batman -- (louder) -- we do not condone vigilantism -- (practically screaming) -- IN ANY FORM. \nIt's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN \nThe evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a RED BERET as \"MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE BAT.\" \nSEKOWSKY And hey!  Where does this -- (BLEEP; expletive deleted) -- Gordon get off calling us ? We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all -- just like Batman. \nWOMAN IN CROWD You people are nothing but hoodlums! \nSEKOWSKY Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol riskin' our necks to protect old biddies like you. (into mike) If this lame-o Gordon could do his job -- \nMORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV screen, placing us in: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nwhere ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN. \nALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault. Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered the mike... \nSEKOWSKY (on TV) We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is alive in this city.  We're gonna take back the streets! \nSEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to chant: \"TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!\" Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and flicks it off. \nHe turns on the radio in search of something more soothing. \"Good King Wenceslas\" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a Sterling silver tea service. \nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a side drawer. \nThe drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads \"THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery. Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.\"  ALFRED digs around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at the rear of the drawer. \nGears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE STAIRWAY which descends into darkness... \nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nDescending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave. \"Good King Wenceslas\" is on the speakers down here as well. Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau, wrapped in a tarp. \nALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of BRUCE. \nALFRED Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE?? \nAs if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. \nBRUCE I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you. \nHe's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater -- but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel, buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly regains his composure: \nALFRED I took the liberty of preparing tea. (indicating tbe monitors) I take it you've been watching the news? \nBRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview and nods. \nBRUCE Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world. \nBRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS, connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING. \nALFRED I should inform you...Christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund. (eyeing the equipment) If I may inquire...? \nBRUCE Oh, yeah.  Watch this. \nBRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect -- stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably like the skeleton of an umbrella. \nALFRED Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly  it? \nBRUCE What does it look like? \nALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. \nSounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. \nBRUCE Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right. \nBRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. \nALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... \nBRUCE We can do better than that. \nALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... \n", "test1_true": "ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir? \nBRUCE Yeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki. \nALFRED (anxiously) Miss Vale, sir...? \nBRUCE Yeah.  I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas. \nBRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED heaves an audible sigh of relief as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nTIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare concrete wall.  Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons, cardinals, titwillows... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY ODD FIGURE in prison greys.  A CANARY, perched on his shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy, cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS with quick, birdlike strokes. \nMR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is \"obscene.\"  Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports himself with overblown, theatrical dignity.  Fastidious and preening, he does not suffer insults lightly. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars -- and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.  A PRISON GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door... \nGUARD Up and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy? \nMR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname. \nGUARD (cont.) Boniface... \nMR. BONIFACE finally turns.  With an expression of extreme distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out. \nINT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD. \nPAROLE OFFICER You want to return the money you stole. \nBONIFACE Intact.  The map will show you where it's buried. \nThe PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP. \nPAROLE OFFICER All of it.  Forty-two million dollars. \nMR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear. \nPAROLE OFFICER II Why this sudden change of heart? \nMR. BONIFACE Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full.  I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me.  The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people. \nPAROLE OFFICER II Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars?? \nMR. BONIFACE nods plaintively.  It's quite a perfomlance.  He dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and he's the delicate type... \nWARDEN His record's clean.  Thirteen years without an incident. \nATTORNEY I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use.  A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals... \nThe PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg. \nMR. BONIFACE Birds, yes.  My only source of solace. \nPAROLE OFFICER In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole. \nBONIFACE Thank you, sir.  You won't regret it. \nMR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE BOARD.  As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office: \nMYNAH CRIME DOES NOT PAY.  AAWWK!!  CRIME DOES NOT PAY. \nCHUCKLES all around.  On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board: \nATTORNEY Personally trained by my client. \nINT. PRISON CELL - DAY \nFree time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area.  T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.  BONIFACE whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH RAGE: \nMR. BONIFACE -- Where are my birds?!? \nT-BONE Shit, Pengy.  I let 'em go. \nMR. BONIFACE Hermione.  My canary.  It's the dead of winter! \nT-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR. BONIFACE's profound distress. \nT-BONE They were all cooped up.  With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do. \nBONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell.  He spots a scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD.  With a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile... \nMR. BONIFACE I see.  -- You might as well have this.  I won't be needing it... \nHe tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on.  The dim strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the earphones... \nT-BONE Well, thanks, Pengy.  No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours. \n", "test1_id": 1677, "test2_input": "He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: \nIF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD \nHe opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY \nBRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.  A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: \nBATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy \nHe hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.  He gets up... \nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY \nBRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. \nSELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! \nALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.  He's about to break into a sweat.  He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- \nSELINA (cont.) Bruce! \nBRUCE Selina.  What are you doing here? \nALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.  She's on him like a barnacle. \nSELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable.  How long have you had him? \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.  He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. \nBRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. \nSELINA It's incredibly awful.  It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. \nBRUCE Same here. \nSELINA It's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused.  Don't you think? \nBRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.  Everything gets her sort of aroused. \nINT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER \nSELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons.  She's like a kid in a toy shop. \nSELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? \nBRUCE Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste. \nSELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind.  I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay?  Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. \nPAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY \nINT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER \nALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout.  He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. \nALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. \nBRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... \nALFRED What exactly are you -- \nBRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. \nALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- \nBRUCE Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? \nALFRED Raven, sir? \nBRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost.  A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. \nHe continues to scan the screen.  ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. \nALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- \nBRUCE What, Alfred? \nALFRED Your father had a raven, sir.  A small statue of the very sort you describe.  It used to sit on his desk. \nThis piques BRUCE's interest.  He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. \nBRUCE What happened to it? \nALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. \nBRUCE Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree? \nALFRED George Tiptree.  Your friend Elliott's father. \n", "test2_true": "INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON \nTIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed.  It's empty -- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's stuffing inside it.  His head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell... \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nTIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the ENTRYWAY below.  Standing there is an unexpected visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a battery of COPS pat him down. \nBRUCE What are you looking for -- Batarangs? \nTIPTREE Bruce!  Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone. \nThe COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs. \nINT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER \nTIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him. BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX. \nBRUCE I brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it. \nTIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE CLASP.  He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude.  BRUCE nods for him to try it on, and he obliges... \nTIPTREE ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. \nBRUCE I think you may have something that belonged to my father. \nTIPTREE -- You know? \nHe stares at BRUCE, astonished.  His head sinks into his hands. \nTIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow.  One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce.  I'm gonna give him the last two ravens.  He's already got the others. \nBRUCE What are you talking about?  Who? \nTIPTREE Batman.  I don't know how he found out, but -- \nTIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands. \nBRUCE It's time you told me what's going on here. \nTIPTREE Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce?  All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune. \nBRUCE Whose fortune? \nTIPTREE Gotham City's. \nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) \nThe cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham.  A massive EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming, POLICE rushing to the scene... \nTIPTREE In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted.  It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision.  The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion... \nA HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner.  Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a GATLING GUN into the crowd.  POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction. \nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) \nCITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth, arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS -- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE. \nTIPTREE (V.O.) The city was going under.  Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out.  In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts -- \nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE \nBRUCE The Five Families. \nTIPTREE Our ancestors.  They bought Gotham City -- carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps.  And in all this time no one's ever suspected -- \nBRUCE -- that they were the ones behind the robbery? \nFLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS) \nThe FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne Manor, raising a celebratory toast.  CAMERA PANS OVER to a nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES. \nTIPTREE (O.S.) They had five ravens made.  Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it.  They never needed to.  It's still there to this day. \nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE \nTIPTREE The ravens, and the secret -- have been passed down through generations.  Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you. \nBRUCE So they stole his piece of the puzzle. \nTIPTREE Yeah.  I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over.  He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... \nBRUCE stares at him, stony-faced.  There's one part of the story that doesn't quite add up. \nBRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott.  My father was a decent man -- an honorable man.  He would never have taken part in a scheme like this. \nTIPTREE It wasn't his doing, Bruce.  It was -- \nBRUCE That doesn't matter.  If he knew that his fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to -- \nTIPTREE Christ, Bruce!  Do you want me to spell it out for you?!? \nBRUCE backs off.  An awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine. \n", "test2_id": 1678, "test3_input": "TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. \nPENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? \nTIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want.  There's no need to -- \nPENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree.  You may go. \nTIPTREE stands.  He backs away from the suitcase warily. \nTIPTREE My family.  You won't -- \nPENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. \nTIPTREE We -- ?!?

TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nTIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam.  The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- \n-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE \nlooking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder.  He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- \n-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN.  The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job.  The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- \n-- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. \nThe smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks.  The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. \nCATWOMAN That idiot.  Another six feet -- \nPENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun.  -- He brought two ravens.  We've got a complete set! \nCATWOMAN What?? \nPENGUIN Yeah!  They're in the suitcase -- \nAn AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.  They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... \nCATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! \nThey pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives.  They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... \n...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE.  The kid takes off like a shot.  The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK \nThe bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.  He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. \nPAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK \nwatching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance.  He races back toward the scene of the melee... \nINT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT \n...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow.  He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.  She lifts a hand: no mas... \nHe looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.  Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... \n...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- \nThe CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.  He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT \nThe OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view.  The CENTER train is bearing down fast.  A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. \nHe stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions.  He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... \nINT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT \nBATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN.  She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. \nHER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.  As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... \nIt's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof.  But this time the results are altogether different.  He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. \nHis OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- \n-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! \nINT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK \nHe's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN.  Finally the center train passes -- \n-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly.  DICK TURNS TO RUN... \nA GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. \n", "test3_true": "CATWOMAN God.  Did you see him? Isn't he hot? \nPENGUIN Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot.  That was exhausting. \nCATWOMAN No pain, no gain!  -- Suck it up.  We're not out of here yet. \nShe sprints off down the tracks.  SQUAWKING, he waddles along behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him... \nAs they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back -- past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF TUNNELS -- \n-- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody.  He scans the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his gaze falls on DICK. \nHe limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all around him... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT \nThe stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL... \nINT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nA PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome.  We TILT DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT. \nThe PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a point directly under the dome.  There, encased in a plexiglass case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City Hall was erected.  He shouts up: \nPENGUIN LETS DO IT! \nINT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT \nThe CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony. Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a bronze bust.  The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families... \nThe CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly.  She removes the FIVE RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed bases.  She follows along behind them, replacing each bust with a RAVEN. \nWhen they're done, the PENGUIN yells up: \nPENGUIN Now.  Give each raven a quarter-turn. \nHis pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its recessed socket, in quick succession... \nINT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN \nThe moment of maximum tension.  He stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation.  SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing happens. \nCATWOMAN What happens now? \nPENGUIN I don't know.  That's all...! \nHe looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above.  He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen next.  Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING, flapping his arms like wings. \nPENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED!  It's a HOAX!  It's a -- \nHe SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK.  Somewhere behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind.  He spins and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass case... \nThe city model is TREMBLING slightly.  As he watches, the DOME of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model city -- POPS OFF on a hinge.  A METAL STRONGBOX rises into view... \nINT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT \nThe CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal box.  The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to get at the box. \nFRICK That's the treasure? \nCATWOMAN No.  It's a map... \nShe affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER. \nINT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN \nThe plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls through, landing atop Gotham City.  He snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus.  He's climbing down off the tabletop when the CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him. \nHe hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box.  He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS.  The CATWOMAN creeps over to his side: \nPENGUIN Bruce Wayne.  So he doesn't know a thing about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this.  It's right under Wayne Manor.  It's been there all along! \nNow the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS.  They show progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES -- an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION... \nPENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY \nTIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK.  He lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth; he moans slightly... \nHis eyes snap open suddenly.  He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a yelp. \nVICKI No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. \nHe pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway.  His shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling.  The pajamas he's wearing are three sizes too large.  He paces about, staring at his unfamiliar surroundings. \nVICKI (cont.) It's all right.  You're safe.  You can stay here as long as you need to. \nDICK I don't belong here.  You can't keep me here. \n", "test3_id": 1679}

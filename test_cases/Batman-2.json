THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nNOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON- PREFORMAT FONT \"BOOKMAN OLD\". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK \nIt's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over. \nChristmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham. Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue: \"JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till Christmas.\" \nThe streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven- year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously wants more. \nMom drags him off past another store window, this one full of SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading \"AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE BATWING -- $19.95 and up.\"  A PANHANDLER is perched at the entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this winter, Batmania is everywhere... \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nTwo hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME... \n...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather, they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to the few passersby. \nThey've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of \"Silent Night\" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time of year. \nA streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then -- \n-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM. \nEXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nAround the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT. \nCAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does... \nThe REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES. \nSIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing into a drift. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the Salvation Army SANTA... \n...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already burdened with LOOT. \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nMORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks. \nEXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nSNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out, another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches. \nThe ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are obviously going to get away clean -- unless... \nThe DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT... \nINT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nMORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief. \nBefore their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park. Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS. \nCOP What the hell -- ? \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nBRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading \"CLOSED TO TRAFFIC.\"  A huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the snowmobiles vanish into the trees. \nThe COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio mike: \nCOP WITH MIKE Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles! (pause) So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot?? \nALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of stopping... \nTHE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second later... \n...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the ice and snow on the paths before it into water! \nThe BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded: \nCOP I ...That was Batman. \nCOP II NO SHIT!! \nCOP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared a path, they might as well join in the chase... \nEXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT \nTWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the horizon... \nTV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall, with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER GORDON is reading from a prepared statement. \nGORDON After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000 in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force -- working in concert with Batman. \nAt the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the crowd: \nVOICES IN CROWD TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE -- \nGORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we saw in the park. \nGORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard over the din. \nGORDON I would like to stress -- that while this city enjoys a special relationship with Batman -- (louder) -- we do not condone vigilantism -- (practically screaming) -- IN ANY FORM. \nIt's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN \nThe evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a RED BERET as \"MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE BAT.\" \nSEKOWSKY And hey!  Where does this -- (BLEEP; expletive deleted) -- Gordon get off calling us ? We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all -- just like Batman. \nWOMAN IN CROWD You people are nothing but hoodlums! \nSEKOWSKY Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol riskin' our necks to protect old biddies like you. (into mike) If this lame-o Gordon could do his job -- \nMORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV screen, placing us in: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nwhere ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN. \nALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault. Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered the mike... \nSEKOWSKY (on TV) We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is alive in this city.  We're gonna take back the streets! \nSEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to chant: \"TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!\" Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and flicks it off. \nHe turns on the radio in search of something more soothing. \"Good King Wenceslas\" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a Sterling silver tea service. \nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a side drawer. \nThe drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads \"THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery. Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.\"  ALFRED digs around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at the rear of the drawer. \nGears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE STAIRWAY which descends into darkness... \nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nDescending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave. \"Good King Wenceslas\" is on the speakers down here as well. Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau, wrapped in a tarp. \nALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of BRUCE. \nALFRED Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE?? \nAs if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS. \nBRUCE I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you. \nHe's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater -- but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel, buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly regains his composure: \nALFRED I took the liberty of preparing tea. (indicating tbe monitors) I take it you've been watching the news? \nBRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview and nods. \nBRUCE Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world. \nBRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS, connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING. \nALFRED I should inform you...Christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund. (eyeing the equipment) If I may inquire...? \nBRUCE Oh, yeah.  Watch this. \nBRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect -- stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably like the skeleton of an umbrella. \nALFRED Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly  it? \nBRUCE What does it look like? \nALFRED To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella. \nSounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over, smiles slyly. \nBRUCE Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right. \nBRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap, pours a cup of tea. \nALFRED Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars... \nBRUCE We can do better than that. \nALFRED Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... \nT-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk.  TWO GUARDS arrive.  As they escort him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters: \nMR. BONIFACE You won't miss it long. \nEXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY \nIt's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading his wings, REVELING in the cold. \nA STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture- like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and umbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and \"business managers.\" \nFRICK Welcome back, Mr. Boniface. \nPENGUIN Mr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of planning are about to pay off. \nINT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY \nNow that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning to show.  His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity. \nPENGUIN I take it they found the money all right? \nFRACK We buried it exactly as you specified. \nPENGUIN How much have we got left? \nFRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET. \nFRICK Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent -- \nPENGUIN Fine, fine.  How much? \nFRICK Seventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the sum we buried. \nTHE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.  He checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE. \nPENGUIN Speaking of burials... \nEXT. PRISON YARD - DAY \nT-BONE on work detail.  He's got the Walkman on and he's shoveling snow to the beat.  He winces, and removes the headphones... \nThe MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie, high-pitched WHINE.  He's twisting the knob, trying to find the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT AT HIS HEAD. \nT-BONE HEY -- ! \nHe drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his head.  Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy. \nHe lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls, SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like rabbits, terrified... \nBy the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard, T-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming, man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings insanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs. \nAll at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing but ROCK MUSIC -- \"Surfin' Bird\" by the Trashmen.  Bird bird bird, bird is the word... \nEXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING \nAn AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison.  It disappears from view -- and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to Gotham City. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT \nALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.  She pulls him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek. \nVICKI Guess what, Alfred.  I think I found a present for Bruce. \nShe's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the exterior wall.  At first it doesn't want to fit through the door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help she gets it inside.  The faithful butler stares curiously at this odd-shaped gift... \nVICKI (cont.) Skis.  -- Don't let on, okay? \nALFRED He won't hear a word of it from me. \nVICKI He's such a nightmare to shop for.  -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred? \nALFRED (conspiratorially) I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment.  Let me put this under the tree... \nVICKI Not so fast. \nShe reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift.  ALFRED stares at the tag -- \"TO ALFRED, LOVE VICKI\" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN. \nALFRED Why, Miss Vale -- ! \nVOICE FROM BEHIND What's all this? \nALFRED and VICKI turn.  It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner, marching down the long stairway in the entry hall.  VICKI waves frantically. \nVICKI Don't look.  It's your present. \nVICKI rushes over to embrace him.  He gapes at the long skinny box -- \nBRUCE What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? \nVICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.  She nestles up against him.  WHISPERS in his ear: \nVICKI I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had. \nStill in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.  Taking the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box.  He backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him... \nINT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT \nFRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued plumage.  CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we can't see her face, there must be something distinctively feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she strolls past. \nFRICK opens a door and ushers her into... \nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nOur visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room. Her teeth begin to chatter.  The big bay windows have been thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's freezing in here. \nShe sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the cold.  He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the back of SELINA's hand. \nPENGUIN Ah, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet. \nSELINA At last we meet.  -- Pigeons? \nPENGUIN Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads.  May I? \nShe extends a SHOPPING BAG.  The PENGUIN removes a parcel and unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.  He sets it on a nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA. \nPENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated. \nSELINA I've located the others.  All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- ! \nWith an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut. \nPENGUIN My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees.  Germs find me inhospitable. \nSELINA I see why they call you the Penguin. \nPENGUIN They may call me that...but rarely more than once.  Champagne? \nShe nods.  He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a toast. \nPENGUIN (cont.) My dear.  Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nCOMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room. \nBULLOCK It wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. \nThey're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story. It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom: \nJULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio.  El murcielago. MURCIELAGO! \nGORDON What's that he keeps saying? \nBULLOCK \"Murcielago.\"  -- Bat. \nGORDON Nonsense.  That dock looked like a slaughter-house.  Batman's never committed murder. \nBULLOCK We did find this in his back pocket. \nBULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.  It reads: \"THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH\" -- and in lieu of a signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom corner. \nWhile GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in: \nPOLICEMAN Commissioner?  We've got Barrett. \nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT \nA cubicle down the hall.  The splenetic WALTER BARRETT, millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON enters. \nBARRETT Fine welcome.  These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this -- \nGORDON I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects. \nBARRETT Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room. \nGORDON weighs the threat.  He nods to the COPS in attendance... \nGORDON Book the son of a bitch. \nGORDON storms out.  BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the COPS restrain him.  Outraged, he bats their hands away... \nBARRETT I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY \nVICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.  She's standing behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown DEMOLITION SITE.  SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn with rubble.  The only structure still standing is a lone, decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above it, ready to strike. \nA SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION, INC.  Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE: \nSHAW Come on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour behind as it is!! \nA few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the condenmed building.  VICKI watches angrily... \nHER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS \nA quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling, clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.  Their few belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which the cops heave rudely out onto the street.  Finally, the handcuffs and nightsticks come out... \nShe hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left and right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN jumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and she VANISHES over the edge. \nSnapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in time to see -- \nEXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nShe's rapidly working her way down the side of the building, flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master gymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS -- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing BUS. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nBATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled upon it... \nLOOKING FOR LOVE? \nHe goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the entrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun, figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the face. \nEXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nDown below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view. \nCOP Hey.  You see what I saw...? \nThis sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK, who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out. \nBULLOCK It's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  -- We just made Batman up on the roof. \nGORDON Oh God. \nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.  A BLACK SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... \nWe TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at: \nEXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT \nThe little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park Towers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches. \nVICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken. \nVICKI Please, just one.  It's important for people to see what's happening. \nHOMELESS MAN They don't want to see us, lady.  They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better.  It always does. \nVICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and wailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd. All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables, RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos. \nSome of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. \nVICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come.  She backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film. \nA HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron -- sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture. He points her out to a colleague... \n...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers are almost upon her... \n...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold. \nThe second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. \nIn the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING the iron -- \n-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH- KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. \nThe FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with astonishment. \nIt's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed, grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... \nShe can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass -- spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once. There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle himself like this... \nRallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and race off to their VAN. \nTriumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. \nBut one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path -- TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at him... \nCLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over, BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there with a baseball bat. \nHe gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light out again when -- \nVICKI WAIT!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to thank you.  I -- \nKID (cautiously) Twenty. \nVICKI What? \nKID Twenty bucks. \nVICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same.  She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID snatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other for a long moment -- \nVICKI ...Who are you? \nKID Dick. \n-- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs into her CAMERA BAG... \nHER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS \nHer face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the page. \nBRUCE (cont.) \"Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were too.\" \nVICKI Is this some kind of bad joke? \nBRUCE It's her.  That cat woman, or whatever she is. (reading aloud) \"I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy...\" \nVICKI What does she want -- a date? \nBRUCE She's trying to contact me.  Says she's gonna leave me another ad... \nThe two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.  BRUCE's mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that makes VICKI just a trifle nervous... \nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY \nVICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.  She spots a message in the \"in\" file.  She takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with RAGE.  She storms out in a fury... \nINT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY \nBarging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe. He's just opening his mail.  He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI BARKS at him: \nVICKI WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY? \nPROVOST Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news.  With Shaw dead -- \nVICKI But the project's still going ahead!  If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is -- \nPROVOST There's a psycho out there in a mask and cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens!  That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His family is in mourning.  And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead. \nVICKI FUMES.  She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the eye. \nVICKI Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project? \nPROVOST Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark.  For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same. \nVICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.  He finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word \"CONFIDENTIAL\" underlined three times in ink.  He tears it open -- \n-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents: a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM... \nTHOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY \nWALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse.  BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS. \nREPORTER I Mr. Barrett!  Any comment on the arraignment? \nREPORTER II Is it true bail was set at two million dollars? \nATTORNEY Stand back!  My client has nothing to say at this time! \nThe ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a waiting CAR, shielding his face.  REPORTERS cluster around it... \nAs the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall of Justice. \nOVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR \nPIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is idling at a traffic light far below. \nINT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT \nThe liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change.  BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone. \nBARRETT It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society.  Get back to me... \nLooking troubled, he hangs up.  A fat white glob of PIGEON SHIT splatters across the windshield.  Seconds later -- another SPLAT. \nBARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons. \nDRIVER Just washed it, too. \nThe DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.  They hear a tiny DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield. \nBARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.  A small, blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade assembly... \nOVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR \nJust as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the intersection. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATCAVE - DAY \nTIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of BARRETT's car.  BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears behind him. \nALFRED The Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit. \nBRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED off. \nBRUCE Cancel. \nANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of \"millionaire murders,\" Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat. \nBRUCE How? \nSELINA Maybe by...coming here today. \nShe leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.  She's letting him have it with both barrels. \nSELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home. \nBRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.  He moves forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly closer... \n...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.  She backs off in shock as he covers his face.  His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING. She rushes over -- \nSELINA Are you okay? \nBRUCE Is there a cat in here? \nRight on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW -- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.  He brushes the animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.  BRUCE sniffles uncontrollably. \nBRUCE (cont.) Get it away! \nShe drops the cat, which scampers off.  BRUCE rubs his eyes. \nSELINA Poor thing.  You're allergic! \nBRUCE Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay... \nHe heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.  He's gone, but she knows she's left a dent in his armor.  She smiles in bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS. \nEXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated. He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE. \nHe opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been waiting for: \nTALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming. Why don't we trim the tree together? \nThis puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street. In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost fifty feet tall. \nThe LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.  BRUCE smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT \nSNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.  The tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric sheets. \nA BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.\"  The Square is rocking with good will toward men.  When they get to the part about saving us all from Satan's power -- \nEXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \n-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from his usual gargoyle's perch.  He's scanning the streets and the rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move -- whatever it is. \nHe glances at the building directly across the square from him.  On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL SCULPTURE of the world turning.  His eyes rove downward along the facade of the building... \nEXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT \nAt street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the Globe offices.  THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX handcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE. \nThe GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without incident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which reads: \nBATMAN: HERO OR MENACE? Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE! \nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN \nHe watches with some curiosity.  An armored car: is this some part of the CATWOMAN's scheme?  But no...the GUARDS are safely inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back to wait. \nINT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT \nThe innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe building.  FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the windshield. \nThey turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the fleet... \nINT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER \nThe quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office. The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway.  The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX -- sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents. \nSatisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY. \nPROVOST Open this in an hour.  Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it? \nLEAD GUARD No sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight from the bank vault. \nGUARD II 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN \n\"Here Comes Santa Claus\" echoes up from the streets.  BATMAN watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of the Globe... \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER \nPROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an elevator bank.  The other GUARDS head for a stairwell. \nGUARD II We'll check the stairs.  See you on the roof. \nThe LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST pulls a key from his pocket instead: \nNEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. \nPENGUIN Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. \nAs he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the other side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... \nPENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. \nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT \nPROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. \nPROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- \nPENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. \nPROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. \nPENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. \nCowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. \nPROVOST Who are you??  Why are you doing this?? \nINT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN \nBehind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. \nPENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. \nChuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. \nINT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT \nA SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. \nPROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... \nAll at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. \nINT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN \nPENGUIN Going down! \nHe hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. \nINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT \nThe RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... \nINT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT \nThe CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... \n...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. \nShe rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... \nShe makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. \nEXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN \nHe watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square.  Something weird is definitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post -- \n-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: \nCROWD Ten!  Nine!... \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND \nA ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the \"BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?\" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE \nEXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: \nCROWD ...Three!  Two!  One! \nThe CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of \"JINGLE BELLS.\" \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND \nThe NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... \nNEWS VENDOR Hey!  No!  I aleady got a -- \nHe spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door -- \nThe mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read \"BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE.\" \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING \nThe NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- \n-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!! \nEXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT \nThe first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a LAMPPOST and SKIDS.  The second car CRASHES INTO IT.  And the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto the immobilized squad cars. \nINT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT \nThe PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested. \nPENGUIN Look at that, boys -- they do flock together!! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nAMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK continues.  COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry.  PARAMEDICS drop the stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their heads... \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT \nBATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.  The roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the next, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go but down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to him -- \nCATWOMAN Ooh.  Where have you been all my life? \nHe edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. \nBATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE. \nBATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT \nStaring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping in the chill wind. \nEXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nShe's obviously making her getaway through the apartment. BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way down.  A sudden CRACK -- \nThe CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment.  Instead, she's followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF. \nEXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN \nHe plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.  The WHIP has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding tight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so. \nHe manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from moving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down to the pavement... \nEXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT \nShe's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.  With a cheshire- cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice. \nEXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT \nBATMAN hanging immobile.  Craning his neck, he can just see the \nRAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him... \nCATWOMAN (O.S.) Nevermore.  Nevermore! \nNow the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar. \nCATWOMAN Cute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over the fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. \nShe toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn.  BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes. \nCATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days.  Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships.  Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm just playful... \nBATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip.  She frowns and YANKS on it.  His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself. \nCATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to you! \nAngrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut him loose. \nANGLE ON BATMAN \nHe's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt. Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position.  He'll shoot it right through her if he has to... \nCATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats. \nANGLE ON CATWOMAN \nShe withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode. \nCATWOMAN Mice, really.  It's disgusting -- they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it.  Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different.  I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining.  I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you? \nBATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much longer.  And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly... \nCATWOMAN So I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you. \nAnd just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and FIRES. \nThe HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when -- \n-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice! \nCATWOMAN Gee...I'm so fickle. \nA QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly SEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten feet... \nEXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN \nPoking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING. \nA TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he spies something extremely odd -- \nIt's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial, \"R,\" in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement... \nThe roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING NOISE.  Someone's in the tunnel with him.  He lowers the costume abruptly -- \n-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff: \nDICK It's MINE! \nHe lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE -- \nEXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nA POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling. BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked smile comes to his face... \nOut here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.  The body armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view... \nAs a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange little boy's hands. \nThe kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head up and down.  Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to BRUCE. \nBRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and starts to move off. \nDICK NO.  WAIT! \nBRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP. \nThe KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view, he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK -- \n-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE makes haste in the opposite direction. \nEXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER \nBRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in the saddle. \nThe COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. \nA MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the horn and shouts out the window: \nCOP Dumb son of a bitch!! \nThe MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path. The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN \nA DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE BANDAGE. \nALFRED Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman. \nBRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS. \nBRUCE Great.  What'd you tell him? \nALFRED I told him that since you were Batman, you'd require no protection from Batman. \nBRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF PAIN. \nBRUCE Jesus, Alfred -- !! \nALFRED In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings. \nBRUCE It's just a few bruises. \nALFRED One bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire body. \nBRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's bag. \nBRUCE I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face -- \nALFRED I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the two of you move in the same circles. \nBRUCE -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman. \nALFRED Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming. \nINT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY \nIn a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side (or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one wall. \nThey peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE across the street... \nHIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT \nA UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals \"all clear\" to his counterpart watching from the house opposite. \nINT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT \nHe raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes a FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message: \nIF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD \nHe opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY \nBRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.  A BANNER HEAD-LINE shrieks: \nBATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy \nHe hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.  He gets up... \nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY \nBRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing her patetented thing on ALFRED. \nSELINA English accents are so stimulating. (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! \nALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.  He's about to break into a sweat.  He's eminently relieved when she turns and sees -- \nSELINA (cont.) Bruce! \nBRUCE Selina.  What are you doing here? \nALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.  She's on him like a barnacle. \nSELINA I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable.  How long have you had him? \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.  He glances back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around the corner. \nBRUCE You heard about Harry Provost. \nSELINA It's incredibly awful.  It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you. \nBRUCE Same here. \nSELINA It's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused.  Don't you think? \nBRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.  Everything gets her sort of aroused. \nINT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER \nSELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons.  She's like a kid in a toy shop. \nSELINA Bruce, this is incredible. (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ? \nBRUCE Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste. \nSELINA It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind.  I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay?  Promise you'll show me every inch of this place. \nPAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY \nINT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER \nALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer printout.  He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard. \nALFRED The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle. \nBRUCE (abstractedly) London...Cairo...Belgium... \nALFRED What exactly are you -- \nBRUCE Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it. \nALFRED You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or -- \nBRUCE Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven? \nALFRED Raven, sir? \nBRUCE That's what the Catwoman took from Provost.  A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable. \nHe continues to scan the screen.  ALFRED is suddenly lost in thought. \nALFRED How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but -- \nBRUCE What, Alfred? \nALFRED Your father had a raven, sir.  A small statue of the very sort you describe.  It used to sit on his desk. \nThis piques BRUCE's interest.  He swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at ALFRED. \nBRUCE What happened to it? \nALFRED After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago. \nBRUCE Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree? \nALFRED George Tiptree.  Your friend Elliott's father. \nTIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man.  He was an honorable man.  That's why they had him killed. \nCAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nQuick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.  THOMAS WAYNE lunging at him.  The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS. PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.  A second bullet felling his MOTHER -- \n-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN and GRIEF -- \nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE \n-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years later.  Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as TIPTREE finishes his tale. \nTIPTREE They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due.  Now the bill's come due. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK \nThe wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against the setting sun.  A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past... \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT \nBRUCE lies motionless on his bed.  Scattered about him are SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS which describe the murder of his parents.  Disoriented, he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no longer seem quite so familiar... \nHe folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down.  Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.  He makes no move to answer it. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK \nVICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.  ALFRED, who's in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone. \nALFRED Thank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance. \nVICKI I feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There must be something we can do. \nALFRED I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate --  or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain ways he will always be alone. \nBRUCE (O.S.) ...Thanks for the testimonial. \nALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring at him.  He starts to say something, but thinks better of it. He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down across from VICKI.  She extends a hand and he takes it -- making a visible effort to hold himself together. \nBRUCE Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be there when it happens. \nALFRED I see, sir.  When shall we expect you back? \nBRUCE Get your cap.  You're driving. \nINT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nIt's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.  The lights are on in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching TV. \nINT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nCHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed \"TO DADDY -- FROM SANTA.\" \nWith a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN STATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then slinks into the hallway... \nINT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown Christmas special on a portable TV.  One of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone, SUITCASE in hand... \nSTAKEOUT COP I Shit -- that's Tiptree!! \nThe COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of the brownstone. \nCOP Mr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you -- \nHEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine. TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a SUBWAY ENTRANCE. \nINT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT \nA VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS come racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor. They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE TURNSTILE -- \n-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform below. \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER \nTIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.  The doors slide shut behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as he rolls off. \nCOP We've gotta get back to the radio. \nINT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING \nTIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively. Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.  Derelicts, prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well- heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor... \nAn ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a DEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white CARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language. The other reads: \nDEAF AND DUMB PLEASE HELP -- $1.00 \nTWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type, stuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact -- \nTIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase. A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness. \nPENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens? \nTIPTREE The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want.  There's no need to -- \nPENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Tiptree.  You may go. \nTIPTREE stands.  He backs away from the suitcase warily. \nTIPTREE My family.  You won't -- \nPENGUIN We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration. \nTIPTREE We -- ?!? (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman. \nPENGUIN No.  I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out. \nINT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nTIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA, silhouetted in the flashlight beam.  The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down -- \n-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE \nlooking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross- girder.  He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat, WHIRLS SUDDENLY -- \n-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS at the PENGUIN.  The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella -- which happens to be a bulletproof job.  The PENGUIN lifts his brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft -- \n-- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of sparks. \nThe smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the tracks.  The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for signs of life. \nCATWOMAN That idiot.  Another six feet -- \nPENGUIN So sorry to spoil your fun.  -- He brought two ravens.  We've got a complete set! \nCATWOMAN What?? \nPENGUIN Yeah!  They're in the suitcase -- \nAn AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.  They see the lights of a TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track, where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag TIPTREE out of the train's path... \nCATWOMAN GIVE ME A HAND! \nThey pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives.  They stand against the outer wall, waiting for the train to pass... \n...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante -- standing on the inner track directly across from them. HOLDING THE SUITCASE.  The kid takes off like a shot.  The CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK \nThe bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.  He looks back over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast. \nPAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK \nwatching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance.  He races back toward the scene of the melee... \nINT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT \n...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for blow.  He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook, and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.  She lifts a hand: no mas... \nHe looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.  Before he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the last one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out of its path... \n...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side, and there's no place to go -- \nThe CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.  He LUNGES at her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer tunnel wall. \nINT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT \nThe OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and the CATWOMAN from view.  The CENTER train is bearing down fast.  A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on the innermost LOCAL TRACK. \nHe stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions.  He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead... \nINT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT \nBATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove -- there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing TRAIN.  She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT. \nHER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.  As they struggle, she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER... \nIt's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved him when he fell off the roof.  But this time the results are altogether different.  He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF THE TUNNEL. \nHis OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the rearmost car -- \n-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train! \nINT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK \nHe's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively to see what's become of BATMAN.  Finally the center train passes -- \n-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE -- smiling at him -- advancing menacingly.  DICK TURNS TO RUN... \nA GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA. \nVaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades, looks out at the grounds. \nVICKI It's \"Dick\", isn't it?  Or do you prefer \"Richard\"? \nHe stares at her as if she's nuts.  VICKI opens a closet door: all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the \"R\" insigne on the breast. \nVICKI \"R\" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit? \nDICK It's none of your business.  What is this, some kind of home? \nVICKI No, not that kind.  There's a swimming pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want. \nDICK Tennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How the hell would you know what I want? \nVICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.  He bats it away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation -- \nDICK I'm not staying.  You can't make me -- \n-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him. \nBRUCE I can make you. \nDICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized him.  The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.  I'm in Batman's house. \nBRUCE (cont.) Come on.  Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. \nALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table.  DICK edges toward it and sits down.  He waits for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE all the while. \nBRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here? \nVICKI nods yes.  BRUCE backs out of the room. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY \nBRUCE pulls the door shut.  ALFRED follows him down the hall. \nALFRED What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life? \nBRUCE I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other stuff to worry about. \nALFRED The child is hurt, sir.  At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents. \nBRUCE He hasn't got any parents. \nALFRED How do you know that, sir? \nBRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze. \nBRUCE ...I know. \nThe PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway. ALFRED picks up a hallway extension.  He covers the mouthpiece: \nALFRED Sir -- it's Miss Kyle. \nBRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call. \nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY \nARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.  A SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over her. \nSELINA Well!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we still on for tonight? \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE \nHe covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.  On his look we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT \nChristmas carols playing.  VICKI's got DICK helping her trim the tree. \nINT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA. \nALFRED Is this necessary, sir?  After all...it is Christmas eve. \nBRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.  He empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE CAPSULES.  He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits them in his jacket pocket. \nBRUCE Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat. \nALFRED I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir. \nBRUCE She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to take her out tonight. \nINT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV) \nDICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the bottom of the stairs.  The two of them exchange a few brief words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door. \nVICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of cheer as DICK turns discreetly away.  This is one weird household he's landed in... \nINT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT \nSOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in her own reflection.  She's looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low-cut gown.  She lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror: better.  She runs a hand through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look. \nFRICK Look at this.  He's a pillhead. \nNow FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an electronic device at the edge of the drive.  The gates magically part.  There's a large VAN just behind the car -- driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER \nVICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival.  She heaves a huge sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open. \nShe sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up. \nVICKI Ohh.  Am I glad to -- \nTo her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the floor, flat as a board.  VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters, throwing his arms wide. \nPENGUIN MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!! \nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nDICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.  He lets go and drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding again.  As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER coming from around the house. \nHe races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars out front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door. \nHis face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window. In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI surrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT \nVICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE. \nVICKI What did you do to him?? \nSELINA gives her a catty little smile. \nSELINA First-time jitters, I guess.  Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY \nDrawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the entry hall, pulling a robe around him.  He freezes in his tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front parlor, holding a gun to her head. \nPENGUIN You'd be the butler.  Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests? \nALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him.  He marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form. \nALFRED Mr. Wayne.  Is he -- ? \nPENGUIN You know how it is.  Some guys just can't hold their egg nog. \nINT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER \nThe PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's already assembled.  FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE inside. \nPENGUIN I should explain the occasion of our visit.  There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it.  Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale? \nVICKI I don't know what you're talking about. \nPENGUIN The cave.  Under the house.  How do I get there? \nThe PENGUIN gestures.  FRICK holds the gun to her head. \nVICKI (cont.) I don't know!  I swear, I would tell you -- \nPENGUIN (turning to ALFRED) Then maybe you'd like to tell me. \nALFRED You're no more than a common thief. \nPENGUIN Wrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year? \nFRICK cocks the gun.  VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans the room, weighing his options.  Trembling, he shuts his eyes -- \nALFRED I...don't...know... \nPENGUIN Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the tree. \nFRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.  VICKI winces.  ALFRED starts to blurt something out.  But a split-second before he can speak -- \nSELINA Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. \nThe PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.  ALFRED and VICKI heave simultaneous sighs of relief.  He throws her a shamefaced look -- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play. \nSELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself.  So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas. \nThe PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on the floor.  He turns to FRICK and FRACK. \nPENGUIN Why don't you two tie up our host? \nALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the premises.  FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in. \nINT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT \nThey dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet. \nINT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE \nStill holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects. \nPENGUIN It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. \nBRUCE I can't...get down there...without you. \nDICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE. \nINT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT \nWe will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt. \nPENGUIN What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do. \nVICKI SHUT UP.  Help me with him. \nThe PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give VICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls FRACK aside. \nPENGUIN You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair? \nFRICK Yes sir. \nPENGUIN Oh, good.  That does relieve my mind -- \nHe turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT CORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face. \nPENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne??? \nINT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT \nDICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry. \nThen he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind BRUCE and looks on, dazzled. \nINSERT - MONITOR \nThe screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors. \nPENGUIN Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far. \nBACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE \nHe turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and waits. \nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly -- \n-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor! \nINT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT \nThe PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside. He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in here... \nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER \nDICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down below. \nBRUCE -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal.  You know what to do. \nDICK nods yes and bolts off. \nINT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER \nVICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy- fingered. \nSuddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- \"SANTA BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME.\"  FRICK turns and stares at it in confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls -- \n-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the loudspeakers. \nBRUCE (O.S.; filter) VICKI!  RUN!  NOW! \nShe's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall. FRICK turns and takes aim -- \n-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it over... \nINT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT \nVICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is sealing itself off! \nINT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT \nDICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker. \nHe bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa. \nDICK Here.  You might need it. \nALFRED Thank you, Master Dick.  And...bravo. \nINT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT \nVICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a dial tone -- \nVOICE FROM BEHIND Do you really think we're that stupid? \nVICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is SELINA's. \nSELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!! \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER \nThe PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER \nAt the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are VICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a VOICE: \nPENGUIN Such primitive entertainment. \nHe's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave. His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its little plateau. \nPENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to shoot you both. \nHe pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave. He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of the cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below. \nPENGUIN The Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to be stolen twice. \nALFRED Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here. \nPENGUIN Oh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we?  You go first. \nHe shoves her.  She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her head. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT \nSELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter- speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path. \nHe's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs it in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh. \nSELINA It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up. \nBATMAN It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any more. \nSELINA Tell me something -- one thing.  If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? \nHe just looks at her.  He doesn't have an especially good answer.  She sighs. \nSELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men. \nShe SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat. As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling -- \n-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up a GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which suspends the chandelier. \nThe chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it -- and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry hall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. \nBATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat.  He stands over her; she glares up at him. \nBATMAN Nine lives. \nCATWOMAN I can't move.  I can't move. \nHer face is cut and bleeding.  She tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it.  He crouches down beside her, still cautious... \nCATWOMAN (cont.) DON'T LOOK AT ME!! (pleading) Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want.  Please? \nBATMAN looks up.  DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do. \nBATMAN No. \nBATMAN slowly rises to his feet.  She lets out another gruesome WHINE. \nCATWOMAN COME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch.  You're all alike... \nHer STEEL CLAWS snick into place.  With an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to slit her own throat. \nHe reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and breaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered glass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. \nBATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to join him. \nDICK You should've done it, man.  You should've killed her. \nBATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing. \nBATMAN There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send for help. \nINT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER \nThe PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK FORMATION.  A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope. \nThey're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS. \nPENGUIN Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at you now.  Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off. \nThe PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they climb the last few feet toward the grotto.  BATMAN swings his cape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a cautious step backward. \nCLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND \nHis free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open. \nANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI \nThey've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks. \n", "test1_input": "COP II You.  SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out?? \nJOGGER A kid.  Thirteen or fourteen tops.  He just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face. \nNearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who responds with a mystified shrug.  Her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER. \nAn exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime site: \nRED BERET I Dumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you.  It's fulla bums. \nBRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he passes. \nBRUCE Nice outfit. \nRED BERET I Piss off, geek. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT \nSnow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor. FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS -- totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar: the WHARF RAT. \nINT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT \nA roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo.  A TV over the bar is tuned to the late news: \nANCHORWOMAN ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe... \nThe BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.  None, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. \nMoments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely Eurasian features.  She's dark and elegant, fine- boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know it yet, is SELINA KYLE. \nShe's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. \nThe regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.  The only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY, who's still on the phone: \nRICKY Yo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps? \nIn mid-conversation he notices SELINA.  She smiles invitingly -- right at him.  Mildly startled, he smiles back. \nRICKY (cont.) Midnight.  No sweat.  See you then. \nHe hangs up eagerly.  Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar. \nSELINA Well.  \"Ricky,\" is it? \nRICKY How'd you know that? \nSELINA I heard you on the phone.  Talking to your girlfriend. \nRICKY Girlfriend?  No, no.  That was business. \nSELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves. \nSELINA If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink. \nShe clasps his hand.  His EYES BUG OUT.  Three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone.  RICKY gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled. \nRICKY Jeez -- they look almost real. \nSELINA Why wouldn't they be? \nRICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident.  He swallows hard and tries not to stare. \nRICKY You'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this. \nSELINA Oh, they're real, all right.  So are these. \nShe waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp -- in front of his eyes.  With lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand. \nSELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.  He tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip.  Then -- her dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a coy, Cheshire-cat smile. \nSELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink? \nHe blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.  She takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at the blood.  RICKY is hypnotized. \nShe's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow -- intriguing.  He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the BARTENDER. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT \nJust after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.  A small STEAMBOAT is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS -- mean, ugly, and heavily armed. \nA similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet them on the dock below.  The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.  Something major is about to happen... \nThe CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a black MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the gangplank. \nThroughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to a colleague: \nDOCK GOON I Where's that goddam Ricky? \nDOCK GOON II Probably out gettin' laid.  And here we are freezin' our balls off... \nEXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "BOAT THUG I You pick. \nThe CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.  Two BOAT THUGS tip it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM -- revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER. \nPOV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nWe're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at water's edge.  Down on the deck of the steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the merchandise. \nLIEUTENANT It's pure. \nREVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nA BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof. The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY EARS... \nCHIEF GOON (O.S.) Let's do it. \nHe gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook. \nBOAT THUG I Hold it.  Let's see the money. \nDown on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it.  Lots of long green inside.  The BOAT THUG signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank. \nLOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT \nThe goon with the suitcase marches up.  Beyond him, in the distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the CRANE. \nANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nThe moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier. \nANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT \nRazor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the air. \nON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nThe netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.  The crates explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic. \nON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT \nNobody knows quite what's going on.  Panicking, the GOON with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank.  BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick shot.  Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the drink, suitcase and all. \nPandemonium.  All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.  Thinking he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range. \nBOAT THUG I YOU SON OF A BITCH! (to another BOAT THUG) Go after it.  Get the money.  GO!! \nHe raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys -- diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.  Everyone's ducking for cover.  BOAT THUG I barks orders at the pilothouse: \nBOAT THUG I Soltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!! \nANOTHER BOAT THUG LOOK! \nBOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS. \nShe bares her teeth and HISSES. \nIt's a woman. \nBOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke, RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps to the deck, lifeless. \nThe other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him toppling into the water. \nThe gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier. \nMost of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky specimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more reeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up action takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she stands back to survey the scene. \nCounting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow is speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down and softly MOANING. \nRetracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested. Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the sides of the crates. \nShe finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.  She opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection.  The statuette of a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the moonlight. \nThe WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the MOANING PUNK's back pocket.  Then, cradling the raven under one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet. \nA LANTERN approaches.  It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the sight of the carnage on the docks.  He kneels beside the moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS. \nPUNK Murcielago.  MURCIELAGO!! \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT \nThe unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them, all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on special perches mounted in the walls. \nAt the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL. ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water. Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the Gotham Zoological Gardens. \nA MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface.  It's not a whale; it's too pink.  It is, instead, the PENGUIN -- and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK standing in the open doorway. \nFRICK Mr. Boniface?  Your...visitor has arrived. \nPENGUIN Thank you, Mr. Frick.  Show her in. \nThe PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool.  Two of his LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain, into place over his head.  He grasps it with both hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water. \n", "test2_input": "CITY OFFICIAL I Street punks are one thing, Jim.  This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine! \nAs the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.  We see the tiny TRADEMARK embossed on the CPU -- \"WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES.\" \nINT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE \nas he LISTENS through his concealed bug. \nCITY OFFCIAL II You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning.

GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT \nThe BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.  After a beat, the CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past. \nINT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT \nTWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE whizzes past on the street.  The DRIVER pulls out behind it as the second COP grabs his radio mike... \nCOP One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat \nVOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37.  Backup on the way. \nEXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE \nBARRELING TOWARD US on the street.  The SQUAD CAR gains behind it.  A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash... \nThe BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES. \nOVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS \nAs the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the pursuit.  All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE DRIVERS... \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift roadblock.  ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them. They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them... \nANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT \nThe FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself from the body of the car.  It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER. \nEXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK \nA SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.  The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING UP and dive for the sidewalk.  The COW-CATCHER slams into the SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises through the gap. \nAs the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby building -- \nEXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT \n-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot, because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the action with some dismay. \nHis relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky ground.  He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL UNIT: \nBATMAN Evasive. \nSIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAt this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.  We're in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction magnate.  There's obviously money to be made in real-estate development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in Gotham. \nAt the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.  An UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back to the camera... \nWOMAN It's a fake. \nSHAW Hmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure? \nWOMAN Absolutely.  You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed. \nThe WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.  He seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind.  CAMERA STAYS ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest. \nSHAW I guess you'd know.  I have some \"friends\" in the art world.  They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call. \nWOMAN (O.S.) How flattering. \nSHAW They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall. \nWOMAN (O.S.) Mr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you hear? \nSHAW Oh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people who take what they want.  I'm just curious how you do it. \nSHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face.  It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa... \nSELINA I find that the old methods work best. \nSetting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep, passionate kiss.  Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor. \nINT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS, twisting them around into tight cords.  With a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on the bedpost. \nSHAW Hey, what are you doing -- ? \nHe tries to break her grip.  She BACKHANDS him sharply across the face. \nSELINA You're very inquisitive.  You'll just have to be disciplined. \nAn EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost.  None too quick, he's just caught on that all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene.  She crosses quickly to the bathroom -- \nSHAW You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before. \n-- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems perfectly appropriate in this context. \nSELINA I think people should indulge their fantasies.  Don't you? \nNow that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag.  She withdraws an odd-looking chromium BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger.  SIX- INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place.  SHAW's dopey smile fades... \nSHAW Hey, what are those -- what are you -- \nHe lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby.  A SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT \nA SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the entrance of the building.  Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show various empty hallways throughout the building.  He reaches for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel nearby. \nINT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT \nThe penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a BURGLAR ALARM.  SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE -- concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of complete exasperation: oh, shit.  The GUARD'S VOICE crackles over a nearby intercom: \nGUARD (O.S.; filter) Mr. Shaw?  What's going on up there?  -- Mr. Shaw? \nFurious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on the docks.  She slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place. \nEXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nSIRENS echo in the streets.  SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and streak off toward SHAW's building. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT \nWatching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head.  An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency: \nDISPATCHER (O.S.; filter) -- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at Gotham Park West.  Move out.  It's Randall Shaw.  Repeat, all units -- \nBATMAN's eyes widen.  He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo. \nBut it's no umbrella.  When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding -- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS. \nHe steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise past far below. \nINT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThere's an awful BANGING at the front door.  SHAW lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling.  SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders.  She picks up the nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. \nTen seconds later the COPS burst in.  They rush to the bedroom -- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed -- \n-- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT. \nCOP JESUS! \nEXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nForty stories up.  The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF.  She scampers across the rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle, like a mountain climber -- \n-- until she reaches the building at the end of the block. Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack.  She pulls out a retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around, HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street... \nEXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT \nPOLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the intersection. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT \nThe CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger.  Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure.  She's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of Quality Time. \nShe hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.  Her whole body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes dart left. \nA CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line. The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows.  She acts like she hasn't noticed... \n...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. \nTIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT \nHis eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.  If it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. \nHIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT \nShe still doesn't let on that she's seen him.  Instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT \nHis jaw is down around his knees.  Whoa.  He edges forward slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her... \n", "test3_input": "SELINA Our absentee board member!

I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected. \nBRUCE Sorry to disappoint you. \nSELINA Oh, it's not that.  Not at all.  It's just that I'd always heard you were... \nBRUCE What? \nSELINA (coyly) Oh...sort of a... \nBRUCE (smiling; fascinated) No.  Come on.  What? \nBRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially -- takes his other arm.  The women exchange big, toothy, plastic smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting for him to introduce them. \nBRUCE Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale. \nSELINA The photographer.  I've seen your pictures in the Gazette. \nVICKI The Globe. \nSELINA Oh, that's right.  The tabloid one.  -- What an original dress! \nVICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.  He senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass. \nBRUCE Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone. \nVICKI Really.  She must be awfully tired. (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this? \nSELINA It was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah. \nShe laughs at her own joke.  VICKI responds with a dry little chuckle of her own.  SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the sleeve. \nSELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have some boring museum business to talk about. \nVICKI fumes.  BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him off out of earshot. \nSELINA (cont.) I.  Short leash. \nBRUCE Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really terrific. \nSELINA I'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you.  Come by sometime.  I'll give you the private tour. \nBRUCE Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki -- \nSELINA (shushing him) I understand.  Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it. \nShe shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial, unmistakably juicy.  Then she's off in pursuit of another major funder.  BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when VICKI rejoins him. \nVICKI How's \"business\"? \nBRUCE Relax, okay?  I like you better. \nHe scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.  No luck. \nVICKI If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nThe roof of the Gotham Globe.  A STARLING circles overhead for a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT. \nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT \nTWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office. Brass letters on the door read \"J. HARRISON PROVOST, PUBLISHER.\" \n", "test3_true": "PROVOST, agitated, working late.  He speaks, sotto voce, into the phone: \nPROVOST Don't worry about that.  I've had the office swept for bugs.  No one's listening... \nINT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTIPTREE in his paneled study at home.  There's an open bottle on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard.  His VOICE QUAVERS: \nTIPTREE It's just so -- unfair.  I mean...it was over a century ago.  It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know?  How could Batman know about the Raven Society?? \nINT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT \nPROVOST Who knows and who cares.  The point is, it's happened... \nHe hears a CHIRP and looks up.  It seems to be coming from a HEATING VENT on the wall.  But then it stops, so he resumes his conversation -- \nPROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me.  I suggest you do the same. \nINT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT \nIn the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft.  Now that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE taped to its leg. \nPROVOST (O.S.) I'll tell you how to reach me.  And don't repeat this to anyone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY \nThe PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool.  He's wearing rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his arctic birds.  The vents in the windows are open, and the climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in fur, stroking her pet cat: \nSELINA He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned. \nPENGUIN Then he is an idiot. \nSELINA He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed. \nPENGUIN How do you plan to do that? \nSELINA How do you think! \nA feline smile from SELINA.  The PENGUIN chuckles to himself, lobs a FISH out over the pool.  A swooping GULL snatches it out of the air before it hits the water.  FRICK arrives in the doorway. \nFRICK It's Mr. Provost, sir.  He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation. \nPENGUIN Good!  That should save us a trip to the bank. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY \nA huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk: archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over.  This is SELINA's private domain.  CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens... \nBRUCE What have we got here? \nSELINA Mummified cats.  Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis.  -- Oh, careful! \nBRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen JARS.  Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape, jackal, man, falcon. \nSELINA (cont.) Canopic jars.  In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine -- \nBRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder. \nBRUCE You're in a gruesome line of work. \nSELINA Keeps me interested.  And that's not easy to do... \nBRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON. \nBRUCE This one I know.  It's a gryphon, right? \nSELINA Very good.  A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice. \nBRUCE nods.  He can dig it.  He regards the gryphon for a long moment and CHUCKLES. \nBRUCE Poor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate. \nSELINA Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce.  I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression. \nBRUCE What was it you wanted to talk to me about? \nSELINA Your collection.  I'd love to see it.  I mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- \nShe breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself.  She toys demurely with her equipment.  She looks up at BRUCE and switches tactics -- going for the direct approach.  BRUCE braces himself... \nSELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again.  Does she know you're here -- Vicki? \nBRUCE (shrugging) No. \nSELINA It must be strange.  Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to. \nBRUCE What are you attracted to? \nSELINA I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life.  Having everything you want.  No variety, no...danger.  And every once in a while you need to take a risk.  Shake it all up. \n"}

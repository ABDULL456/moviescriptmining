COMMISH What? 
JACKIE MOON Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums, the economic... (a little lost) Growing... package... inventions... 
WINNING OWNER #1 (correcting him) Economic growth pack-- 
JACKIE MOON 
I KNOW WHAT I SAID! (to the room) The four teams with the best records should merge. 
LOSING OWNER #2 He's right. 
LOSING OWNER #1 Yeah, that's the fairest way. 
COMMISH These four teams DO have the best records. Flint's only won six games all year! 
JACKIE MOON So far. The season isn't over. 
LOSING OWNER #2 Yeah, maybe we should finish the season first. 
COMMISH This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but it's too late. The commissioner, me, has already decided. 
LOSING OWNER #2 Actually, the terms of a merger can only be approved by a league mandate. 
JACKIE MOON YES. That's right. What he said. 
LOSING OWNER #1 I move that we vote on the terms of the merger. 
EXT. FLINT MICHIGAN FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT DAY 
The team sits around the parking lot, sitting on their duffle bags, dejected. Jackie is having a team meeting. 
JACKIE MOON C'mon you guys, let's try to stay psyched. This is a chance to become a real NBA franchise! 
CLARENCE There's no way we can make it to fourth place. It's mathematically impossible. 
JACKIE MOON I ran the numbers. All we have to do is win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games. 
CLARENCE Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a lot? 
JACKIE MOON Oh, c'mon! We just gotta start hitting our threes. (guys look around, unsure) Listen, I know this seems like bad news, but it doesn't have to be. This is a big road trip for us. We've just got to start playing solid Flint basketball. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY I don't know. We suck, man. 
JACKIE SLAPS SCOOTSIE. 
JACKIE MOON (re: The slap) Sorry. 
JACKIE SLAPS HIM AGAIN, HARDER. 
JACKIE MOON We do not suck, okay? We just have to want it! 
Pumped, Jackie walks around with his hands on his hips. 
BEE BEE ELLIS What do you think, Monix? All eyes turn on the grumpy one. 
MONIX I think we suck. 
JACKIE MOON Well... See, now there's some team unity! Now let's load up the jet. REVEAL: A SHITTY SCHOOL BUS has the words 'THE JET!' Spray- painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it. 
JACKIE MOON (as they load up) Now we've got a special treat. You know I take care of my family. Today, the Jet is catered. I had Downtown's Mom pack us some hot dish. 
BEE BEE ELLIS Ms. Quincy's hot dish? Sweet! 
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
The guys load up. It's so packed it's ridiculous. Everyone tries to stuff their gear somewhere and sit down. Jackie carries a big pot of hot dish, accidentally burning Scootsie's back. 
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Ah, watch the hot dish, man. 
JACKIE MOON Sorry Scootsie. 
TWIGGY MUNSON Hey Jackie, there's some dude out there, wants to talk to you. POV: Out the window, we can see DUKES, the full court shot winner, holding his GIANT CHECK and looking into the bus. He's still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER

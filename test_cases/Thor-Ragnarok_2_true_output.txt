Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts the towel over his head. 
BANNER What are you doing with that? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                83. 
THOR I need a disguise.    I'm a fugitive. 
BANNER I need a disguise. 
THOR You are the disguise. 
Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket. 
BANNER I'll be Tony Stark. 
THOR What? 
BANNER Yeah.   Tony and the gypsy. 
THOR No, no you're not Tony.    You're Bruce Banner. 
BANNER Then why did you dress me up like Tony? 
THOR Because you were naked. 
BANNER Okay, I'll give you that. 
They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch. 
THOR What are you doing?    Stop doing that! 
BANNER Tony wears his pants super tight! 
THOR Why are you being so weird? 
BANNER I don't know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird. 
Banner flashes green.    Thor calms him down. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                84. 
THOR Hey. It's okay. You're good. Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right? 
BANNER All right. 
WHAP!   Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint. 
Caught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into- 
69A   EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS                              69A 
It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE! 
Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward. 
Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and pulls him into another alley, but sees- 
-Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley! 
THOR This is bad. Banner!     Banner! 
Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright. 
Thor sees Banner across the crowd. 
Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively, awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders. 
One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner. 
WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS. 
Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child. 
THOR (CONT'D) Hi. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16               85. 
VALKYRIE Hi. 
THOR I was gonna do that. 
VALKYRIE Yeah, well, I did it first. 
THOR That's good. What are you doing here? 
VALKYRIE What are you doing here?   I thought you were leaving. 
THOR I got sidetracked. 
VALKYRIE What's with the... 
THOR It's my disguise. 
VALKYRIE But I can see your face. 
THOR (covers his face) Not when I do this, you can't. (then:) Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe? 
Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm. 
BANNER (to Thor:) What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she's killed? She's so beautiful and strong... 
69B   EXT. SAKAARIAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER                        69B 
Valkyrie escorts Thor and Banner through the street. 
VALKYRIE Who is this guy? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16            86.

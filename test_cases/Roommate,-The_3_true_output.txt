SARA What happened to Tracy? Kim shrugs. 
KIM I'm the worst roommate ever. Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which Stephen notices. 
STEPHEN Do you want to look for your friend? Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods. 
INT. STAIRCASE 
They spot Tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom of the stairs. Sara rushes over to her. A couple frat boys stand over her. Not sure what to do with her. 
SARA 
(BUTTS IN) I got her. 
She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat boys notice her struggling. 
FRAT BOY #1 Who's got you? Tracy nearly brings Sara down to the floor... But Stephen's there to catch her. 
STEPHEN Guess that would be me. But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both. 
SARA Who's got you? Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around Sara's waist. 
STEPHEN 
(SMIRKS) Apparently God. Sara rolls her eyes. 
INT. CARNEGIE DORM - NIGHT 
Sara, Stephen, and Tracy stumble into the dorm lobby. Sara wears a jacket Stephen gave her for the walk. Kim and ANOTHER GIRL step forward and grab Tracy. 
KIM Thanks Sara. 
SARA No problem. They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into the elevator. Holding it for Sara. 
KIM You want us to wait? Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen. 
STEPHEN You know, I'm going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party. It's like opposite everything we stand for. Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but her lips still very close to his. 
SAEA (low and romantic) Does that make it worth it? 
STEPHEN Honestly, no. She laughs out loud. 
SARA Do you want to come up? 
STEPHEN 
(DEEP BREATH) More than I can tell you, but that wouldn't be fair. Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her. 
STEPHEN Keep it... till next time. 
SARA Thanks again. For everything. 
(BEAT) And, sorry about kitchen duty. He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which suddenly makes her a little more queasy. 
INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Sara heads for her room, holding onto the wall as she goes. She reaches her door. She takes one more deep breath, then opens it. 
INT. ROOM 316 - NIGHT 
Sara closes the door behind her. Almost pitch black; just a little moonlight through the window. Sara knocks into her lounge chair. 
SARA Ow! She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may puke at any second. She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing: The other bed. Sara screams. 
GIRL Hi. FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and disorienting Sara.

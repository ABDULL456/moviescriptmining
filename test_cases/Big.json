If a kid likes a toy it sells. That's all! \nSUSAN But every bit of research and focus testing... \nMR. M It works with research, it works with focus testing, it just doesn't work with the kids! \nJOSH Sorry!  I'm sorry! \nPAUL Why don't you watch where the hell you're going! \nMR. M Only what? \nJOSH Well, the pieces don't move. \nMR. M What do you mean? \nJOSH Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and now all they do is spin around.  It was more like real hockey the old way.  Why did they change it? \nMR. M I don't know. \nJOSH You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the pieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, and they don't come with a vehicle. \nMR. M I see. \nJOSH Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat! \nMR. M Okay, let's check out the...Piano lessons? \nJOSH Three years. \nMR. M Me too.  Everyday, after school....Chopsticks....What department did you say you were in? \nJOSH Oh, I'm in computers. \nMR. M Computers?  You just saved me a trip to the gym Son. \nSCENE 34 \nSUSAN Vice President in charge of Product Development. \nPAUL Vice President!  He's only been here a week!  Vice President?! \nSUSAN And he came from data processing! \nPAUL He's out of his mind!  The old man has finally lost it! \nSUSAN Did you know they gave him Bob's old office? \nPAUL Bob's office?!  Bob's office is bigger than my office!  There's got to be a reason.  Things like this don't happen unless there's a reason. \nSCENE 35 \nBILLY You're the luckiest guy I know. \nSCENE 36 \nPAUL Did you check Mattel? \nSUSAN Nothing. \nPAUL Colleco? \nSUSAN Zero. \nPAUL He can't come from nowhere Susan.  He has to come from somewhere.  How about Hasbro? \nSUSAN Yes.  And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.  I have called everywhere. Nobody's ever heard of him! \nPAUL Great! \nSUSAN Face it Paul.  The guy comes from data processing. \nPAUL Terrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific! \nSUSAN You're being paranoid Paul. \nSCENE 37 \nPAUL These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds. When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes? \nJOSH I don't get it. \nPAUL What exactly don't you get? \nJOSH It turns from a building into a robot, right? \nPAUL Precisely. \nJOSH Well, what's fun about that? \nPAUL Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 percent in the last two years.  There, that might help. \nJOSH Oh. \nSUSAN They were so, incisive.  It's Beluga.  Macmillan orders it every year....You all right?  You okay?  You want a glass of water?  You want something to drink? \nJOSH Could I have a milkshake or something? \nSUSAN I've got a car outside.  You want to get out of here? \nJOSH Uh Huh. \nSUSAN Let's go. \nSCENE 45 \nSUSAN I'm not really a big one for parties.  You know, I like things that are a little more intimate. \nJOSH Wow!  Is this your car? \nSUSAN Well, it's the company's car. \nJOSH Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen! \nSUSAN I mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a chance to know them.  I mean, just being with you here tonight, I really get a sense of who you are. \nJOSH Are you gonna eat these fries? \nSUSAN No. No.... \nJOSH Hey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat them. \nDRIVER No, thank you. \nSUSAN You see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this invisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you going to call someone before...? \nJOSH No. \nSUSAN Uh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the radio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now!  You know...I mean, I love my job and I.... \nJOSH Ejector seat!  This is great!  Hey!  Come on up!  Hey, that was my apartment. \nSUSAN Really?  I'd love to see where you live. \nSCENE 46 \nJOSH They rigged this up so you don't need any quarters....Don't!  Don't...! \nSUSAN What? \nJOSH The glue's not dry.  Sorry. \nSUSAN Sorry. \nJOSH It's okay....You wanna play pinball? \nSUSAN No. \nJOSH You don't need quarters for this either.  It's free. \nSUSAN No, thank you. \nJOSH Okay. \nSUSAN Is that a trampoline? \nJOSH Yeah.  You wanna try it? \nSUSAN No. \nJOSH You should.  It's really fun.  It's simple, too.  Come on!  Come on! You'll like it and it's really easy to do. \nSUSAN No, I don't think... \nJOSH I'm serious... \nSUSAN Do have some wine? \nJOSH Take off your shoes...It's really easy....Let me get rid of these balls. \nSUSAN No, I'm...I'm...I'll watch. \nJOSH Come on.  It's fun.  I'll do it with you.  Up you go.  Excellent. \nSUSAN Help me up? \nJOSH Sure. \nJOSH Wouldn't you rather play basketball?  I know how to play that.  We could be like a team for the Macmillan Company. \nPAUL No. \nJOSH I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try.  My best sport is video hockey. \nPAUL That isn't a sport. \nJOSH Well, it takes eye to hand coordination. \nPAUL It's not a sport if you don't sweat! \nJOSH What about golf?  You don't sweat and that's a sport. \nPAUL Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the work! \nJOSH What about car racing? \nPAUL Aw shut up Baskin! \nJOSH What are the rules again? \nPAUL I told you.  Over the line to serve.  Yellow is out of bounds.  Play to 21--ready? \nJOSH Sorry.  Sorry. \nPAUL One nothing.  Come on!  Get it!  Get it!  Get it! \nJOSH Okay. \nPAUL Thatta boy!  Okay, you ready?

You said it had to be over the line on a serve. \nPAUL No I didn't. \nJOSH Yeah you did!  You said it had to be over the line on a serve! \nJOSH Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that. \nSUSAN You don't...you don't know me that well. \nJOSH Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met. \nSUSAN How do you do it? \nSCENE 52 \nPAUL What's this? \nSUSAN What does it look like?!  Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape!  Oh, and I want my keys back! \nPAUL Sure.  It's just some scratches.  He'll get over it. \nSUSAN Oh, it has nothing to do with him. \nPAUL Oh come on Susan!  He's just another link in the chain!  First it was Tom Caulfield, then Handlen.  Then Golding, then me!  Am I missing somebody? \nSUSAN It's not like that anymore! \nPAUL What is so special about Baskin? \nSUSAN He's a grown up! \nPAUL Susan. \nSUSAN I can't believe you brought up Golding. \nSCENE 53 \nBILLY And many more!

Okay.  One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that quarter.  Just as four.... \nWOMAN You're right.  He's wonderful! \nSUSAN I know. \nSCENE 63 \nBILLY Department of Consumer Affairs?

M Maybe next year, all right?  Next year. \nSCENE 65 \nSUSAN You can do it.  I know you can! \nJOSH I cannot plan a whole line! \nSUSAN Why?  Nobody knows more about toys in the entire company! JOSH Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that! \nSUSAN All he wants is a proposal! \nJOSH I can't! \nJOSH Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday... \nWOMAN Mr. Baskin can't be disturbed! \nJOSH Yeah, I have the Keating example right here... \nBILLY Where've you been?  I've been trying to reach you forever! \nJOSH Shh!  I'm right in the middle of something okay? \nBILLY That's the list.  All you've got to do is call! \nJOSH Can you give me just a minute, please? \nBILLY What are you talking about?  This is the list! \nJOSH Would you come back at lunch?  All right, I'm a little bit busy right now...Hello? \nBILLY Busy?! \nJOSH Billy! \nBILLY Are you out of your mind?! \nJOSH Jesus, Billy!

You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was about to rip your head off! \nJOSH You don't get it, do you?  This is important! \nBILLY I'm your best friend.  What's more important than that, huh?  I'm three months older than you are--asshole! \nSCENE 69 \nSUSAN Oh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside of me, too! \nJOSH No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up. \nSUSAN Oh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why are you doing this Josh? \nJOSH There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine... \nSUSAN Oh stop it! \nJOSH It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just a kid! \nSUSAN Fine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep. \nSCENE 70 \nBILLY Josh?  Josh!  Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin. \nMOM Hi.

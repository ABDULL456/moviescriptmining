ROBERTA What are you doing? 
BRIAN I've been waiting to do that since Mr. Baines' orchestra class. 
ROBERTA You didn't even notice me! 
BRIAN Sure I did. You used to ignore me and it drove me wild. 
ROBERTA You had at least five different girlfriends. 
BRIAN It didn't mean I had the one I wanted. 
He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her rollers. 
BRIAN You're not a navy wife anymore... 
He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him. 
ROBERTA Yes I am... legally. 
BRIAN And is it a navy requirement that you dress like it's the 1950's? 
ROBERTA I do not! 
BRIAN (goading her) Who did you vote for in the last election? 
ROBERTA What does that have to do with anything? 
BRIAN Tell me. 
ROBERTA (hesitates, then) I don't know. Charles filled out my absentee ballot. 
BRIAN Oh my God -- it's even worse than I thought! (touching her hair) Is this the same Roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave us new uniforms? 
She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad. 
ROBERTA That Roberta's not around anymore. 
He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe. 
BRIAN I don't believe that. 
They kiss and it heats up quickly. Roberta pulls back. 
ROBERTA I shouldn't. 
BRIAN Because? 
ROBERTA The boys -- 
BRIAN They're sleeping. 
ROBERTA I know, but... I'm still married. 
BRIAN And what's your husband doing right now? 
A few beats, and she moves towards him. 
INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed, a look of afterglow on her face. She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock. 
ROBERTA Oh shit -- the boys. 
BRIAN (O.S.) They're still sleeping. 
She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a suitcase. 
ROBERTA Where are you going? 
BRIAN Texas. 
He dashes out. Roberta sits up, rattled by this news. 
INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around his electric typewriter. 
ROBERTA (O.S.) What's in Texas? 
He turns to see Roberta in the doorway. 
BRIAN Farm workers. I just got the call -- it came through -- my research grant! It came through! Isn't that great? 
ROBERTA Today? 
He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip. In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion. 
BRIAN I've got a few families lined up there, some in California --

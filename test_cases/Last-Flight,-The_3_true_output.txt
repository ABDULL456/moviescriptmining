Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway. 
NIKKI I'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed. 
SHEP Going to bed? Who ever heard of such a thing? 
Bill rises to confer with her at the door. 
BILL Can we help you undress? 
NIKKI No, thank you, William. 
The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange. 
FRANCIS Take off your shoes? 
SHEP Undo your hair? 
BILL Scrub your back or something? 
NIKKI No, I can manage quite well by myself. Good night, everybody. 
The men say, "Good night." Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory eye, is the most polite: 
FRINK Good night, Nikki. 
Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor. The old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar. 
CARY Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop? She wouldn't let them help her undress. 
GENTLEMAN Can't understand it at all. 
CARY You know, she's not very pretty. But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons. 
GENTLEMAN Indeed? 
CARY She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS speaking out of turn. Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture. 
GENTLEMAN Mm, seems to need a few repairs. 
During the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, then notices Francis dozing off. Frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure. 
SHEP She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes. 
BILL You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen! You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head! 
SHEP I did SO see an Assyrian Queen. 
CARY In whose green hat? 
SHEP In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat. 
Francis' pocket watch CHIMES. He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door. Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: "Whoa!" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others. 
CARY Hold on there! Where you goin'? 
SHEP You're not going anywhere. You're on a train. 
FRANCIS Sorry. 
SHEP You go back to your turtles, hear? You've been neglecting your assignment. 
Francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. Curious, the old gentleman rises to join him. Francis explains as he works: 
FRANCIS I have to sprinkle the turtles, see? 
GENTLEMAN Sprinkle the turtles? 
FRANCIS Sure. 
The old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding. 
FRANCIS Cool 'em off. 
GENTLEMAN Hm? 
FRANCIS Turtles get feverish on trains. 
GENTLEMAN Ahh! Uh huh. 
A woman's SCREAM drifts in from the corridor. 
NIKKI'S VOICE Cary! 
FRANCIS What's that?

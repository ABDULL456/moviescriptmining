{"train": "FUNNY PEOPLE \nWritten by \nJudd Apatow \nApril 29, 2008 \nINT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT \nGEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the phone. \nGEORGE (on the phone) Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm coming in. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nShots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club. The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous comedian. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGeorge has sex with a girl in her early twenties. \nINT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT \nGeorge sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone, he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before. \nMUSIC UP:\"WITH A LITTLE LUCK\" - PAUL MCCARTNEY \nBEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE \nINT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY \nGEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is supposed to read. \nEXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING \nGeorge hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous. \nINT. BATHROOM - LATER \nGeorge walks into a fancy, steam-filled shower. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nGeorge drives his large black Mercedes. \nEXT. MEDICAL TOWER - DAY \nGeorge gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT Hey George, can I get a picture with you? \nGEORGE Sure buddy. Let's do it. One of the college students put his arm around George while the other takes the picture. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT #2 Can I get one? \nGEORGE Yeah bud. They take the picture. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT You're the man. We love all your movies, even the last one. \nGEORGE Thanks. Tell your friends. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nGeorge sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath. \nGEORGE I like those lunestas. They really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover I get from the restorils. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (COIN ' D ) \n(BEAT) I try not to take them too often. Just when I know I have to get up early. \nDOCTOR STEVENS George there are some irregularities in your blood work... George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out-- it is now all a jumble of words. \nANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art, a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking, but now we hear nothing. MUSIC UP - \"MY SHIT's FUCKED UP\" BY WARREN ZEVON \nEND CREDIT SEQUENCE \nINT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nIra sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We see an entire pitch session play out. Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't figured out what his stage persona is yet. \nIRA I was thinking about doing something about how I'm not good looking and I'm not bad looking. I'm just good looking enough that if I had a good personality, it could put me over the top. If that was the case. \nLEO Yeah, something about how the uglier you are, the better the personality you need. And the hotter you are, the stupider you can be. \nIRA I had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot, blonde, homeless women. Because someone will always take care of that kind of woman. That woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world. \nLEO Maybe something like... you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world. And you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world. The people who have trouble are the stupid, ugly people. \nIRA That could work. \nLEO Let me keep that one, because I thought of most of it. \nIRA That's not cool. I came up with the concept! What do you got? Let's work on what you have. \nLEO I've got nothing in the notebook. I got drunk last night. But I need material, because I just got spots at the Improv. Budd saw me and approved me. I'm in. \nIRA How could they make you a regular? I got turned down twice. \nLEO Sorry, man. They're only going to let in one chubby, caustic Jew, so I think you're fucked. Their other roommate, MARK, walks in, waves a check at them. \nMARK Hey, dudes. You see this check that I got from my TV show for 25,000 an episode? There was another one of these on the kitchen counter. Did you see it? \nIRA No we didn't see it. Just don't leave those things laying around. \nMARK I wouldn't leave it around if they didn't give me so many. They give it to me every episode. \nLEO Don't throw it in our face that you're on a shitty show. \nMARK I wouldn't, if it was a shitty show and not what Time magazine called \"insightful and delightful.\" \nIRA I thought you were moving out. \nMARK I decided I like it here. Living with you guys keeps me grounded. I don't want to be the guy living in the house on the hill. Even though I could afford it. Hey, I saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs. I invited her in. She's here. \nIRA She's in our apartment? I've never even talked to her. I just gave her quarters at the washing machine. \nMARK You were right, she is pretty mousy and sexy. You gotta talk to her. \nIRA I need time. I have a three-month plan. \nMARK I'll give you ten days for your three-month plan, then I am going to fuck her. You can't just leave that laying around. Starting right now. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMark is talking to DAISY, an alternative-feeling, dark-haired girl in her early twenties. His television show is on the \nTV. \nMARK The thing about working on a sitcom is it's 22 weeks a year, so I can do stand-up the rest of the year. \n(MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) But now people want to see me because they see me on a TV show, so I am kind of a draw. Have you seen the show? \nDAISY I don't own a TV. \nMARK Well I think you can download it to an iPod. Ira walks in. \nMARK (CONT'D) Hey Ira, this is Daisy. \nDAISY how's it going? \nIRA Nice to meet you. I think I gave you quarters once. Ira walks over to the kitchen area, takes out a paper cup. He pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter. Mark looks horrified. \nIRA (CONT'D) (nervously joking) Don't worry, I'll just lick it off the counter. Nobody laughs. Ira starts wiping up the OJ with a rag. \nINT. COMEDY AND MAGIC CLUB - NIGHT \nLeo is on stage, performing his act, doing well. ANGLE ON Ira watching, both amused and jealous. A MAGICIAN and the EMCEE walks over to him. \nEMCEE Schneider didn't show up so, you can do ten minutes after Leo. \nGEORGE It's George. \nIRA Oh my gosh. Hey, how is it going? \nGEORGE I thought you and Leo were pretty funny last night and I have to do this corporate gig for Apple computers in a couple of days and I thought you guys could write me some jokes. \nIRA Definitely. What kind of jokes? Leo passes by in the background. We see Ira decide not to include him in this job offer. \nGEORGE I don't know, about computers and shit. I could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little. \nIRA No problem. Where do you want me to send em? \nGEORGE What is your email? I will send you my fax and email and all that. \nIRA It's a...irasexira\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00aegmail.com. \nGEORGE (long silence) I almost just changed my mind. You got to change that. \nIRA Ok. \nGEORGE Today. Seriously. Ok. Later. Ira hangs up and turns to his friends. \nIRA That was George Simmons. He wants me to write jokes for him. \nLEO Holy shit. That is awesome. You are so lucky. \nMARK Are you gonna get to meet him? \nIRA I don't know, but he is gonna send me his email address. \nLEO We are gonna have his email address? I have to send him the link to my short. \nIRA Easy. Let me get in there a little more. \nCUT TO: \nINT. IRA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nIra is writing jokes. The camera follows the letters being typed on the computer screen as he types. \"Always erase your web history. I had a girlfriend hit history and see eleven hundred porn sites that I visited in an hour.\" Jonah sticks his head in. \nLEO I got one, but you have to tell him its mine. The best thing about Leopard is it lets you watch a porno, write a porno, shoot a porno, and order a porno all at the same time. And you guys made that possible. We see QUICK IMAGES of him typing and printing. He is writing an enormous amount of jokes. Way more than George will ever need. Writing, typing, re-writing in pen, then re- typing, etc. Ira hesitates, then hits send. \nINT. IRA'S BEDROOM \nIra is asleep. The clock says noon. The phone rings. He answers it, groggy. \nGEORGE There's some funny shit in here. Not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit. \nIRA Thanks man. I just want to give you a lot of choices. \nGEORGE Too many choices. I don't like reading that much. I need like ten good jokes. I'm a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten. But thanks for doing it. \nIRA Oh, it was fun to try to write in your voice. I spent the whole night pretending I was you. \nGEORGE So you cried yourself to sleep? \n(ALT) So you whacked off three times last night? Don't worry, I'll get you some money. Is five hundred good? \nIRA Yeah! That'll work. \nGEORGE I'm leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig. You want to come check it out, see if your shit works? \nINT. IRA'S APARTMENT \nCLOSE-UP on their curtains, as they wait for George to pull up. \nLEO Can we go outside and meet him? \nIRA No you can't. Because then we look like fans. \nMARK Maybe he's seen my show. \nIRA He doesn't watch your show. You're show is for eight-year-olds. It's a family show, he doesn't watch that shit. \nLEO I'll just go outside and pretend I'-,n washing my car. The Limo pulls up outside. \nLEO (CONT'D) Holy shit. I feel like my little girl is going to the prom. \nGEORGE Well it's easier with you because I don't know you. I don't feel weird around you. I don't want to be treated like a guy who's going to die. \nIRA I don't know, man. I don't think you want to go through this alone. I think you've got to tell people. Your family. Your friends. \nGEORGE Actually, the reason why I only told you is I need you to do me a favor. \nIRA What? Anything, man. \nGEORGE I can't imagine suffering through the final stages of this. So...I was going to ask you if you would be willing...to euthanize me. \nIRA What does that mean? \nGEORGE Kill me. I figured if I found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger, they could get away with it, and I wouldn't have to suffer. I got a gun that is untraceable. And a silencer. And I thought maybe tonight, I would take a bunch of sleeping pills, and when I slept you would put a bullet in my head. \nIRA I can't do that! \nGEORGE I'll give you fifty thousand dollars in cash. You'd be doing me a favor. It would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody. \nIRA Fifty thousand dollars? Can I at least take a little time to think about it? \nGEORGE Holy shit, you would do it. You were literally thinking about doing it! \nIRA You're an asshole. \nGEORGE I'm an asshole, you were about to kill me. For fifty grand! That's not even a lot of money. \nIPA I just got nervous so I was delaying saying no. \nGEORGE You basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer. While you're cooking me eggs. \nIRA That's not cool, man. You told me you're going to die and you want me to euthanize you. I almost had a heart attack. \nGEORGE Well, I actually am sick. And I'm not going to survive. \nIRA Don't do this. My friends do this all the time. They trick me, and then they trick me again. I'm very gullible. Don't do it. \nGEORGE I'm not putting you on, man. Just don't tell anyone. I mean that. I don't want people to know about this. I don't want to feel weird. Ira nods okay. \nIRA Are you religious? Does that give you any comfort? \nGEORGE Do you really think I'm going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you? \nIRA No. \nGEORGE Maybe later, Father Mulcahy. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe three friends - Mark, Ira, Leo - smoke pot and have what they think is a deep conversation. \nMARK That's so sad. \nLEO If it was me, I would tell everyone. Then everyone would kiss my ass. And take care of me. Tell me how much they love me. \n(MORE) \nLEO (CONT`D) Wipe my ass when I had to go to the bathroom. They'd be crying and sad, and that would make me feel really good. \nIRA He doesn't want to be that guy. He picked up two girls at a bar. Then he had sex with his. And then he came out and had sex with mine. \nMARK In front of you? \nIRA No. \nMARK So being terminally ill makes you a cock-blacker? \nIRA No, what I'm saying is...He's so lost right now that he's hiding from the world. And he's trying to distract himself by doing stand-up and having sex with a lot of women. And he doesn't want anyone to know but me. \nMARK Why you? \nIRA Because he doesn't know me. So he doesn't give a shit. \nLEO That's kind of insulting. \nIRA No, I think we had kind of an instant connection. The other roommate, JAY, walks by. \nJAY You fucked him? \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Please don't do that. \nIRA (tears streaming down his \nFACE) I won't do it, I promise, man. Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately come out. \nIRA (CONT'D) That was first and last time. I'm not even crying anymore. \nGEORGE \n(CRYING) You're still crying. \nIRA (tears coming down) I don't think I am. I think I'm not anymore. I'm not sure what you're talking about. \nGEORGE Okay, as long as we got that straight. George takes a napkin and puts it over his face. \nIRA I'm sorry, George. I really don't know what to do, I don't know how to help you. \nGEORGE (his face still in the \nNAPKIN) No, you're right. I really should tell some people. It just sucks, man. It just sucks. And they're going to feel so bad, I don't even want to look at them and tell them. \n(MORE) \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'd rather drop dead. of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls. I have to make those calls? This is a nightmare. This is a total nightmare. \nIRA Do you want me to call them, and tell them what's going on? \nGEORGE Yeah. \nIRA Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna say no. \nINT. IRA'S BEDROOM \nIra is on the phone. There is a paper with a bunch of numbers in front of him. \nIRA (into the phone) Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of George's. He asked me to call you. His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the receiver. \nIRA (CONT'D) Will you guys shut the fuck up? Shut the fuck up! Ira slam the door. \nIRA (CONT'D) (into phone) I'm sorry. I have some news about George. \nTELLING FRIENDS SEQUENCE \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nGeorge sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits with them and listens and laughs along. \nGEORGE So I left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it. \nCOMEDIAN #1 That's very gay. \nCOMEDIAN#2 No, it was a buddy thing. It was very heterosexual. \nGEORGE Admit it, you were masturbating. \nCOMEDIAN#2 Of course I was whacking it. What else am I gonna do, not whack it? \nGEORGE And I kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh. \nCOMEDIAN #2 I think at one point you said, \"Say my hog is the biggest you've ever seen.\" And then there is this long pause. \nCOMEDIAN#3 That's a bad sign. If it was big at all she wouldn't have paused. \nCOMEDIAN #1 Remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands. They all laugh. \nCOMEDIAN #2 Yeah, you used to get all the girls, man. Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and sad. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nGeorge is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE. \nEX-MANAGER And I feel horrible about it, but the truth is, I was having some issues with gambling, and you were doing so well-and so I took a million dollar check you got in from the studio and I used it to clear up some debts. And I did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed. But you never noticed, and I just never got around to paying you back. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nAllen Covert yells at George for abandoning him. \nIRA You have to, you have no choice. You're doing good. And you're almost done, don't worry. \nGEORGE Well what are we going to do when it's over, when we're done tomorrow? Because then I'm not talking to anyone. \nIRA I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere. You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) I don't know, I don't even ski, but you do. Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more quietly. He's gotten good at this. \nIRA (CONT'D) If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks. \nIRA (CONT'D) Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. We can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGeorge is talking to LAURA, a very pretty woman in her late thirties. Laura is showing George a photo of her two daughters. \nGEORGE Thanks for coming down. You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it. \nLAURA I wanted to, I wanted to see you. \nGEORGE I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. \nLAURA You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts George. \nGEORGE I screwed everything up. I could have been married to you now. \nLAURA Don't do this. \nGEORGE We could've had a family . I don't have a family, I'm all alone here. \nLAURA (tearing up) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what's happening to you. \nGEORGE You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I'm sorry. \nLAURA Maybe I over reacted. I didn't have to leave you. \nGEORGE Yes you did. ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee. \nLAURA And the funny thing is...my husband, he is on the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year. \nGEORGE Did you leave him? \nLAURA No. I have kids now. \nGEORGE See, that was my mistake. I should have had some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs. \nLAURA You were the one and only magic relationship in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace. \nGEORGE Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead. \nLAURA There's never been anything like you before or since. I love Chris, but it's not the same. It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special. \nGEORGE I'm so sorry. I really loved you. And I do love you. \nLAURA I love you too George. I wish there was something I could do. \nGEORGE Don't set me up for jokes like that. You're ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug. \nINT. IRA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIra comes home, deep in the evening. He's eating some food. Daisy walks out of Mark's bedroom, dressed in Mark's long- sleeve t-shirt. She's clearly just had sex. \nIRA Hey. How's it going? \nDAISY Good. Mark walks out in a bathrobe. \nMARK Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend's again tonight. \nIRA I guess it's been more than ten days. \nMARK It's been 21 days. I gave you an extra 11. \nDAISY What are you guys talking about? \nIRA Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter, I don't give a shit. Leo walks in the front door. \nIRA Come on, are you kidding me? We all want to be you. Most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you. People love your shit. \nGEORGE Well, I made a lot of people laugh. I guess that's something. \nIRA It's a lot. \nGEORGE Yeah. I guess so. They watch some more and we see a really happy, young George getting big laughs with something really silly. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Look at that crazy motherfucker. \nGeorge and Ira start watching the act and laughing along, like any audience member. \nINT. JAM ROOM - DAY \nGeorge is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New York Dolls/Clash/Warren Zevon/Paul McCartney) song. This music plays over the following montage. \nMONTAGE \nEXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY \nGeorge walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives before. He likes it. \nINT. IMPROV - NIGHT \nGeorge performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd erupts. She runs back to her seat. George continues with his act. \nEXT.

George wakes up, calls Ira back to keep talking to him. \nEXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT \nGeorge is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace. \nINT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nLisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to them and playing with her two-year-old boy. \nEXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE \nGeorge is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently told them about his situation, and although there is sadness in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in a long time. George says something that makes his DAD laugh. \nINT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM \nIra is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up, but Ira keeps snoring. George sits down next to the sleeping Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream. \nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY \nGeorge and Ira play basketball. Ira is awful. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nIra is making breakfast. George is all dressed for the day. \nIRA What are you doing? \nGEORGE I'm feeling good, so I'm going to the doctor. \nIRA You're not feeling good? \nGEORGE No, I'm feeling good. It's kind of weirding me out. \n(MORE) \nIRA One good thing happens to me in my entire life, and you have to try and take it away and ruin it. \nMOM I don't even know where you came from. \nBOB Don't bother showing up for Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is just for families. \nINT. IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nIra is on his computer. Leo and Mark are watching. \nIRA (typing as he talks) Hey George, we're doing an Orphan's Thanksgiving tomorrow night, want to come? It's just for us losers who don't have any family to eat with. \nLEO He's not gonna email back. \nMARK He's never gonna want to eat Thanksgiving with us. The computer BINGS. The guys scream in delight. \nIRA (reading email) Sure. What time? Do you need me to bring anything? (types back) 3 O'clock at my apartment. Bring wine that we can't afford. The computer bings. \nIRA (CONT'D) (reading email) That's pretty much all wine on earth. See you then. \nMARK \n(EXCITED) Email back and say: (trying to make a joke) If you can, bring that hot chick from your last movie. We definitely have room for her. \n(ALT) Well, then maybe just bring grain alcohol then. They all start laughing. The computer BINGS again. \nIRA (reading it) Hey Faggots, I know what you're doing. Stop emailing me. It's not amusing anymore. They all start high--fiving. \nLEO He called us faggots! \nINT. IRA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMark and Leo are doing the cooking. There a few other comedians (male and female) floating around the apartment. Ira watches the parade on TV. Daisy walks up, site down next to Ira. \nDAISY What have you been up to? I haven't seen you at the Improv. \nIRA I've just been busy. Will you excuse me? Ira gets up, walks out of the room. \nEXT./INT. APARTMENT - DAY \nGeorge walks up, rings the bell. Inside the apartment he hears a bit of a scuffle, as if the friends are fighting over who can open the door. Leo opens the door, sweaty, with a welt on his face. \nLEO Hey, George. How are you? Come on in. Then Mark appears from the side, also sweaty, with a welt on his neck. \nMARK Happy Thanksgiving? Come on in. \nINT. IRA'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - LATER \nEveryone is seated around the table. It's very awkward due to George's presence. It seems to suck the air out of the room. \nLEO We're really glad you could come have Thanksgiving with us. It's a big thrill. \nGEORGE It's weird, I feel like the old guy in the room. When I started out I was always the young guy. It's strange how fast you become the old guy. And I feel exactly the same. \nMARK Well, you don't know us, but you're with friends and admirers. \nGEORGE I know you, I've watched your show. \"'Nuff Said.\" It's a good show. \nIRA You don't have to lie to him. He knows it's not good. \nGEORGE No, it's good, it's cute. I like it. \nMARK \n(BASHFUL) I know it's not that funny, but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again. \nGEORGE Don't be ashamed, it's good. But what about that girl on the show? How old is she? Tell me she's 25. \nMARK No, she's 15. \nGEORGE Holy shit! I feel bad. I don't want to tell you what I did watching that show. Are you serious? She's 15? \nMARK No, she's actually 20. \nGEORGE Okay, good. Now I don't feel so bad. Their weird friend, FUTORAN, pipes up. \nFUTORAN I heard you were sick and now you're better. Is that like, really... what's that like? \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nLeo pulls Ira into the other room and goes off on him. \nLEO He asked for me to write jokes too and you didn't tell me! \nIRA Uh...yes. \nLEO You .fucker! \nIRA I didn't think you would want to. \nLEO Why wouldn't I want to? What, I don't like money? I don't like private jets? \nIRA I'm sorry, it's just, I needed the gig. And you are doing so much better than me. I guess I just wanted this for myself. \nLEO It wasn't yours to keep for yourself. You lied to me. \nIRA I did. And it was fucked up. And I am sorry. I don't know what to say. \nLEO Don't say anything. Just get your shit, and get out of the apartment. \nIRA Are you serious? \nLEO You don't get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode. That is a terrible strategy. \n(MORE) \nLEO (CONT'D) I don't know what the fuck has happened to you--but my name is on the lease, and I don't want to live with it. \nINT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nIra is mad at George for bringing up the jokes. \nIRA I never told Leo because I wanted the gig? \nGEORGE I didn't know you were fucking over your friend. Don't yell at me. \nIRA Well I fucking live with you now because he told me to leave. \nGEORGE He kicked you out for that. \nIRA He said friends don't lie and I'm fucking with his career. \nGEORGE Well in a way that's a compliment to me because he's so mad he can't hang out with me that's he mad at you. That's kind of cool. I got you kicked out. \nIRA Fuck off. \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIra is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his apartment when he was kicked out. George pops his head in. \nGEORGE This should be comfortable in here. This room is almost as big as your old apartment. \nIRA (through gritted teeth) Thank you for letting me stay here. \nGEORGE No problem. Hey, you want to come talk to me while I crash? \nIRA No. You want to come talk to me while I crash? \nCUT TO: \nINT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGeorge is under the covers. He turns on the TV and he changes channels until he finds \"Charlie Rose.\" They're interviewing a reporter from the New York Times about America's policy towards Pakistan. \nGEORGE All right, Charlie. Talk to me. George closes his eyes. \nINT. MANAGEMENT COMPANY - DAY \nGeorge stands in the reception area. \nRECEPTIONIST Terry's ready for you. \nINT. TERRY DOWD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nGEORGE I was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script \"Making Amends.\" \nGEORGE So it's just a list of all the Jewish people? I thought we didn't liked to be tracked and monitored like that. She looks at him, doesn't get the joke. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You know, because of the... holocaust. \nRACHEL (not understanding) It's just a great way for like- minded people to meet. \nGEORGE What if you don't like Jews? She just stares at him. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) I'm joking. (a beat) So, uh, I hear you raise uh money for an environmental group. That must be very satisfying. \nRACHEL It is, because, fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so they're forced to observe the environmental statutes that are already on the books. We also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act. You know, one dilapidated factory in China can produce more pollution than every car in America puts out in one year. \nGEORGE See? That's why I still drive a big truck. I stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down. \nRACHEL (not smiling) I know you're joking, but it's a very serious situation. People like you do a lot of damage to the environment. Whether it's taking a private jet by yourself, or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas-guzzling houses. Your carbon footprint is huge. \nGEORGE You know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint? Big dick. \nINT. IRA'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nGeorge comes in and wakes Ira up. \nGEORGE Come on. We're gonna go do a gig tonight. Up north. And you're gonna open up for me. \nIRA How big a theater? \nGEORGE I think two thousand. \nIRA You should have told me so I could have prepared. I've never played a place that big. How long do you want me to do? \nGEORGE Twenty minutes. Thirty, if you can get there. \nIRA Shit. \nGEORGE Dress nice. Tickets are expensive. \nIRA I don't own anything nice. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nTHE Ira is driving George's Mercedes. George sits in player. backseat watching \"Cloverfield\" on a built-in DVD We see images of different parts of California. \nIRA How fucking up north is this? \nGEORGE Its near San Francisco. \nIRA So we have like five more hours to drive? \nGEORGE It's not that far. It's like two more movies. \nIRA I don't like how you made me your limo driver. It's weird you're in the back and I'm up here. \nGEORGE I'd sit up front but the DVD player is back here. \nIRA I can't even listen to the radio because you're watching the movie. Can I sit back there and you drive? \nGEORGE No. I'm near-sighted. I'll miss the exit. We Lear an EXPLOSION from the movie. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Holy shit! \nIRA What happened? \nGEORGE The monster showed himself. \nIRA \n(SARCASTIC) Great. \nEXT. THEATER - DUSK \nThe car pulls up to the theater. \nINT. THEATER - MOMENTS LATER \nOne of the MANAGERS walks George and Ira through the back of the theater toward the dressing room. They walk across the stage and we see the empty 2,000 seat theater. Ira is freaked out. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM \nLAURA It was, for awhile. Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance. \nIRA I don't know if you've heard, but it looks like George's medicine is working. \nLAURA What do you mean? \nIPA When George got sick they didn't think they had any medicine that would help, so they put him on experimental medicine. And the last time he went to the doctor they couldn't detect his blood disease. They think it might be gone. A moment as Laura takes this in. \nLAURA Why didn't George tell me? \nIRA He just found out. He doesn't want to jinx it. He doesn't want people to get excited, and then have it come back again. The lights go down. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the man you came to see. George Simmons. The place EXPLODES. \nIRA \n(JOKING) I thought everyone came to see me. George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of events. The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious, and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you could trust and spend your life with. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW \nLaura is talking to George and Ira. \nLAURA I really don't know what to say. It's not like you weren't good before, but your act is so much more sophisticated, but just as funny. I've never seen you speak so honestly on stage before. You used to say these goofy jokes. It was really something, you know, and you should be really proud of yourself. \nGEORGE Thanks. A lot has happened. And at least I got some good jokes out of it. \nLAURA Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm really glad I came. \nGEORGE Ira and I are driving out of town tomorrow, I thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out. I want to see what the ranch looks like, and meet your husband. \nLAURA My husband is actually in China for another week, or so. He spends a lot of time there helping American businesses break into that market. So you won't meet him this time, but it would be great if you came by. That would be fun. I'll give you the tour. \nGEORGE Okay. We'll come by in the morning. \nLAURA Okay. An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Bye. I'll see you then. She looks at Ira. As she exits-- \nLAURA (CONT'D) You were good too. \nIRA Why do we have to stop by there tomorrow? The drive is long enough as it is. George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars. \nGEORGE Here's your money for tonight. Good job. \nIRA I'm excited to see her ranch. I hear it's delightful. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nIra and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds. They each lay on their bed in the dark. \nIRA Why couldn't we have gotten two different rooms? \nGEORGE What's the fun in that? You can go pay for your own room, I don't care. \nIRA So, what happened with you and Laura? You seem to get along so well. Why did you cheat on her? \nGEORGE I was young, stupid... and I liked fucking girls. Why do you think I cheated? You would do it too if anyone would fuck you. \nIRA How many times did you cheat on her? \nGEORGE Two or three times ...a week ...for a couple of years. \nIRA Jesus. \nGEORGE It was awful. There was even marriage talk. My parents didn't want me to do it because she wasn't Jewish. She was taking classes to convert, even. I mean, how cool is that? She was changing religions to be with me. She knew more about being a Jew than I did from those classes. She was so cute when she spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong. George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) And then one day, somebody told her, I don't know who. And that was that. \nIRA Why do you want to go see her tomorrow? We could do something productive like get some writing done. \nGEORGE I like her. I love her. I miss her. I just want to spend a little time with her. I know nothing will come of it. I just miss being around her. A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult movies. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Anything looking good to you? \nIRA I don't want to watch adult movies with you. \nGEORGE okay. You want to watch Juno? \nGeorge, Ira, Laura, and Mable are sitting on the floor. Ingrid stands on a make-shift stage singing a Miley Cyrus song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red wig. \nINGRID \n(SINGS) You've got the best of both worlds. Rock it out take it slow. And then you rock out the show! Everyone applauds for her. \nLAURA Okay. Now it's time to see what the judges say. I thought you had a lot of energy, you're clearly gonna make it to the final four, and I love your outfit. What do you think, Randy? \nIRA Yo, dawg. That was the bomb. It was a little pitchy in places, but I dug it. I really dug it. \nMABLE .I'm Simon, and I thought it was horrible. I don't how you made it this far in the competition. \n(MORE) \nMABLE (CONT'D) I think Paula is drunk. You will never be American Idol. \nLAURA Mable, stop it. Stop being mean to your sister. Say something nice. \nMABLE \n(ANNOYED) You were good. \nLAURA Okay, you're not Simon anymore. (to George) Simon, what did you think? \nGEORGE I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with Paula. I think you're the one to beat. They all applaud. Ira notices Laura looking at George with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship. \nLAURA Okay Mable, you're up. Mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten-year-old and singing the Fergie song \"London Bridge.\" \nMABLE \n(SINGING) I want to go down like London, London. \nLAURA I told you not to do that. Simon, what do you think? \nINGRID She was horrible! She's a terrible singer! She's inappropriate! \nLAURA Okay, who's next? Randy? \nIRA I don't know, Dawg. It was a bad song choice. I'm not feeling it. \nGEORGE My turn. Get ready to be blown away. \nGeorge gets up on stage. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) \n(SINGING) Take me down to the paradise city. Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. Oh, won't you please take me home. \n(FASTER) Just an urchin livin' under the street, I'm a hard case that's tough to beat. I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat. I'll pay you at another time! Take it to the end of the line! \nMABLE Boo! \nINGRID Boo! \nGEORGE What? It's Paradise City, by Guns and Roses. \nINGRID You sound like a girl! \nMABLE Vote him off! \nEXT. RANCH - DAY \nLaura sits on a ATV. George sits behind her. Ira is on another ATV with Ingrid sitting in front of him, as he steers. Mable rides a very small dirt bike. \nLAURA All right! Here we go. They start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch. George has his hands around Laura's waist as they drive. Ira looks over, concerned. \nINT. BARN - DAY \nLaura shows them their horses, chickens, goats and ducks. \nEXT. RANCH - DAY \nLaura points out a small pond and a fenced-in riding area. Laura slows down and allows Ira, Mable and Ingrid to get ahead and turn a corner. Then she stops the ATV and turns around and kisses George. George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him, trying to decide what she makes of him now. Then we hear \nO.S. \nMABLE (O.S.) Mom! Mom! Laura hits the gas and they continue the tour. \nCLARKE This guy's funny. You should be opening up for this guy. Hey, who wants a drink? \nEXT. RANCH - NIGHT \nEveryone is taking a walk around the ranch. It is very pretty outside. \nCLARKE I'm going to retire in seven years. I'm done. I'm playing golf for the next fifty years. Work hard now, then get out. That's my plan. I'm putting in the time. Then I'm getting the fuck out. I don't like working. I will do it. I like what it gets me. But I don't like it. \nGEORGE You ever see Laura act? She was quite an actress in her day. \nLAURA George, stop. \nCLARKE That's what I hear. Can't say I watched that much 'Melrose Place' back in the day. She keeps telling me to watch the videos but, you know, I was never a big 'Party of Five' fan. \nLAURA Well, I also ran a theatre company. And it was down to me and Cameron Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed a lot for our family. \nCLARKE Okay, if you say so. (a beat) The Mask was a funny fucking movie. You know what other movie Cameron Diaz was great in? 'There's Something About Mary.' Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and disrespect. They keep walking. \nCLARKE (CONT'D) I love walking it off after a big meal. \nGEORGE It's beautiful here at night. \nLAURA There's no pollution here like in LA so you can actually see the stars. \nIRA They are beautiful, but we have to get going. We have a really long drive to get back to Los Angeles. \nCLARKE You can't leave now, you won't get back until daylight. You should crash in the guest house. I'm sure it not as fancy pants as where you live, George, but it's better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel. \n(MORE) \nCLARKE (CONT'D) And if you want to hang out tomorrow I just installed six flatscreens, we can watch all the football games we want. And dog- racing from Florida. There's a big game tomorrow. Ira, you must have played some ball in your day. \nIRA No, I'm just big-boned. \nGEORGE We probably should get some rest before the drive. All right, show us to our quarters, sir. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nGeorge sleeps on the bed. Ira sleeps on a couch across the room. The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe. She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers, removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking, she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked and goes along happily with it. ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nCLARKE You sure you can't stay? \nIRA We really do need to get back. I have to visit my mom. I can't miss it. It's her birthday. Everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it. She's turning 65. It's very important we get back for it. \nLAURA That's too bad, I wish you could stay. \nCLARKE (very serious) I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, but I can't say that. His eyes start to mist up. \nLAURA Clarke, don't. You don't need to do that. \nCLARKE You know what? I think I do need to do that. One thing I learned in China from some Buddhist friends of mine is it's important to have an open heart, to live in the moment, and to speak the truth to each other. So I'd like to say to you, George, that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wife's life. I really like you. And wish we had more time to get to know each other. And I wish you a peaceful end to your journey. And another great journey on the other side of it. Clarke hugs George. \nGEORGE I really don't know what to say. I re- ally don't know what to say. \nLAURA That was beautiful, honey. Well let me walk them to the car. Ingrid walks over. \nINGRID Don't be sad. Ira told us that his medicine is working and he's not sick anymore. \nMABLE I think that was a secret. I don't think you were supposed to say that. \nCLARKE Mable, take Ingrid into the house. \nMABLE Can we watch another SpongeBob movie? Atlantis.Squarepantis? \nCLARKE Yes. Go into the house and watch a movie now! Mable and Ingrid walk back to the house. \nCLARKE (CONT'D) What the fuck is going on around here? (to Laura) Is that true? \nLAURA I never said that he was still sick. He just took some medicine and it's looking better. You can't detect it in his blood, but it could come back. \nCLARKE Is it looking better? Or is he better? (to Ira) Is he sick anymore? \nIRA Well ...I don't how you define these things-I'm not... sure. \nCLARKE is something going on here? Are you getting your revenge on me while I'm away? I came clean with you, you can't come clean with me. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Not so loud, your kids are sleeping. \nLAURA A tank could roll through this place, it wouldn't wake them up. They kiss some more. She moans louder. \nINT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST ROOM \nIra calls Daisy on the phone, in a panic about what is happening. \nDAISY (V.0.) Hello? \nIRA (on phone) Hey, Daisy. It's Ira. \nDAISY (V.0.) Oh. Ira. What's going on? \nIRA I just wanted to talk to you because I'm in the middle of a terrible situation and I don't have anyone I can talk about it with. My friends are all mad at me and George is kind of losing his mind. \nDAISY (V.0.) You can tell me, what is it? \nIRA Look, I know you think I have the moral code of some guy from the 50s like Dwight Eisenhower, but I'm with George and he's hitting on his ex-girlfriend who's married now and has kids and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of freaking out. I think I'm having a panic attack. \nDAISY (V.0.) Well don't have a panic attack, that's not going to help anything. \nIRA Well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it. \nDAISY (V.0.) (screaming at the top of her lungs) \nDON'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK!!! \nIRA Haha, very funny. \nDAISY (V.0.) Seriously, what's going on? \nIRA Well I guess they dated like ten years ago... \nIra and Daisy begin to have a bonding conversation. \nMUSIC UP - MUSIC THAT MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A NEW DAY, THE \nBEGINNING OF A NEW ERA. \nINT.

I mean, this is fun, but I don't know how much I can take. Hopefully they'll take a nap at some point. I want to take a nap. \nIRA They don't look that tired. The kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them. \nINT. RESTAURTANT - DAY \nGeorge, Laura, Ira, and the kids are seated at a table. The kids are coloring with crayons. \nLAURA I'll be back in an hour and a half, tops.

LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nIra is on the floor with the kids. He watches the headlights of Laura's car disappear down the driveway. George walks back into the room. \nGEORGE Okay, I'm going to go into the other room and watch some TV. \nIRA You don't want to hang with the kids? \nGEORGE Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games at once. I've never done that. \nIRA okay, but I've got to run out and grab some cigarettes. \nGEORGE But you don't smoke. \nIRA I never smoked in front of you because you were sick. But I do. \nINT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT \nIra drives in a panic. \nIRA Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the fucking airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic. He can't make it work. \nINT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nGeorge is watching the kids. He is not good with them, so it is very weird. \nINGRID (O.S.) George! Help! George jumps up and runs to her. She is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet. \nINGRID (CONT'D) Can you wipe my butt? \nGEORGE Don't you know how to do it? \nINGRID I don't do it good. \nGEORGE \n(RELUCTANTLY) Okay. \nINT./EXT.

LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nGeorge calls Ira, gets voice mail. \nGEORGE Where are you, where are you? You have to come back here. I need your help. I don't know how to do this. He walks back to where the kids are. They are watching tv. All around the room are family pictures. He is beginning to feel bad about what is happening. \nINT./EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nLaura gets to check-in, looks around. She does not see Clarke. \nINT. LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nGeorge is sitting at the kitchen table. Mable walks over. \nMABLE I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce. I don't want my parents to get divorced. All my friends' parents are divorced, and they're not happy. \nGEORGE Why would you say that? \nMABLE I heard my mom talking to her friend. I listened through the wall. She was looking for a lawyer. He cheated on her. What does cheating mean? That he's going to marry someone else? Why don't they just try harder? \nINT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nLaura looks for Clarke at the news stand. \nIRA No, no, no!

Be at the next driveway over! To the north! \nEXT./INT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nClarke arrives at the house.

LAURA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nGeorge and Clarke walk outside. Clarke puts up his fists, ready to fight. \nGEORGE She's not happy. Clarke punches George in the face then kicks him martial arts style. \nCLARKE No one who's married is fucking happy. Leave us alone! You fucked up. You fucked it up with her a long time ago. Let it go or I will kill you. I will literally kill you till you're fucking dead. That disease didn't kill you. But I will kill you. \nGEORGE You shouldn't joke about my disease. That was very serious. Very scary. Clarke punches him several times, but they are more like martial arts hits. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) What the hell is that? Ira arrives. George starts yelling at Ira. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Don't jump in. Whatever you do, don't jump in. I don't want your help! \nIRA Okay. \nGEORGE You said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her. What kind of friend are you? \nIRA I am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy. You are out of control. \nGEORGE I didn't deserve what you did to me. You betrayed me ! \nIRA When I got there, she was already kissing him. I never even had a chance to stop it. I didn't get to do anything! \nCLARKE Don't pretend you're fucking mad at each other, just to distract me so I won't beat your ass. Clarke pushes George. \nCLARKE (CONT'D) You're gonna come to my house? You're gonna come to my fucking house? You have to get your own life. Leave us the fuck alone. \nGEORGE Don't hit me! I've been sick! They don't know. The medicine is working now, but I'm still sick. Clarke punches George. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) (to Ira) What are you doing? I said to jump in! \nIRA You told me not to jump in. \nGEORGE That's what \"don't jump in\" means. It means \"jump in.\" Help me! Ira steps in. Clarke hits him hard, then kicks him. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) You're a terrible fighter. \nIRA I know, that's why I became a comedian, because everyone used to beat me up! George runs at Clarke who cracks him in the head hard, sending him to the floor. Then Ira takes a run at him and Clarke kicks Ira in the face twice, with both feet. Laura runs into the middle of the scene. \nGEORGE Laura, tell Clarke to stop! \nLAURA Clarke, please don't do this. \nCLARKE Don't tell me what I can and can not do. \nGEORGE Laura, tell him. Tell him you want to be with me now. Laura doesn't answer. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) Laura? \nIRA You made me the tacky? I'm not a lacky, it's a job. \nGEORGE It's not a job, you're a tacky. You're not even that fucking funny. This gets Ira very mad. \nIRA Who cares? If being funny means being like you, I rather be a little less funny. \nGEORGE Mission accomplished. \nIRA You're the only person I know who learned nothing from a near-death experience! You actually went backwards. All it did was it brought out what a prick you are, brought everything bad to the surface. I liked you better when I was sure you were gonna die. \nGEORGE I'm not going anywhere! \nIRA Everything is about you. You don't even know where I live. You've never asked me one question about my life. How much can one person talk about himself ? You never ask me shit about anything! \nGEORGE Who are you to fucking judge anyone? You're not my friend, you just want my money. You just want to get your foot in the door. \nIRA Fuck your money. Fuck you. This has all been a huge mistake. \nGEORGE Wake me when we get home.

I'm not going to ever talk to you again. So I don't want your car. \nGEORGE So that's how it's going to be. \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE \nGeorge enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile has a big post-it note that says: \"READ THESE!\" \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE \nGeorge lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's really bright in his room. George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The room goes dark. Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban. \"How to Clean Up Clutter.\" \nANCHORWOMAN (ON TV) You know, when you've got a big family, and you've got a lot of clutter... \nINT. GUYS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nIra is talking to Leo. \nLEO We rented out your room to Jay.

Mandy is doing some weird sort of sexy dance for George. \nMANDY This house is so big. It's bigger than the college I went to. \nGEORGE Oh there's a whole other wing that you wouldn't even know existed unless you went through this door. \nMANDY I want to see, I want to see. George and Mandy disappear. Ira and Dawn are left alone. \nIRA You are very pretty. \nDAWN I have a boyfriend. Nothing is going to happen. \nIRA I didn't say anything was going to happen.

George enters. \nGEORGE Hey, Mandy thought you left, so she left. \nDAWN Really? \nGEORGE Sorry, that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house. \nDAWN Oh, well then I guess I better get going? \nGEORGE You don't have to go. I'm just saying that she left. I think she left her purse in the other wing. Come with me, let's go get it. Ira watches this, astonished. \nGEORGE (CONT' D ) Did Ira tell you I have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games? \nDAWN That sounds awesome. \nGEORGE Yeah, I got Galaga. Let's go check it out. \nGeorge looks over his shoulder at Ira, as if to say, \"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.\" \nGEORGE (CONT'D) (to Ira) Hey don't go, I'll be back in a second. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nIra is now watching the end of the movie by himself. George sticks his head in. \nGEORGE That girl left. You want to talk to me while I try to go to sleep. Ira doesn't know what to make of this. \nIRA I guess so. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATER \nGeorge is in bed under the covers, comfortably laying on his pillow. Ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the bed. \nIRA Did you have sex with both of those girls? \nGEORGE I'm afraid I did. I'm sorry. It was just so clear that you were not going to get it done. I figured you wouldn't mind. \nIRA That is crazy. That is super crazy. \n", "test1_true": "IRA How can that even happen? I guess I understand the first one, but why would the second one do it? You probably stink of the first girl. \nGEORGE Well, we took a steam shower together. \nIRA What? \nGEORGE she had never seen a steam shower before, I told her she should enjoy it. \nIRA She wouldn't fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend. \nGEORGE She told me that too, but she says I was on her and her boyfriend's list of people she was allowed to screw. You'd be surprised how many women have me on that list. \nIRA I should get going. \nGEORGE Just talk to me before I fall asleep. I'm weird. I don't like being alone. You should crash in one of the rooms. You're too drunk to drive home. I won't try to fuck you, I just fucked two women and I'm kind of done. \nIRA I may have to whack it in your guest room. \nGEORGE Whack away, I don't give a shit. \n(BEAT) Hey, you were funny tonight. I could see how you could get good. \nIRA Thanks. That was fun. It was rare that I get to play to more than twenty-five people. I've never played for a thousand. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) it, s kind of easier, because even if two hundred like me, it sounds like a lot. \nGEORGE I do feel bad for you, because no matter how hard you try, you'll never be as funny as me. \nIRA Why would you say that? \nGEORGE Did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid? \nIRA No. \nGEORGE That's why. My dad always seemed annoyed with me. He'd always crack me on the head. You would not see it coming. I spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But he was an awesome guy. He was the coolest. He just got annoyed with me. Do you like your parents? They can't be that bad, because you're not that funny. \nIRA They're bananas. And always broke. They got divorced ten years ago, but they both act like it just happened last week. They hate each other. They always put me in the middle of it. I always wanted them to say, \"We don't want you to suffer through this, so we're just going to handle it ourselves.\" They never would do it. They would always make me feel their pain all the time. I would never do that for my kids. Because it's like they._`.re kids. And no matter how many times I tell them to leave me out of it, they never do. Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep. \nIRA (CONT'D) I'll let you crash. \nGEORGE No, keep going. It's interesting. Tell me about your day job? \nIRA Alright. So... (knows he's a sleeping pill at this point) I work at a supermarket at the deli counter. I hate it, but the money's actually pretty good. Better than you'd think. But I'd rather do comedy full-time if I could. The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway. \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING \nGeorge walks into the guest room, where Ira is sleeping. \nGEORGE Hey man, you want to make me breakfast? \nIRA okay. \nGEORGE Do you know how to cook anything? \nIRA Eggs. \nGEORGE Okay, let's have some eggs. While Ira is cooking, George takes a lot of pills. \nIRA What are you doing, man? Are those vitamins? \nGEORGE No. Medicine. I'm sick. \nIRA What do you got? \nGEORGE I've got some crazy blood disease. They think I'm going to die in six months to a year. Some weird thing, almost nobody has it. All these are experimental. \nIRA Are you fucking with me? That's not funny, man. \nGEORGE No, I'm telling you the truth. \nIRA I never heard that before. That would be a big deal. \nGEORGE I haven't told anybody yet. I don't think I'm going to. \nIRA You're not going to tell anybody? You told me. \n", "test2_input": "INT. COMEDY CLUB \nGeorge and Ira are doing sets again. \nINT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGeorge is making a phoney phone call on a speaker phone. Ira listens. \nGEORGE (Grandmother voice) I ordered your Roast Beef. And normally it's delicious. But this time I paid a price! \nDELI MANAGER I'm very sorry ma'am. What if you come in and I give you a free sandwich? \nGEORGE (Grandmother voice) Well that's very nice of you. But I have one question for you. Can I get two sandwiches? George motions for Ira to do something. \nIRA Grandma! Get off the fucking phone. Don't run up my fucking bill. \nIra starts slapping his hands together. George screams in pain. \nDELI MANAGER Ma'am! Are you okay? \nGEORGE (Grandmother voice) This is a family matter! He can hit me if he wants. He's my grandson, and I love him! Now may I give you my name, so you have it on file so I can get my free sandwich? K-A-C-A-H-A-K-R-E-K-K-U- C-T-A-R-S-U-T-A-R-G-M-S. Did you get that? Can you say it back to me? \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nIra enters. \nIRA George? George? He walks through the house, finds George in bed. For the first time he seems sick. \nIRA (CONT'D) Are you all right? \nGEORGE No, I had a bad night last night. I was sweating though the sheets, couldn't stop. So I got up, watched half of a season of The Wire and then I slept till...what time is it now? \nIRA It's three in the afternoon. \nGEORGE I wanted to get up and do something. But I don't think I have it in me. I may just go back to bed. \nIRA Well do you need anything? \nGEORGE Yeah, I need all sorts of things. But nothing you can get me. You should go up anyway. You were in a groove the other night, you don't want to get rusty. \nIRA I. .I. .can't anyway. I'm doing the late shift at the deli counter. \nGEORGE Really? How long you gonna keep that job for? I'm paying you good money. What if someone you perform in front of goes into Ralph's and sees you cutting turkey? \nIRA I know, I just want to be safe, make sure I can pay my bills. I don't like to be nervous about that shit. \nGEORGE I wasn't like you. I had a different theory. You've got to spend money to make money. Nothing makes you work harder than being in debt. Maybe we should go buy a Corvette. That'll make you try to be funnier. \nINT. RALPH'S SUPERMARKET \nCHUCK so how much notice are you giving me? \nIRA Notice? I'm not giving you any notice. I'm just quitting. \nCHUCK You're supposed to give notice. That's what people do. \nIRA Why would I give you notice? I'm not trying to stay in Ralph's good graces. I'm not trying to preserve my good standing at Ralph's. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) I'm just quitting. You don't quit and then keep working for two weeks. \nCHUCK Well I don't have enough people to cover all your shifts, now I gotta cover them. \nIRA I wish I could help you, but I'll kill myself if I keep working here. It's not what I want to do. Maybe Gail can cover my shifts. \nCHUCK Gail can't work weekends, and my kid's birthday is this weekend. What am I supposed to do? \nIRA I don't know. Get someone to cover from a different Ralph's. There are thousands of them in Southern California. No one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl? I'm not the linchpin that keeps Ralph's from falling into chaos. \nCHUCK You're an asshole. You always thought you were slumming it here. Go tell your tucking fart jokes., Get the fuck out of here before I kick the shit out of you. \nIRA You know what? I'm glad you said that, because I was about to tell you I could work this weekend. What's your problem? I didn't say anything bad about you, I just said I didn't want to work for Ralph's anymore. Chuck takes a step to Ira like he's going to hit him. Ira steps back a few feet. \nIRA (CONT'D) I'll tell Dave. I'll tell Dave. I tried to do this politely. The thanks I get. \nIra walks out the store. As he walks out, he turns to a lady (in her 40s) at the register. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY \nIra sees Daisy walking out as he's walking into the apartment complex. He takes a deep breath, then: \nIRA Hey, Daisy. \nDAISY Hey -- \nIRA Ira. \nDAISY (she doesn't) I know. \nIRA I was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see Wilco at the Greek Theatre. You want to come? Are you into them at all? \nDAISY I would love to come. That would be amazing. \nIRA Okay. I'll call you with the details. Hopefully I'll be able to get seats which will not require high-powered binoculars. \nDAISY I don't care where the seats are. I just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts, \nIRA Perfect. Then I can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats. (laughing uncomfortably) That won't work. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) That wasn't funny at all. I'm gonna leave while I'm ahead right now. She smiles. He walks away. \nINT. GEORGE'S HOUSE \nIra walks into George's house. \nIRA George? Ira walks into George's bedroom. He hears something, pokes his head in. In the dark, he can barely see George making phoney calls by himself. Ira listens for awhile, not sure what to make of this. George doesn't see him. \nGEORGE (speaking like an old \nWOMAN) I was robbed! One second you're walking down the street with your Visa card, having a grand old time, and then you've got a fucking gun in your mouth! \nVISA LADY What's the number of the card, Ma'am? \nGEORGE I don't know! The thief has the card, why don't you ask the thief the number of the card! George hangs up the phone. He starts dialing. \nGEORGE (CONT'D) (as a Texan) Ah yes, I came into your comedy club tonight and I was very offended by the performer. I did not pay good money to have the so- called \"comedian\" shake my wife's hand, then smell it and say, \"Did you have fish for dinner?\" That is not my idea of entertainment. Ira leaves the room, feeling like he's intruded on a private moment. \nINT. RED LOBSTER RESTAURANT \nGeorge and Ira are eating. \nIRA I was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation... your condition. \nGEORGE No, no. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 don't want to do that. \nIRA I feel like maybe you're holding everything in and I can understand why you don't want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it. But I bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends. Wouldn't it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order? What do people do at this moment Don't they have to do stuff? \nGEORGE I don't want to do anything. I just want to be in the moment and live every day the best I can. As soon as I confront it with everybody, everything's changed and I can't get back. \nIRA Everything has changed. At some point you're going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you. I'm sure there's a lot of business, estate issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll feel better than if you just deal with everything. Where are your parents? \nGEORGE P4y parents would drop dead if I told them what was happening. They're in their 80s. They don't have to go through this. I'll make sure they find out at the last possible second. \nIRA Friends? \nGEORGE I don't think I do. I thought I did. I got a lot of people I know, shoot the shit with, fuck around with. But I realized when this happened I'm not close to anyone. I had no one to call. My friendships are Hollywood friendships. When I was lying in bed I couldn't think of one person I wanted to share this with. Maybe it's me, maybe I never got close to anybody. \nIRA I think if you talk to people you'd find out a lot of people care about you. You're kind of old already, I mean, compared to me. I'm sure you touched a lot of people's lives. You can't spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room. \nGEORGE The only reason I did that was because I couldn't sleep. And I had no one to call. \nIRA Well maybe that's the problem. Maybe if you told more people you'd have more people to call. You can't just talk to me about it, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You're the first person I've known who's sick. I'm not good at it. (eyes beginning to well \nUP) You've given me diarrhea, I'm nervous about you and I'm in over my head. \nGEORGE (his eyes begin to well \nUP) Don't cry in front of me, man. I can't start that. \nIRA I'm sorry. \nGEORGE Seriously. I can't...I can't have you do that. George really begins to cry. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY \nIra, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses out of Popsicle sticks. \nIRA If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney. \nMABLE \n(SADLY) When is George gonna die? \nINGRID George is gonna die? \nIRA Why would you say that? \nMABLE I heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying. \nINGRID I don't want George to die. \nMABLE What do you care? You just met him. \nIRA George is gonna be fine. \nMABLE They told me my grandfather wouldn't die, but he did. \nIRA Here's the truth. George was really sick. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better. And he's gonna live a long time. The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved. \nMABLE I think my mom's in love with him. Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks. \nEXT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST HOUSE \nGeorge and Laura park in the driveway, then sneak around to a back guest house. \nINT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY \nGeorge and Laura enter the guest house, which has been turned into her husband's office/playroom/sports-viewing room. On the wall are six enormous flatscreen TVs. The room is also filled with sports memorabilia in Lucite cases and expensive looking sports photography. \nGEORGE Does somebody in your family like sports? They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens. \nLAURA I really never thought I was going to see you again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I can't do this. \nGEORGE Then let's not do it. She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is he a good guy or a bad guy? \nLAURA I gotta get back to the kids. \nINT. LAtJRA'S RANCH - ENTRYWAY - DAY Laura and George are walking into the house. They are not holding any bags. They walk into the living room where Ira is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with Mable and Ingrid. \nIRA You're back. That was quick. \nGEORGE The town is beautiful. \nIRA Where are the groceries? \nLAURA We decided ordering in might be a little more fun. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER \nEveryone is sitting on the couch watching Ratatouille on the television. They see car lights in the driveway. \nLAURA Food's here! All right, everybody. Let's sit down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's CLARKS, Laura's husband. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing home? \nCLARKE The man I was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack, if you can believe that. So I decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings. George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting himself into. \nGEORGE Oh. Hello. \nCLARKE Hello. \nLAURA Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man you think is dying. \nCLARKE It is really nice to meet you, George. Laura talks about you all the time, and we're obviously big fans of your movies. \n", "test3_true": "LAURA I'm so glad you're home, honey. Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over. \nIRA What's taking so long with the pizza? Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears in the doorway. \nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty- seven, please. \nINT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING \nEveryone is seated for dinner, including the kids. \nIRA \n(NERVOUSLY) This is really great pizza. Thank you very much. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CCNT'D) It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California. But this really tastes like New York pizza. A long pause. \nGEORGE Sounds like your business is going very well. \nCLARKE People never thought China would do this much business with us, you know, but it didn't seem like a risky proposition for me. They've got a billion people, we make all kinds of cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not. Sooner or later they're gonna find a way to get our shit. \nLAURA He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at something in Chinese. \nCLARKE You don't think they want new mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm trying to get access into North Korea, no shit. That situation could chance overnight. That is a huge market waiting to be tapped. It's already starting in Cuba. \nIRA My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks. He still has it. It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant. \nCLARKE So, George. How are you holding up? \nGEORGE Uh...I'm hanging in there. \nCLARKE How are you feeling? \nLAURA He's doing really well. He's been very strong. \nCLARKE It's a terrible situation. I'm so sorry. \nGEORGE I appreciate that. \nLAURA He's been fighting the good fight. His doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this conversation is happening. \nCLARKE You're a tougher man than me. I don't know how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head. \nGEORGE It just makes you appreciate every moment. It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life. \nLAURA Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring out the desert? \nIRA I'd love desert. What do you have? Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet tooth right now. Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now? I've got a better idea, I make a really good milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen. \nTNT. LIVING ROOM Empty milkshakes litter the coffee table. \nCLARKE Do you know who might be able to help you? A Chinese doctor. Have you explored Eastern medicine at all? \nLAURA Now's not the time to talk about this. \nCLARKE I'm trying to help the man. \nGEORGE No, I haven't. \nCLARKE Hey. I'm the last guy who would buy into that shit, but it works. \nLAURA He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit. \nCLARKE Our country's only two hundred years old. The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out. How I got into it, I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked. \nLAURA \n(NERVOUSLY) I take herbs for my PMS. They really helped. \nMABLE Daddy, you've been cursing a lot. You owe me a dollar for every curse. I think you owe me fifty dollars. \nINGRID This conversation is scaring me. I don't want George to die. \nCLARKE You girls can go play in the other room. The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease. It works. I've seen it. I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You can't kill these people. \nIRA Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit. Clarke laughs. \n"}

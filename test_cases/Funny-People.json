Because then I'm not talking to anyone. \nIRA I was thinking we should go skiing somewhere. You're still physically doing well, and that's not going to last forever. You should do something active. Go to Colorado, or Tahoe, or something. Or do something crazy. Go to Switzerland, or Sweden, or wherever they have mountains. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) I don't know, I don't even ski, but you do. Maybe you should do something like that. Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more quietly. He's gotten good at this. \nIRA (CONT'D) If it's too hard, we can just ski for an hour or two a day, and then get drunk at the bar. You can hit on hot ski instructors, and then I can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors. He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks. \nIRA (CONT'D) Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the mountain air, fun to look at the mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even be here. We can hang out there as long as you want, I got nothing to do. Ira closes the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGeorge is talking to LAURA, a very pretty woman in her late thirties. Laura is showing George a photo of her two daughters. \nGEORGE Thanks for coming down. You didn't have to do that, i appreciate it. \nLAURA I wanted to, I wanted to see you. \nGEORGE I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. \nLAURA You don't have to be sorry, that was like 12 years ago. Everything worked out for the best. We see this hurts George. \nGEORGE I screwed everything up. I could have been married to you now. \nLAURA Don't do this. \nGEORGE We could've had a family . I don't have a family, I'm all alone here. \nLAURA (tearing up) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for what's happening to you. \nGEORGE You know, maybe I deserve it. I screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life. I cheated on you. For no reason at all. Just young and stupid. And selfish. I'm sorry. \nLAURA Maybe I over reacted. I didn't have to leave you. \nGEORGE Yes you did. ANGLE ON: Ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee. \nLAURA And the funny thing is...my husband, he is on the road a lot for business. He did the same thing last year. \nGEORGE Did you leave him? \nLAURA No. I have kids now. \nGEORGE See, that was my mistake. I should have had some kids with you before I cheated. she laughs. \nLAURA You were the one and only magic relationship in. my life. She starts to cry. He does too. They embrace. \nGEORGE Me too. They cry, forehead to forehead. \nLAURA There's never been anything like you before or since. I love Chris, but it's not the same. It's fine, maybe it isn't even fine, but we had something special. \nGEORGE I'm so sorry. I really loved you. And I do love you. \nLAURA I love you too George. I wish there was something I could do. \nGEORGE Don't set me up for jokes like that. You're ruining the moment. She smiles. They hug. \nINT. IRA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIra comes home, deep in the evening. He's eating some food. Daisy walks out of Mark's bedroom, dressed in Mark's long- sleeve t-shirt. She's clearly just had sex. \nIRA Hey. How's it going? \nDAISY Good. Mark walks out in a bathrobe. \nMARK Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were sleeping at your boyfriend's again tonight. \nIRA I guess it's been more than ten days. \nMARK It's been 21 days. I gave you an extra 11. \nDAISY What are you guys talking about? \nIRA Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter, I don't give a shit. Leo walks in the front door. \n", "test1_true": "LEO (CONT' D ) \n(HALF-HEARTEDLY) They said they're gonna start giving me good spots on the weekends. \nIRA I've been getting good weekend spots. \nLEO Well, that's because they think if they book you, George will show up. \nIRA What's with you guys? You both want to fuck my mother too? What more do you want to do to me tonight? Ira walks away. \nLEO I really did kill. (a beat) Did you guys just bone, or something? \n(MORE) \nLEO (CONT'D) I'm getting a little vibe here. It's getting me excited. \nEXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER \nIra and Daisy are having a heated conversation outside. \nIRA So now you're with Mark? You're his girl? \nDAISY I just went out with him one night. \nIRA You got a lot accomplished in one night. How did this happen? \nDAISY He invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off. \nIRA Must have been a great episode. I should get a job on a shitty show so I can use it as foreplay. \nDAISY What are you talking about? Don't treat me like that. \nIRA I am not treating you like anything. Do what you want. I don't give a shit. I'll go to Wilco alone. \nDAISY What planet are you from? The one where everyone is perfect like you, you judgemental fuck? \nIRA How could you do that? I thought we were going out on a date. \nDAISY We are going on a date. I didn't plan it. Am I not allowed to do stuff because we're going out on a .date? What the fuck's the matter with you? \nIRA I bought tickets to Wilco and I worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesn't normally let people like me eat there. I just didn't see this coming. Yes, you're right. You can do anything you want. I'm glad this fucking happened, before I wasted the night with you. I didn't think you were that kind of person. That you would sleep with a guy like that. \nDAISY He's your roommate. You don't like him? \nIRA No, I think he's a pussyhound. \nDAISY Well, I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. I wasn't trying to hurt you. It just happened. \nIRA You got excited because he's the star of the show. You literally star-fucked. \nDAISY Yes, you're right. I'm awful. \n(CRYING) Give me a break. I don't even know you. \nINT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nIra goes into the house. Mark is there. \nMARK I told you I was going to give you 10 days. That was three weeks ago. \nIRA I thought you were joking. \nMARK I didn't know she actually mattered to you. We talk about girls we want to fuck all the time. \nIRA I just bought these two Wilco tickets. Wanna go? \nMARK I would, but I'm going with Tobey Maguire. He wants me to play his younger brother in some movie. \nEXT. SKI SLOPE - DAY \nGeorge and Ira are skiing. There is no music, no noise. It is very peaceful. George stops in a spot where he is surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains. He looks around, taking it all in. \nINT. SKI LODGE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nGeorge and Ira are watching videotapes of George doing stand- up when he was much younger. He's really, really funny. And very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent. \nGEORGE You know, I never got married. I never had kids. I didn't get to do a lot of things I thought I would do. But I was pretty fucking funny, right? \n", "test1_id": 1785, "test2_input": "EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY \nIra, Mable and Ingrid are outside at a table building houses out of Popsicle sticks. \nIRA If you had an Exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney. \nMABLE \n(SADLY) When is George gonna die? \nINGRID George is gonna die? \nIRA Why would you say that? \nMABLE I heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying. \nINGRID I don't want George to die. \nMABLE What do you care? You just met him. \nIRA George is gonna be fine. \nMABLE They told me my grandfather wouldn't die, but he did. \nIRA Here's the truth. George was really sick. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CONT'D) But he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now he's better. And he's gonna live a long time. The kids buy it, and Ira seems relieved. \nMABLE I think my mom's in love with him. Ira looks doubly disturbed. He quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks. \nEXT. LAURA'S RANCH - GUEST HOUSE \nGeorge and Laura park in the driveway, then sneak around to a back guest house. \nINT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY \nGeorge and Laura enter the guest house, which has been turned into her husband's office/playroom/sports-viewing room. On the wall are six enormous flatscreen TVs. The room is also filled with sports memorabilia in Lucite cases and expensive looking sports photography. \nGEORGE Does somebody in your family like sports? They start passionately making out, slamming into the flatscreens. \nLAURA I really never thought I was going to see you again. I grieved for you like you were dead. They continue to kiss. Suddenly she stops. \nLAURA (CONT'D) I can't do this. \nGEORGE Then let's not do it. She stares at him, trying to figure out what he's become-- is he a good guy or a bad guy? \nLAURA I gotta get back to the kids. \nINT. LAtJRA'S RANCH - ENTRYWAY - DAY Laura and George are walking into the house. They are not holding any bags. They walk into the living room where Ira is making a Spongebob SquarePants puzzle on the floor with Mable and Ingrid. \nIRA You're back. That was quick. \nGEORGE The town is beautiful. \nIRA Where are the groceries? \nLAURA We decided ordering in might be a little more fun. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER \nEveryone is sitting on the couch watching Ratatouille on the television. They see car lights in the driveway. \nLAURA Food's here! All right, everybody. Let's sit down at the kitchen table. Everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen. Laura opens the front door, George is a few steps behind her. A handsome man of forty appears. This is not the pizza guy. It's CLARKS, Laura's husband. \nLAURA (CONT'D) Clarke, oh my gosh. What are you doing home? \nCLARKE The man I was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack, if you can believe that. So I decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings. George appears behind Laura, not knowing what he's getting himself into. \nGEORGE Oh. Hello. \nCLARKE Hello. \nLAURA Oh, Clarke. George had a performance last night in town, which I went to, and him and his opening act, Ira, came by to say hello on their way out of town. There is an awkward moment, then Clarke smiles and gives George a compassionate look, the type of look you give a man you think is dying. \nCLARKE It is really nice to meet you, George. Laura talks about you all the time, and we're obviously big fans of your movies. \n", "test2_true": "LAURA I'm so glad you're home, honey. Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over. \nIRA What's taking so long with the pizza? Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears in the doorway. \nPIZZA DELIVERY GUY Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty- seven, please. \nINT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING \nEveryone is seated for dinner, including the kids. \nIRA \n(NERVOUSLY) This is really great pizza. Thank you very much. \n(MORE) \nIRA (CCNT'D) It tastes just like New York pizza, which is so surprising because you can't get good pizza in Los Angeles, so you wouldn't think you could get it in Northern California. But this really tastes like New York pizza. A long pause. \nGEORGE Sounds like your business is going very well. \nCLARKE People never thought China would do this much business with us, you know, but it didn't seem like a risky proposition for me. They've got a billion people, we make all kinds of cool shit in America, they start finding out about it on the internet and what-not. Sooner or later they're gonna find a way to get our shit. \nLAURA He speaks Chinese. For real. Ingrid yells at something in Chinese. \nCLARKE You don't think they want new mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm trying to get access into North Korea, no shit. That situation could chance overnight. That is a huge market waiting to be tapped. It's already starting in Cuba. \nIRA My friend backpacked across China and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate. He was sickforweeks. He still has it. It'sthekind of thing you can't getridof, you have it for the restofyour life, but it stays dormant. \nCLARKE So, George. How are you holding up? \nGEORGE Uh...I'm hanging in there. \nCLARKE How are you feeling? \nLAURA He's doing really well. He's been very strong. \nCLARKE It's a terrible situation. I'm so sorry. \nGEORGE I appreciate that. \nLAURA He's been fighting the good fight. His doctors are taking very good care of him. Ira can believe this conversation is happening. \nCLARKE You're a tougher man than me. I don't know how I could go about my day with that hanging over my head. \nGEORGE It just makes you appreciate every moment. It brings things into focus, you suddenly realize what's important in life. \nLAURA Does anybody want seconds? Or should I bring out the desert? \nIRA I'd love desert. What do you have? Do you have any ice cream or cake, or anything like that? I have a real big sweet tooth right now. Why don't we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now? I've got a better idea, I make a really good milkshake. We should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen. \nTNT. LIVING ROOM Empty milkshakes litter the coffee table. \nCLARKE Do you know who might be able to help you? A Chinese doctor. Have you explored Eastern medicine at all? \nLAURA Now's not the time to talk about this. \nCLARKE I'm trying to help the man. \nGEORGE No, I haven't. \nCLARKE Hey. I'm the last guy who would buy into that shit, but it works. \nLAURA He really is the last guy who would buy into that shit. \nCLARKE Our country's only two hundred years old. The Chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out. How I got into it, I had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a Chinese doctor and he gave me some herbs that tasted like dogshit, but they worked. \nLAURA \n(NERVOUSLY) I take herbs for my PMS. They really helped. \nMABLE Daddy, you've been cursing a lot. You owe me a dollar for every curse. I think you owe me fifty dollars. \nINGRID This conversation is scaring me. I don't want George to die. \nCLARKE You girls can go play in the other room. The Chinese have a completely different way of looking at health. They don't think doctors should attack the diseases in the body, they're all about trying to support the body and make it stronger, so the body can fight off the disease. It works. I've seen it. I wish I could find a way to mass-market Chinese medicine in this country. Someone's gonna do it and make a fuck-load of money. Because these people get old, really old. You can't kill these people. \nIRA Either that or they're all young and they just look like shit. Clarke laughs. \n", "test2_id": 1786, "test3_input": "LAURA I'll be back in an hour and a half, tops. And then it all begins. \nGEORGE Okay, call me if you need any backup. \nLAURA I love you. \nGEORGE (really uncomfortable) I.. . love you. The car drives off. \nINT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nIra is on the floor with the kids. He watches the headlights of Laura's car disappear down the driveway. George walks back into the room. \nGEORGE Okay, I'm going to go into the other room and watch some TV. \nIRA You don't want to hang with the kids? \nGEORGE Nah, I was going to watch four hockey games at once. I've never done that. \nIRA okay, but I've got to run out and grab some cigarettes. \nGEORGE But you don't smoke. \nIRA I never smoked in front of you because you were sick. But I do. \nINT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT \nIra drives in a panic. \nIRA Holy shit, holy shit. Where's the fucking airport around here? Ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic. He can't make it work. \nINT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nGeorge is watching the kids. He is not good with them, so it is very weird. \nINGRID (O.S.) George! Help! George jumps up and runs to her. She is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet. \nINGRID (CONT'D) Can you wipe my butt? \nGEORGE Don't you know how to do it? \nINGRID I don't do it good. \nGEORGE \n(RELUCTANTLY) Okay. \nINT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT \nIra is still messing with the navigation system. He finally gets frustrated and punches it. \nIra yells to someone on the street. \nIRA How do you get to the fucking airport?! \nINT. LAURA'S RANCH - NIGHT \nGeorge calls Ira, gets voice mail. \nGEORGE Where are you, where are you? You have to come back here. I need your help. I don't know how to do this.

Mable walks over. \nMABLE I think my mom and dad are getting a divorce. I don't want my parents to get divorced. All my friends' parents are divorced, and they're not happy. \nGEORGE Why would you say that? \nMABLE I heard my mom talking to her friend. I listened through the wall. She was looking for a lawyer. He cheated on her. What does cheating mean? That he's going to marry someone else? Why don't they just try harder? \nINT.

She looks at him for a moment, then heads over to him with determination. \nEXT./INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nIra parks in the no-standing zone. He gets out and starts walking into the airport.

I don't know this town. \nGEORGE (V.O.) Well come back. I don't know how to take care of these kids, I'm not a camp counselor like you. These kids are on to me. The older one's too intense.

AIRPORT - FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - NIGHT \nLaura is talking to Clarke, emotional. Clarke is crying. \nCLARKS I'm so sorry. This only happened because of me. It's all my fault. I made you feel terrible. I made you feel unsafe in our relationship. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Ira stands there, staring at them. \nLAURA I'm sorry too. I love you so much. It was just a flirtation. It never went anywhere. It's just after you cheated on me, I felt so alone. And you were gone so often that I felt like our life doesn't work. \nCLARKE Then I have to make a change. I'll stop most of the traveling. There's nothing more important than you and the kids. Ira starts to turn to sneak away. Clarke sees him. \nCLARKE (CONT'D) Ira! What's going on? What are you doing here? \nIRA Oh, I'm just headed back to Los Angeles. I've got some spots at the Improv I've got to do this weekend. \nLAURA (under her breath) Oh, fuck. \nCLARKE You're headed back to Los Angeles?

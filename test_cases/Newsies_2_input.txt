DAVID He's just sleeping, Momma -- 
She quickly takes him from Jack. MAYER, 43, is relieved but angry to see his sons -- his right arm is bandaged. MAYER We've been waiting dinner -- where've you been? David says nothing; crosses to the table and dumps the day's receipts on it, looks up at his father proudly. 
MAYER You made all this selling papers...? (CONTINUED)

37   CONTINUED:                                                     37 DAVID Half of it's Jack's -- he's our selling partner. And our friend. This is my parents. Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH, 16, enters from another room with an armload of lace piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly tongue-tied. DAVID That's Sarah.    My sister. She smiles -- Jack still can't find his tongue.       Mayer, seeing his awkwardness, steps in -- 
MAYER Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup. ESTHER (mortified) Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Esther herself as she waters the soup. Jack stands drinking in the family's warmth. 
38   INT. APARTMENT - LATER                                         38 Les mumbles in his sleep on a board stretched between two chairs. Jack, eating heartily, his eloquence regained, holds forth at the dinner table. JACK What I saw today, I gotta say your boys are born Newsies, Mr. Jacobs. With my experience and their hard work -- just a little more, thanks -- (third bowl of soup) -- I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat. 
MAYER That many...? JACK More when the headline's good. 
SARAH What makes a headline good?

38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 JACK Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse' or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love nest' or 'nude' -- Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked. 
JACK (embarrassed) 'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much... 
MAYER (laughing) You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! ESTHER That's for your birthday tomorrow! MAYER I've had enough birthdays!    This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- DAVID It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- MAYER You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised. 
All activity stops, an awkward silence.       Mayer looks at his bandaged hand. MAYER It will heal... they'll give me back my job... I'll make them... Jack sees how worried the family is.       No one seems able to speak, then -- 
LES (in his sleep) 'Gimme all ya got, baby...' 
The family is shocked -- except for Jack and David, who sputter into laughter. The celebration is restored -- Jack digs into an enormous slab of cake, looking around at the smiling faces, for the moment feeling he belongs...

39    EXT. OUTSIDE APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - LATER                 39 Jack and David talk; the family visible inside. 
JACK How'd your pop get hurt? DAVID The factory. An accident. (bitterly) He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him. 
Inside, Esther is singing a lullaby to Les; Mayer calls out to David. 
MAYER David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. DAVID Why don't you stay here tonight...? JACK I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         * (beat)                                          * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 * DAVID See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner. 
JACK (smiles) Carryin' the banner. 
Jack watches as David rejoins the family inside, the warmth, the casual intimacy. He moves off, singing: SONG:   "SANTE FE":   3:06

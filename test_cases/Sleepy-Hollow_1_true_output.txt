ICHABOD Get up those stairs.  Open the door to the roof and wait. 
Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn. 
EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning. 
UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe exposes grindstone, throwing sparks. 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
Katrina looks down from the stairs. 
The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door. 
KATRINA Ichabod... 
ICHABOD Keep climbing.  I will follow... 
Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of the milling platform. 
ICHABOD (under his breath) Hopefully. 
ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the door to the roof. 
BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust. 
He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust. 
EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT 
Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them. 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
Ichabod sees below... the Horseman sticks a hand through, trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long. 
Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with effort, throws... 
The bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door... 
EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The grindstone falls through, SLAMMING the Horseman down... 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system. More and more dust rises. 
Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above. 
YOUNG MASBATH Look out! 
The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder, but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up... 
The Horseman just misses the final rung. 
Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off. 
Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from the milling platform and get there. 
The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain... 
The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging... 
Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps... 
Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely. 
The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands on the milling platform. 
Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs, grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up. 
Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls. 
Ichabod and Young Masbath look... 
The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the milling platform and leaps... 
Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it... 
The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below. 
Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs. 
EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT 
Katrina helps them onto the roof. 
KATRINA Quickly, close it. 
ICHABOD No. (takes lantern, points) Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump. 
YOUNG MASBATH Jump?  Jump where? 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs. 
EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT

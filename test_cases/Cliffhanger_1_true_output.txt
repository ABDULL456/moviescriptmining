OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
Gabe and Maggie still have to cling desperately to the sheer wall -- the airburst has turned the crack into a wind tunnel -- it's as if the mountain were trying to blow them out. 
TOWER FACE 
Hal, shocked, stares at the enormity of the explosion. Qualen looks serenely satisfied. 
QUALEN When I was seventeen, I was a sentry on the East Berlin boundary. There was a problem, then -- too many defectors were managing to sneak through the wilderness to the west. A man would take them through, every night of every week -- a man like your friend. (beat) He had quite a sense of humor. Every time he got someone through, he'd radio us at midnight to let us know how many. "Five tonight." "Eight more have been freed tonight." No one could find the route. It made me look bad. (beat) I looked day and night and finally I found it. A tunnel. I didn't tell me superiors. I put a charge there, with a timer to trigger a radio receiver on the detonator. At midnight. Our friend made his radio report, and I heard him say "seven" before the explosion. (beat) They pulled eight bodies out of the tunnel, and I was promoted to intelligence the next day. 
Hal, stunned, looks at the radio, realizing Qualen tricked him into detonating the bomb. Travers, grinning, takes the radio from Hal and pats him on the back. 
TRAVERS Thanks. We couldn't have killed him without you. 
GABE AND MAGGIE - ON THE WALL 
The force of the airburst, as brief as it is strong, is over. Dust slowly swirls out -- Gabe and Maggie raise their heads. Gabe looks back -- the crack is now sealed off. Gabe takes a piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along with the rope. 
GABE Knock this in the side. Make it firm. 
Maggie does as Gabe takes the binoculars out, and climbs out on a slim toehold so he can look up the wall. 
GABE'S POV - UP THE WALL 
Gabe whips the binoculars up to the top edge of the wall. It's blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third bomb, visible on the mountain's edge. The LED counts down, but it's partly obscured. All Gabe can see is the seconds, not the minutes, that remain -- :42 -- :41 -- 
GABE (O.S.) Bad news. There's another bomb up there. We've got to move quick. 
Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below. All smooth. Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back. There's a lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall. A cave. 
GABE (O.S.) Good news. There's a cave down there. 
GABE 
puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets the length of rope drop. It's thirty feet long. Not even almost long enough to get to the shelter. Gabe leans against the crack wall, drained. Now what? 
HELICOPTER - MOVING OVER MOUNTAINS 
Frank is in the air, heading back out toward the range, frantically working the radio. 
FRANK Maggie -- come in, Maggie, this is Rescue One -- 
TOWER FACE 
Frank's call is heard on the radio. Travers takes it, and takes charge. 
TRAVERS There's our ride out of here. Everyone out of sight -- except you, Kristel. (hands her radio) Make the distress call. You're so good at it. 
All scramble up towards the clearing. 
INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB 
We can see what Gabe couldn't -- the timer has about two minutes left -- 1:59 -- 1:58 -- 
GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE 
Gabe looks completely defeated. Can't go up. Can't go back in. Can't go down. 
MAGGIE (frantic) What are we going to do? 
GABE (defeated) Die. I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry you got into this. 
Gabe and Maggie fuse together in a tight embrace -- a final embrace. But Gabe opens his eyes as the rope, still in Maggie's hand, brushes his cheek. The end is frayed. 
Gabe's eyes light up. Inspiration. Gabe breaks off the embrace and snatches the rope from her -- he pulls at the end and furiously starts unravelling it. 
MAGGIE What are you doing? 
EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY 
Davis has just filled in Wright on the "unconfirmed" distress call. Wright looks furious. 
WRIGHT He didn't think a distress call from a crashed plane was "important"? (Davis nods) Get me a fucking radio! Now! 
EXT. HELICOPTER 
flying over the mountains. 
INT. HELICOPTER 
Frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and the facing Tower. 
FRANK (over radio) Come in, Maggie, over -- 
KRISTEL (O.S.) (over radio -- "weak") Alpha Charlie Niner -- please -- help -- 
Frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call". 
FRANK (over radio) I copy, Charlie Niner -- what's your position -- over -- 
An aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker. 
FRANK (over radio) Sit tight, Charlie Niner -- I'm right on top of you. 
GABE AND MAGGIE - AT THE CRACK'S EDGE 
Gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber -- it's three different segments wound together. The helicopter flies overhead -- and past. 
MAGGIE (shouting, waving) Frank! Down here! Frank! 
GABE Forget about it. He can't hear you. (hands Maggie some rope) Tie these together. Tight. 
MAGGIE (realizing) -- Are you out of your mind -- 
GABE This is rope from the Gordon exhibit. The way guys climbed then, they'd tie on three at a time -- this rope'll take around nine hundred pounds. 
MAGGIE Gabe -- this rope is sixty years old

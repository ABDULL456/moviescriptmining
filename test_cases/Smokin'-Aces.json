All manner of record as they might pertain to these events have been seized by the Department of Justice\" \nINT. VAN -- NIGHT \nWall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post, staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky, long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is labeled \"Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family.\" \nThe other is labeled \"Subject VICTOR \"BABY BUZZ\" PADICHE LIEUTENANT/Sparazza Family.\" Voices begin emitting over the van's speakers. \nSERNA (V.O.) Buzzy...Buzz...? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Yeah...Sid? \nSERNA (V.O.) You got clicks, anything? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Nah, nuthin' on my end-- \nSERNA (V.O.) --Okay...hang on, I gotta move-- \nMessner rides a digital console, tweaks frequency. \nMESSNER (keying mic) Zoom and pan please.   Stay tight. \nON THE MONITORS: The image pans, follows a figure moving behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom. \nSERNA (V.O.) Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop. \nPADICHE (V.O.) I'm here. \nMessner adjusts the record level, V-U meters spike, modulate. The figure on the monitors paces the room. WE SEE it's Serna. \nSERNA (V.O.) Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there-- \nPADICHE (V.O.) --he's doing it then, huh-- \nSERNA (V.O.) --yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose-- \nPADICHE (V.O.) --okay, g'head-- \nSERNA So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a \"specialist\" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing. \nPADICH (V.O.) --I see that, yeah, s'smart move, for us anyway. \nSERNA (V.O.) Trust me, we keep our mouths shut, go about our thing, play the part, nobody suspects us. (feedback distorts) The old man's on the fade Buzzy, fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I don't like saying that, but hey, our livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get? \nPADICHE No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now. \nSERNA (V.O.) Fuckin' A, first survive, yes? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm. \nSERNA (V.O.) Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up...Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ. \nPause. Feedback. The agents trade looks. Carruthers grabs a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other end to hear. \nPADICHE (V.O.) ...Jesus...what for? \nSERNA (V.O.) --who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate. \nPADICHE   (V.O.) Wow. \nSERNA (V.O.) Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave. \nPADICHE (V.O.) Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this. \nSERNA (V.O.) Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down. \nPADICHE (V.O.) That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves? \nSERNA Yeah, I can front this. \nPADICHE (V.O.) Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede? \nSERNA That's the punchline, y'ready? \nPADICHE Shoot. \nSERNA (V.O.) A million flat. \n", "test1_true": "SERNA (V.O.)

CASINO -- LAS VEGAS (PAST) \nNeon-framed doors fly open as a slicked-back chump with a store-bought tan strides out onto the strip, swinging underage bar-bait on each arm. He's all strut and punk swagger, grinning like a geek who just struck gold. \nDUPREE (V.O.) Buddy Israel, nicknamed \"Aces\" Born a bastard, mom Laverne chased the pipe dream from a Dairy Queen in Kansas City to the Vegas stage. Two months after stepping off a Greyhound, she gets knocked up by some hood. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nINT.

THE CAMERA FINDS Buddy's mother LAVERNE, prominent bulge, seriously pregnant, she's arguing with her employers, trying to suck in her belly, yelling \"bullshit, you just have to light it right...\" \nDUPREE (V.O.) Biological abandons her and the showgirl thing goes sideways so she winds up working as a magician's assistant to make extra cash. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nINT. CLUB -- NIGHT (PAST) \nSecond rate dive bar. Laverne Israel assists a pompadour- maned MAGICIAN on stage. In the lounge, sitting on a stripper's lap, a young Buddy plays with a deck of cards. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   POOL HALL -- NIGHT (PRESENT DAY) \nBamboo-style ceiling fans circulate cigar smoke and shitty attitudes. At a billiard table in the back: JACK DUPREE, 40's, third generation Bail Bondsman, talks with HOLLIS ELMORE, 30's and \"PISTOL\" PETE DEEKS, 30's, ex-Vegas vice cops. As Dupree speaks, WE SEE the scenes behind the story: \nDUPREE ...And young Buddy learns everything about cards from this Mandrake motherfucker his mom is working for... \nCUT TO SCENE: \nThe magician being brutally beaten-- pelted with poker chips, kicked in the chops, pissed on, the works. \nDUPREE (V.O.) (CONT'D) But magic man was also a degenerate gambler and got caught dealing bottom- deck at a mob-owned poker parlor. (beat) He didn't get outta there with much more than a pulse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL -- DAY (PAST) \nThe Magician, full body cast, taking his meals through a straw. Young Israel labors over him, performing card tricks. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nDUPREE Point is, he passed on all this slight of hand shit onto Aces and the kid is sick with it...By the age of twelve Buddy Israel is positively prodigal with a deck of cards. By sixteen, he's headlining the MGM's main room. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy, cards and coins dancing off his fingertips, dazzling sold-out crowds. Laverne Israel sits in the front row, decked out in ankle-length fur, applauding wildly. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT (PRESENT) \nDupree rounds the table, lines up a shot, leans over it. \nDUPREE This punk is pulling down ten bills a night and more showgirl geech than you can shake a stick at. Four years of sold-out shows, he becomes the unofficial mob mascot \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy meets mob hierarchy; silk suits and pinkie rings. \nDUPREE (cont'd; V.O.) (CONT'D) By the tender age of twenty-one he's breaking bread with the wheels, keeping company with major muscle. And it goes to his head in a big way \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy, poolside, glass of top dollar Dom in hand. Chicks, Coopertone and chasm-deep cleavage abound. \nDUPREE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...Wiseguys start to think this sonofabitch is a mystic, something special...and Aces plays it up, lets the legend grow, takes time off from his stage act and starts showcasing the chip on his shoulder. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy, tipping a craps table, attacking the stick-man, stripping off one of his gold chains, going garotte. \nDUPREE (CONT'D) He buys into his bullshit, building street cred, he's got plans and pull, he's makin' plays, living the mob life for real. Somehow, it takes: Lounge act turned legitimate thug. \nINT.

Extortionist.   Killer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY \nWE RECOGNIZE Carruthers and Messner as the two Agents from the Padiche/Serna surveillance. They are sitting with F.B.I. Deputy Director STANLEY LOCKE. A debrief is in progress. \nSUPER: WASHINGTON, D.C. \nA Mafia Family Tree has been erected behind them with a photo of Primo Sparazza at the top. \nLOCKE Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of \"The Turnpike Murders\" that was Sparazza. \nMESSNER I thought Heller was a double op? \nCUT TO SCENE: \nFREEMAN HELLER, 20's, clean cut Cornell grad, class of 1937. He's on a pistol range, scoring perfect marks. \nLOCKE (V.O.) No. He worked for the O.S.S. before joining the Bureau in its heyday. He was the first operative assigned with infiltrating the mob. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nHeller, outdistancing the rest of his recruiting class in a training run, nearly a mile ahead of the next man. \nLOCKE (V.O. CONTD) (CONT'D) Full immersion and assimilation, fake identity, falsified background, everything that is now standard operating procedure, Heller implemented, way back when. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nHeller oversees every aspect of his transformation, radically altering his appearance, adding different mannerisms, an accent, etc...befuddled FBI brass can only look on in awe. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) And as a result, his undercover work was wildly successful. He eventually reached the rank of Capo inside the Carlotta crime family...but through some internal slip-up, his cover was compromised and Primo Sparazza was given the contract to kill him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE -- NIGHT (PAST) \nA '51 Ford Fairlane, flush with an embankment, bullet perforated, dead-body draped. A top-coated gunman (presumably Primo Sparazza) stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN HELLER; faux mafioso, full-time federal agent. \nLOCKE (V.O.) There wasn't enough evidence to bring formal charges, so the case never went to trial. \nHeller collapses, the gunman looms over, levels a .45, FIRES. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Sparazza is a bit of a specter. Over the years, the serious crimes with which he was thought to be involved, including Heller's murder, could never be traced back to him. \nThe gunman slinks back to his car as we-- \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nLocke stands, distributes files. \nLOCKE A dedicated viciousness and a slavish devotion to mob doctrine had Sparazza's star on the rise. So the mob relocated him to Nevada and he became the unofficial head of the Las Vegas LCN. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nA PHOTOGRAPH of PRIMO SPARRAZA, sharkskin suit, vintage 60's coif, posing in front of The Riviera with a dour, pissed-off Frank Sinatra. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nMESSNER So he's personally issued the contract on Israel? \nLOCKE Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks. \nCARRUTHERS Made him a friend of the family. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nSparazza and Israel, Casino grand opening, flashbulbs burst. \nLOCKE (V.O.) ...His hand-picked protege, successor to the throne...and Israel played the situation very shrewd. \nA MONTAGE OF more photo-pos, Buddy Israel posing with mob power brokers, playmakers...smiling all the way to the top. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) ...Slowly amassing the loyalties of Sparazza's top men...with plans of toppling the throne. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy, late-night conspiratorial confab with Sparazza soldier. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nLOCKE (CONT'D) In doing so, he plunged the Carlotta organization into a civil war, splitting the family into dual factions. Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other. The infighting that followed drew the interest of nearly every major investigative body operating under the canopy of the federal government. \nMONTAGE \n", "test2_true": "LOCKE (cont'd; V.O.) Presently there are sixteen state and federally funded agencies, running concurrent criminal probes on select members of the LCN...With Israel (MORE) \nLOCKE (cont'd; V.O.) (CONT'D) being the primary target in virtually every investigation. \nCUT TO SCENE \nIsrael sits with a group of FBI agents, discusses a deal. \nMESSNER (V.O.) A marked man gets wise and wants to come in. \nLOCKE (V.O.) His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection. \nIsrael is walked out of the room as we CUT BACK TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nMESSNER So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart? \nLOCKE --Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing...The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real. \nSYKES (V.O.) How real...? \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINER -- NIGHT \nGreasy spoon soul food joint, packed lunch counter. Meet SHARICE WATTERS, 33 and GEORGIA SYKES, 24, Ebony stunners, ghetto queens, street assassins. They are sitting with their booking contact, LORENZO WYMAN, 41. He holds up a copy of a bank telex, sliding it across the table. \nWYMAN How 'bout six-figures for this fool? How 'bout that love? \nWatters takes the telex, gawks, shows the numbers to Sykes. \nSYKES Bulllllshit... \nWYMAN Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance \"show us your shit\" thing neither-- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya. \nWatters twirls her long braids, looks over at Sykes. \nWATTERS So me and Sis here, 'cuz we got a rep on a rise, we chipped some nails on some niggas, they want us to drop this mafiaoso so and so, magician, whatever-the fuck he is. \nWYMAN S'way it works girl. Ya'll done dirt, ya'll peeled some serious caps. Word travels. \nSYKES And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real? \nWYMAN No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me...Right now, what we got-- (nod to telex) --Is a number and a name...Buddy Israel. \nSYKES (to Loretta) What else did Padiche say? \nWYMAN He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy...I said good. (beat, grins) 'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive. \nMESSNER (V.O.) Like who? \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY \nThe Feds continue their briefing. \nLOCKE Like Pasquale Acosta, blood money mercenary. His countrymen have dubbed him the more dubious \"El Estrago\" (beat) The Plague. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nDeath personified; sun-cooked skin, black hole eyes, tattoos gouged out of prison boredom...This is PASQUALE ACOSTA. \nLOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D) American educated, fluent in over a dozen languages, did journeyman's work for CIA funded \"G-2\" and \"Archivo\" death squads in Guatemala and Chile...noted for his legendary torture techniques. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nAcosta clips car battery cables to the eyelids of a dissident. FLASH TO: Acosta scorching an off-camera scrotum with a blowtorch. FLASH TO: Acosta powering up a bore-drill as a semi-nude man screams and pleads. \nCUT BACK TO: \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Sought for war crimes and human rights violations in eighteen different countries. When he was caught by the SAS in Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and ID'd by Interpol. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nPasquale; prison cell filthy, feasting on his fingers. \nCUT BACK TO: \nLOCKE (CONT'D) On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished. \nMESSNER You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit? \nLOCKE Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that... \nDUPREE (V.O.) ...Then I'm sure you've heard of these guys...The Tremor brothers. \n", "test2_id": 2161, "test3_input": "BEANIE (CONTD) Damn girl, look out now! \nThe other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement.

PENTHOUSE BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nIsrael sweats like a stuck pig, pained, clutching his chest. \nDR. GILL (O.S. ON PHONE) --Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. (beat) Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you. \nISRAEL That's not possible. I told you. \nDR. GILL There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself. \nISRAEL Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry. \nDR. GILL No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry-- \nISRAEL --Fine, fuck, I got it...Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport. \nBuddy disconnects. Dr. Gill holds for a moment, clicks over to another line, dials a new number...waits. \nDR. GILL ...He's in Lake Tahoe. \nCUT BACK TO: \nBuddy still standing there next to the phone, wincing, breathing shallow, looking down, rubbing his chest. \nISRAEL Be cool, be cool, be cool...c'mon... \nHe walks over to the bureau, cut lines of coke await him. He bends, inserts a rolled hundred into his nostril. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) Just this last little bit, then we're done, just this tiny bit and that's it, that's it, all of it, over-- \nHe snorts. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- CONTINUOUS \nBeanie, trying to assist the ailing hooker. She lurches suddenly, retching, projectile-vomit dousing Beanie's Versace-- dripping dung-like from his shirt front. \nBEANIE Awwww, motherfuck me! C'mon woman! Hold your shit! This is silk! \nThe other hooker's titters turn to outright guffaws. Barf- girl takes umbrage, hurls her purse at them, rushing into the herd, throwing haymakers asswild, snatching wigs, sinking fake nails into skin, snapping them off, Van Helsing style. \nThe fur flies, a slugfest free-for-all. Ivy intervenes-- Beanie jumps into the fray, separating combatants-- one of \nthem wielding her pump heel like a pick-axe. Hugo heads another off hooker, hitting her like a blitzing linebacker. \nIsrael, who has walked back out, looks on with total disdain for what he's seeing...Then, he catches his reflection in a living room mirror, a profound sense of sadness there. \nISRAEL (to himself, quiet) ...How the mighty have fallen... \nWE PUSH PAST HIM... \nIn the distance, on the lake, a small boat, a man sitting inside, gazing up through a pair of binoculars. \nCARRUTHERS (V.O.) He's awake. \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"TAHOE SKILLET\" RESTAURANT -- MORNING \nThe Feds occupy a booth, black coffee for both. Carruthers clicks off a cellphone. Messner is engrossed in a file clipped with old surveillance photographs of Primo Sparazza. \nCARRUTHERS Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls. \nMESSNER No rest for the wicked. (beat, holds up file) Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this? (beat, reading) Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? (flips, reads) Elective plastic surgery, every single one-- \nMessner, turning the file toward Carruthers, pointing. \nMESSNER (CONT'D) --look at this, look at the work he's had done; nose, three times, eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw-- he's had his jaw done a dozen times. (MORE) \nMESSNER (CONT'D) You take every hasbeen actor in Hollywood they haven't been cut this much. \nMessner flips to another part of the file. \nMESSNER (CONT'D) Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny-- (beat, points) --A paternity suit...I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be. \nCARRUTHERS Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security. \n", "test3_true": "Carruthers nods, sips his coffee. \nCARRUTHERS He's stayed below the radar. You don't kill a hundred and thirty people without knowing how to tip-toe. \nMessner flips the file, finds a page paper-clipped with a photograph of murder/martyred Federal Agent Freeman Heller. \nMESSNER But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one? \nCARRUTHERS Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness. \nMESSNER Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked. \nMessner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing out the window, watching sightseers stream by. Carruthers glances at his watch. \nCARRUTHERS It's almost five a.m. in D.C. now. Locke said the lawyers from Justice had been in there since three o'clock yesterday afternoon. Israel's manager is acting as his attorney and that's what's holding things up. \nThe waitress arrives with breakfast, sets it down. \nMESSNER So he has no idea what's about to happen? \nCARRUTHERS No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by. \nMESSNER What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management. \nCARRUTHERS Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level. (beat, grins) Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters \"F.B.I.\" in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times. \nCUT TO: \nF.B.I. BADGE AND IDENTIFICATION \nIt fills the the frame. An O.S. voice explains: \nVOICE (O.S.)

I'd like to speak with your head of security. \nA pimply CASINO EMPLOYEE nods, dashing off to find the boss. Acosta glances around, takes in the eight-dollar-an-hour security, the array of quasi-armed guards...and smiles. \nDEEKS (V.O.) Where'd you get these? \nCUT TO: \nGuard uniforms, exactly like those we've just seen, worn by the Nomad's security staff. Maroon with burnished gold buttons and brown piping down the slacks. Three separate vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: \nEXT. PARKING LOT -- OFF THE LAKE -- DAY \nDupree and Deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off the lake. \nDUPREE Same place that rents the guard's uniforms. There's a shift change at 9am. Graveyard goes home and we can blend in with the day shift coming on. \nDEEKS What about access cards? Pass keys? \nDUPREE We'll have to get our hands on them. There's two separate units; Casino Floor/Count Room Security and General Hotel Security-- (annoyed, nods to car) Does he want to hear this or what? \nDeeks bangs on the hood of the car. \nDEEKS Hollis! \nElmore steps out, moving slowly to the rear of the car. \nDUPREE Nobody put a gun to your head. \nElmore leans against the bumper, bored. \nELMORE Yeah, we've been through that. \nDUPREE Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand. \nELMORE --Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I? (beat, to both men) Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip? \nDUPREE Your attitude sucks. \nELMORE I been accused of worse. (glancing at uniforms) What do we got...? \nDupree, dubious, does he continue...?   Fine. Fuck it. \nDUPREE Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks. (beat) There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift.

{"train": "SMOKIN' ACES \nWritten by \nJoe Carnahan \nFADE UP ON: \nTITLE CARD \nA narration accompanies this passage: \"The events depicted herein were believed have taken place in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. All manner of record as they might pertain to these events have been seized by the Department of Justice\" \nINT. VAN -- NIGHT \nWall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post, staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky, long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is labeled \"Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family.\" \nThe other is labeled \"Subject VICTOR \"BABY BUZZ\" PADICHE LIEUTENANT/Sparazza Family.\" Voices begin emitting over the van's speakers. \nSERNA (V.O.) Buzzy...Buzz...? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Yeah...Sid? \nSERNA (V.O.) You got clicks, anything? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Nah, nuthin' on my end-- \nSERNA (V.O.) --Okay...hang on, I gotta move-- \nMessner rides a digital console, tweaks frequency. \nMESSNER (keying mic) Zoom and pan please.   Stay tight. \nON THE MONITORS: The image pans, follows a figure moving behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom. \nSERNA (V.O.) Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop. \nPADICHE (V.O.) I'm here. \nMessner adjusts the record level, V-U meters spike, modulate. The figure on the monitors paces the room. WE SEE it's Serna. \nSERNA (V.O.) Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there-- \nPADICHE (V.O.) --he's doing it then, huh-- \nSERNA (V.O.) --yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose-- \nPADICHE (V.O.) --okay, g'head-- \nSERNA So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a \"specialist\" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing. \nPADICH (V.O.) --I see that, yeah, s'smart move, for us anyway. \nSERNA (V.O.) Trust me, we keep our mouths shut, go about our thing, play the part, nobody suspects us. (feedback distorts) The old man's on the fade Buzzy, fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I don't like saying that, but hey, our livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get? \nPADICHE No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now. \nSERNA (V.O.) Fuckin' A, first survive, yes? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm. \nSERNA (V.O.) Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up...Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ. \nPause. Feedback. The agents trade looks. Carruthers grabs a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other end to hear. \nPADICHE (V.O.) ...Jesus...what for? \nSERNA (V.O.) --who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate. \nPADICHE   (V.O.) Wow. \nSERNA (V.O.) Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave. \nPADICHE (V.O.) Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this. \nSERNA (V.O.) Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down. \nPADICHE (V.O.) That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves? \nSERNA Yeah, I can front this. \nPADICHE (V.O.) Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede? \nSERNA That's the punchline, y'ready? \nPADICHE Shoot. \nSERNA (V.O.) A million flat. \nLOCKE (V.O.) --Enforcer.    Extortionist.   Killer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY \nWE RECOGNIZE Carruthers and Messner as the two Agents from the Padiche/Serna surveillance. They are sitting with F.B.I. Deputy Director STANLEY LOCKE. A debrief is in progress. \nSUPER: WASHINGTON, D.C. \nA Mafia Family Tree has been erected behind them with a photo of Primo Sparazza at the top. \nLOCKE Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of \"The Turnpike Murders\" that was Sparazza. \nMESSNER I thought Heller was a double op? \nCUT TO SCENE: \nFREEMAN HELLER, 20's, clean cut Cornell grad, class of 1937. He's on a pistol range, scoring perfect marks. \nLOCKE (V.O.) No. He worked for the O.S.S. before joining the Bureau in its heyday. He was the first operative assigned with infiltrating the mob. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nHeller, outdistancing the rest of his recruiting class in a training run, nearly a mile ahead of the next man. \nLOCKE (V.O. CONTD) (CONT'D) Full immersion and assimilation, fake identity, falsified background, everything that is now standard operating procedure, Heller implemented, way back when. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nHeller oversees every aspect of his transformation, radically altering his appearance, adding different mannerisms, an accent, etc...befuddled FBI brass can only look on in awe. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) And as a result, his undercover work was wildly successful. He eventually reached the rank of Capo inside the Carlotta crime family...but through some internal slip-up, his cover was compromised and Primo Sparazza was given the contract to kill him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE -- NIGHT (PAST) \nA '51 Ford Fairlane, flush with an embankment, bullet perforated, dead-body draped. A top-coated gunman (presumably Primo Sparazza) stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN HELLER; faux mafioso, full-time federal agent. \nLOCKE (V.O.) There wasn't enough evidence to bring formal charges, so the case never went to trial. \nHeller collapses, the gunman looms over, levels a .45, FIRES. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Sparazza is a bit of a specter. Over the years, the serious crimes with which he was thought to be involved, including Heller's murder, could never be traced back to him. \nThe gunman slinks back to his car as we-- \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nLocke stands, distributes files. \nLOCKE A dedicated viciousness and a slavish devotion to mob doctrine had Sparazza's star on the rise. So the mob relocated him to Nevada and he became the unofficial head of the Las Vegas LCN. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nA PHOTOGRAPH of PRIMO SPARRAZA, sharkskin suit, vintage 60's coif, posing in front of The Riviera with a dour, pissed-off Frank Sinatra. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nMESSNER So he's personally issued the contract on Israel? \nLOCKE Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks. \nCARRUTHERS Made him a friend of the family. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nSparazza and Israel, Casino grand opening, flashbulbs burst. \nLOCKE (V.O.) ...His hand-picked protege, successor to the throne...and Israel played the situation very shrewd. \nA MONTAGE OF more photo-pos, Buddy Israel posing with mob power brokers, playmakers...smiling all the way to the top. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) ...Slowly amassing the loyalties of Sparazza's top men...with plans of toppling the throne. \nCUT TO SCENE: \nBuddy, late-night conspiratorial confab with Sparazza soldier. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nLOCKE (CONT'D) In doing so, he plunged the Carlotta organization into a civil war, splitting the family into dual factions. Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other. The infighting that followed drew the interest of nearly every major investigative body operating under the canopy of the federal government. \nMONTAGE \nCUT TO: \nINT. POOL HALL -- MORNING \nDupree chalks his cue, positions for a shot. \nDUPREE No? (off dull stares from Deeks and Elmore) Then you've both been living under the same rock, 'cuz these cocksuckers are infamous. Three brothers, same skank mom, different deadbeat dads, used for that suicide-kamikaze style shit. You heard about that huge shoot- out in Cleveland? \nDEEKS Is that the club that got wiped out a couple months back? \nELMORE What happened? \nDUPREE The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. DINNER CLUB -- NIGHT \nTHE TREMOR BROTHERS pilot a Dodge Barracuda right through the front window with wrecking ball bravado. Bodies scatter as the Tremors deploy from the car in full body kevlar, doing doomsday on the club. One of them fires up a chainsaw, chewing into the panicked crowd. Bodyguards blast back, but bullets play like spitballs against the Tremor's body armor. \nDUPREE (V.O.) Donald McGarey, the local union rep, is the mark. The Tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club, seven people dead, twenty-eight wounded. Just to get to this one guy. \nShotguns roar-- blast spreads obliterate-- a shitstorm of blood, spilled booze and busted glass-- \nDUPREE (CONT'D) --And they get it about as good as they give it. In the melee, one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed piece and is temporarily blinded, the other takes bullets to the lower back and can't walk. The third gets popped in the neck and passes out. McGarey gets out of the club alive...and not much further... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DINNER CLUB -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT \nThe blind Tremor, walking wounded, piggybacking his brother with the bum back, dragging the other by the scruff of his neck, unconscious across the concrete. Police sirens squeal. McGarey, the union guy, hairpiece hanging by a thread, crawling toward his car. The piggyback Tremor brother reaches into his blind brother's coat, grabs a revolver and unloads. \nLong live the teamsters...Not tonight. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. POOL HALL \nDupree chalks his cue. \nDUPREE They're speed freaks, neo-nazi's. Sworn to the swastika, supposedly read and recite \"Mein Kampf\" like Mother Goose...And these motherfuckers can go megaton at the drop of a hat. \nSYKES (V.O.) What's the name again? \nINT. DINER -- NIGHT \nWyman, Sykes and Watters, back at the greasy spoon. \nWYMAN \"Soot, Lazlo Soot.\" Lotta folks want this white boy clapped. Soot could be workin' for one 'em. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nCrammed pedestrian crossing, noon hour a trio of SUITS converse, shrouded by bodyguards. \nWYMAN (V.O.) Nobody really certain where he come from... \nThe party proceeds through the crosswalk, approaching them is a dark-suited man, expressionless, hands in his pockets. Others move past; a woman with shopping bags, a skateboard punk, a geriatric dog-walker and a man, full paralysis, mouth- op wheelchair, \"My Left Foot\" palsy. \nWYMAN (CONT'D) ...and when he moves on somebody, they the last ones t'see it comin'-- \nThe bodyguards perk up, sensing something. Dark-Suit, removing his hands from his pockets-- cellphone...Wrong guy. \nThe crippled cat, throwing a quilt off his lap, contorted face vanishing, two Uzi machine-pistols up, safeties off, triggers pulled-- BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! \nThe bodyguards get caught napping-- bullets blaze point blank. The three suits collapse. The phony invalid empties both guns, hops up from the wheelchair, hooks a passing truck and flees the scene...that, was LAZLO SOOT. \nDUPREE (V.O.) So what do you think? \nINT. POOL HALL -- BAR \nThe boys have retired to the bar for a round of dollar drafts. \nELMORE I think it's idiotic to continue this conversation. (turns, to Deeks) We're ex-cops which means we weren't great cops or even good ones. \nDEEKS Paying bills with bullshit casino jobs, sitting watch on slot machines. \nELMORE Which was a great gig until we we walked in here and started drinking. \nDUPREE The bond on Israel expires in eighteen hours, after that, it's a jump ball. Our window is now. \nDEEKS Who posted his bail? \nDupree pats himself down, searching for his cigs. \nDUPREE His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since. \nELMORE Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom. \nMAN ...he's here now... \nSparazza nods. The man exits. After a moment, the door opens again...and another MAN enters, walking slowly toward Sparazza's bedside. He sets down his luggage, a black leather valise. The travel tags originate in Stockholm: \nThe Swede has arrived. \nFADE TO BLACK \nFADE UP ON: \nSoaring across the pristine deep blue waters of Lake Tahoe. Rising, revealing the gaudy, mirrored glass tower of the NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO. We slowly DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING \nBUDDY ISRAEL, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. He absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch, telepathy. He gazes out at the snow-packed peaks. Behind him; post-bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. Prostitutes, passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto heels, lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays, coke-covered tabletops and tipped room service trays. - \nIsrael, sober now...contemptuous of it all. He starts walking around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield. His bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the hooker's wigs, tugging it free. Israel looks down, zooming in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and disdain. He steps, the wigs pulls. He stops and slips the bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains. \nHe shuffles, begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead enemy soldiers. One of his bodyguards enters; a bulging, slow-witted, ex-bodybuilder by the name of HUGO CROOP. \nISRAEL D'you talk to'm? \nHUGO (fetching Mylanta from the fridge) I got his machine. \nA beat. Israel fidgets, twitches, rubs coke residue from his nose and over his gumline \nISRAEL What'd you say? \nHUGO (gulping Mylanta) I said I got his machine. \nISRAEL No, what did you say on the machine? \nHUGO I left him a message. \nISRAEL I know you left him a message. What did you say! \nHugo looks up, seems confused. Moments pass. Israel, the patience of a gorilla, crammed into a canary cage. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) Jesus Hugo! (MORE) \nISRAEL (CONT'D) How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man! \nHUGO Okay. \nISRAEL Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!? \nHugo, still unsure, speaks in spite of it. \nHUGO I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned. \nISRAEL Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that? \nIsrael wrist-flicks a playing card, it embeds a sofa cushion like a ninja throwing star, right next to a beige coat. \nHUGO About what? \nISRAEL Look at the collar on that coat... \nHugo, wary, walking over, inspecting the coat from a distance. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) What's that look like, that stain? \nHugo edges closer, looks down at the coat, squints. \nHUGO I dunno...Cinnamon roll? \nISRAEL Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz... (reshuffles, stares) And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket. (beat, then) So y'got semen, human ejaculate-- (MORE) \nISRAEL (CONT'D) (checks watch) --that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers-- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a \"tough, deep down stain.\" \nHugo takes another pull off the Mylanta bottle, moving slowly, like most morons do, avoiding eye contact at all cost. \nHUGO I could have it sent out... \nISRAEL ...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out. (beat, cooling down) Now, the money question...To whom does that stain belong? \nHugo, gameface falling apart...Israel prods him. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) C'mon, somebody was banging one of these skanks, sans rubber-- (beat, assesses girls) -which is terrifying in its own right- pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined the last gift my mother gave me before she died. (snatching up coat) The way I see it, it's the same as if she was dug up, three months dead and it was shot right on her rotting corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled this feels! \nHugo. Long pause.   Big dumb blush. \nHUGO Do you want me to say I did it? \nISRAEL I was kinda hoping, yeah. \nHUGO Do you want me to say I'm sorry? \nPADICHE (leaning closer) \"Pushy?\" \nWatters, shaking her head, correcting him. \nWATTERS Pussy. \nThe old man blanches, doesn't quite understand the-- \nPADICHE --Uh... \nAnother beat. The girls let him dangle. Watters, lewd sneer, looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following; \nWATTERS Israel likes pussy... \nPadiche, recovering, nodding, nervous. \nPADICHE ...Oh...uh-huh, yeah-- \nSykes squirms under Watters lascivious gaze, but manages: \nSYKES And we like that he likes... \nYet another beat.    Padiche, wanting desperately to contribute. \nPADICHE ...Pussy? \nSYKES Correct. \nPadiche, big nod going from one girl to the other, he-get's- it-but-not-really. \nPADICHE ...Fabulous. \nHe extends his hand.   WE TRACK IT ACROSS IN C.U. as it meets with a male hand. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nINT. HOTEL ROOM -- BLACKJACK INN -- MORNING \nDupree and Deeks shaking hands with RUPERT \"RIP\" REED, mid- forties, showbiz-slash-mob attorney, low man on the totem at the Las Vegas based legal firm of \"Culpepper Brody & Reed\" \nREED Yeah, Jack, alright...hey-- (shakes Deeks' hand) Nice t'meet you. Rip Reed. \nDEEKS Pete. \nREED Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min. \nReed and Dupree shake.   Reed glances out in the hall before closing the door. \nREED (CONTD) (CONT'D) (to Dupree) Where's your third? This was a troika, no? \nDupree, finding a seat, almost under his breath. \nDUPREE He's...fuckin'...he's comin'... \nAs Elmore appears, Reed almost closes the door on him-- \nREED (extending hand) Hey, hey how r'ya, Rip Reed. \nELMORE Hollis.   Elmore. \nThey shake. Dupree shoots a look at Elmore, not pleased. Elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed. \nReed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk-- his bedspread is papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: Everything to make Buddy Israel's return to custody legally binding. He sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch. \nREED (to Deeks) So Jack tells me you're both ex-cops? \nDEEKS Yeah, that's right. \nDUPREE They worked as swingmen for the Vegas Vice squad-- (to Deeks) What? Five, six years? \nReed, digging a cigarette out of his pocket. \nREED Man the stories you guys must tell. I grew up soft myself, private schools, little blazers, you \"Talked it out\" nobody threw punches, t'this day, never been hit with a fist, Imagine that, huh? (MORE) \nREED (CONT'D) Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling little faggot-fairy when I smell trouble-- and I don't say this to be self-deprecating, I just don't have much of an opinion about myself, I mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more like you guys, barfighters, big swinging dicks, gettin' it done. Sadly. (lifts his shirt, exposes torso flab) This is it. It's...disgusting. (with a look skyward) Thanks God, dogpile a piss-poor physique with an small cock and hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it! (beat, to Dupree) Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I drink, forgive the rants, let's get at it here. This wanted felon fucking prick bastard Buddy Israel and the nearly one million dollar bail bond. \nDupree smiles, pats Reed on the shoulder, don't-sweat-this... \nDUPREE Rip, my right hand to God, we're gonna go in and recover this asshole and everybody's gonna leave the theater grinning. Trust me. \nREED That confidence translates bro, seriously, it does! Out-STANDING! \nReed, white-boy high-five, excruciatingly un-hip. Deeks and Elmore literally have to look away. Dupree can barely bear it. \nREED (CONT'D) I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear these things, little boosts, helps allay my fears, I pass that piece of mind along to my partners. (beat, then) Alright, so, couple primers for you guys, maybe things we might've looked past that you should know about...His hangers-on, these idiots Israel runs with, they're all \"packing heat\" \"strapped\" whatever the phrase is. Point two, Israel likes hookers, so you might run into a harem up there. Point three: He binges between a six- to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine habit that nobody knows about, so he (MORE) \nREED (CONT'D) and those hookers, will most likely be high. He also drinks, self- medicates, the whole cliche, y'know? The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch drunk. The seven-layer loser. (beat, exhales) I'm praying he puts up a fight, please, please, please, rape him if possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever-- \nBEANIE (CONTD) Damn girl, look out now! \nThe other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement. Beanie plucks the fallen woman up, shakes her off, straightens her out, pulls off the offending heels. \nBEANIE (CONT'D) (holding up heel) All these good for is poppin' them titties girl, but y'see what happens when you try to get around in 'em? \nThe hooker, covered in glass dust, stuck with shards, teetering, too out of it to care. \nCUT BACK TO SCENE \nINT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nIsrael sweats like a stuck pig, pained, clutching his chest. \nDR. GILL (O.S. ON PHONE) --Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. (beat) Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you. \nISRAEL That's not possible. I told you. \nDR. GILL There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself. \nISRAEL Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry. \nDR. GILL No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry-- \nISRAEL --Fine, fuck, I got it...Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport. \nBuddy disconnects. Dr. Gill holds for a moment, clicks over to another line, dials a new number...waits. \nDR. GILL ...He's in Lake Tahoe. \nCUT BACK TO: \nBuddy still standing there next to the phone, wincing, breathing shallow, looking down, rubbing his chest. \nISRAEL Be cool, be cool, be cool...c'mon... \nHe walks over to the bureau, cut lines of coke await him. He bends, inserts a rolled hundred into his nostril. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) Just this last little bit, then we're done, just this tiny bit and that's it, that's it, all of it, over-- \nHe snorts. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- CONTINUOUS \nBeanie, trying to assist the ailing hooker. She lurches suddenly, retching, projectile-vomit dousing Beanie's Versace-- dripping dung-like from his shirt front. \nBEANIE Awwww, motherfuck me! C'mon woman! Hold your shit! This is silk! \nThe other hooker's titters turn to outright guffaws. Barf- girl takes umbrage, hurls her purse at them, rushing into the herd, throwing haymakers asswild, snatching wigs, sinking fake nails into skin, snapping them off, Van Helsing style. \nThe fur flies, a slugfest free-for-all. Ivy intervenes-- Beanie jumps into the fray, separating combatants-- one of \nthem wielding her pump heel like a pick-axe. Hugo heads another off hooker, hitting her like a blitzing linebacker. \nIsrael, who has walked back out, looks on with total disdain for what he's seeing...Then, he catches his reflection in a living room mirror, a profound sense of sadness there. \nISRAEL (to himself, quiet) ...How the mighty have fallen... \nWE PUSH PAST HIM... \nIn the distance, on the lake, a small boat, a man sitting inside, gazing up through a pair of binoculars. \nCARRUTHERS (V.O.) He's awake. \nCUT TO: \nINT. \"TAHOE SKILLET\" RESTAURANT -- MORNING \nThe Feds occupy a booth, black coffee for both. Carruthers clicks off a cellphone. Messner is engrossed in a file clipped with old surveillance photographs of Primo Sparazza. \nCARRUTHERS Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls. \nMESSNER No rest for the wicked. (beat, holds up file) Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this? (beat, reading) Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? (flips, reads) Elective plastic surgery, every single one-- \nMessner, turning the file toward Carruthers, pointing. \nMESSNER (CONT'D) --look at this, look at the work he's had done; nose, three times, eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw-- he's had his jaw done a dozen times. (MORE) \nMESSNER (CONT'D) You take every hasbeen actor in Hollywood they haven't been cut this much. \nMessner flips to another part of the file. \nMESSNER (CONT'D) Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny-- (beat, points) --A paternity suit...I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be. \nCARRUTHERS Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security. \n--A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses. The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end. Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying thought, cut comically short; \"I had that car in high scho-- \nDeeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound. One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back, fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand. The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that. \nSeveral seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked, pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo. \nThe Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips, baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss. DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men, seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so. \nJEEVES TREMOR (still pissing) Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht! \nLESTER TREMOR (stops singing) Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't vacated yet, s'keep quiet. \nJEEVES TREMOR Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass. \nLESTER TREMOR ...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE! \nThis exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester. Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant- like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back. \nDarwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act. \nDUPREE (DEAD) ...I forgive you Darwin. \nDARWIN TREMOR Shoot, I appreciate that man. \nDUPREE If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too. \nDARWIN TREMOR You woulda? \nDUPREE Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude. \nDARWIN TREMOR Damn...alright then. \nDUPREE I don't mind now anyway. (MORE) \nDUPREE (CONT'D) You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that. \nDarwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly. \nDARWIN TREMOR Really? \nDUPREE I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them. \nDarwin wipes his eyes. \nDARWIN TREMOR Man, that's great. \nDUPREE I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry. \nDARWIN TREMOR You think so? \nDarwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as though Dupree we're smiling up at him. \nDUPREE I know so. \nDarwin smiles back down   at the corpse, wiping his nose on his sleeve. He reaches    down and pulls out Dupree's wallet. He spots the bondsman's   license, eyeballs the bail papers: He sees the name ROBERT   ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together. \nDARWIN TREMOR Damn Jack...you was after the same sacka shit as us...Small world. \nDarwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time. \nDUPREE Don't tell your asshole brothers you know about it, that money is for you old boy. \nDarwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree. \nDARWIN TREMOR I appreciate that pard...I wish I coulda been a better friend. \nDarwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers, Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head. \nDARWIN TREMOR (CONTD) (CONT'D) Alright enough grabassin' goddamit! We need t'get over t'that hotel. \nWATTERS (V.O.) We're already here baby. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- MORNING \nWatters is once again on her cellphone to Lorenzo. \nWYMAN (O.S.) (on the phone) So everything's cool then? \nWATTERS We sat down with Padiche, he tried to get some details which we wasn't gonna give up, but it's all good. We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I check in across the street. \nSykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators open-- and Israel's Hookers, post-brawl bruised, bloodied and barefoot, come staggering out. \nThey slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled. Sykes trades looks with Watters as if assessing something, nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. Watters then winks, something sexual there...it gives Sykes the shivers. \nThe Hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and summarily whisked away. Watters joins Sykes. The WOMAN behind the counter checking Sykes in, looks up to see Watters. \nISRAEL They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off! \nMECKLEN (O.S.) I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is. \nISRAEL Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, \"no jail time for my guys.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL -- WASHINGTON D.C. -- DAY \nMorris Mecklen, sleepless, sweat rings blossoming armpit to waist. He picks at the plate of room service food in front of him. A group of Feds and Fed lawyers linger in the b.g. \nMECKLEN And they're not going give there pally. They're bricking us on that particular issue. \nMecklen glances back over his shoulder, lowering his voice. \nMECKLEN (CONTD) (CONT'D) Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied-- \nISRAEL --and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you. \nBuddy's rubs his chest-- grimacing-- he lays back on the piano, hoists a vial of blow, presses a nostril, does a bump. \nMECKLEN (V.O.) And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to-- \nISRAEL I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want! (MORE) \nISRAEL (CONT'D) (beat, considers, looks over at Hugo) Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it-- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides-- \nMECKLEN --Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie-- \nISRAEL --this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough-- \nThe Feds are signaling Mecklen back into the main room. \nMECKLEN --Listen kid, let's not antagonize this any more. I got 'em backed down on the book and t.v. deals. They're agreeing to give you all the after tax profits, so you can come away with some chits and live comfortably. If we push this, they'll revoke your protective status, which nullifies any agreement you got with the government...Now that's mate and checkmate kiddo and once that happens, the shit'll start falling down around your ears, real fast. \nBuddy's head teeters back, bangs on the keys, sour chords, thinking...thinking...He takes the deck, firing the cards up in a perfect column above his head, snatching one random out of the air with his right. He turns it over, looks...Joker. \nISRAEL Alright...do it. \nIn the shadows at the far end of the room, tucked into the midday shadows, Ivy listens as his boss betrays them all... \nCARRUTHERS (V.O.) Israel just rolled. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TAHOE SKILLET\" RESTAURANT -- MORNING \nThe Feds, heading toward their car, Carruthers snaps his cellphone shut. \nMESSNER He's giving them up? \nCARRUTHERS All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move. \nMESSNER Did the Justice lawyers sign off? \nCARRUTHERS That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait. \nThey reach their car. \nMESSNER What about the sheriff's task force? \nCARRUTHERS Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse. \nSECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.) No, I'm sorry, the penthouse is currently under construction. \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- SECURITY ROOM -- DAY \nS.A. Gerald Diego, alias Pasquale Acosta, speaking   with \"Bill\" SECURITY SUPERVISOR for the Nomad. Banks of video    monitors surround them, displaying the various gaming areas   and VIP floors...two of the screens are completely blacked   out. \nACOSTA (to Bill) Can I speak to you privately? \nThe Supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one. \nSECURITY SUPERVISOR Gary, let's get our personnel up in the catwalk over twelve, that stickman has been acting odd and I don't like the rolls that table has been getting. \nEMPLOYEE Got it. \nAcosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and the supervisor in the room. \nACOSTA It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything. \nSECURITY SUPERVISOR And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore. \nAcosta laughs, keeps it loose. \nACOSTA So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction? \nAcosta, deadpan. \nACOSTA Bill-- (out of respect) Willliam... (pause) We're all dying... \nBill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last breath...Acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward a service closet. As he passes one of the video monitors... \n...WE SEE ON-SCREEN: The Employee entrance, grave and swing shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. Mixed in with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous best...The Brothers Tremor. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE -- DAY \nDarwin, Lester and Jeeves, clad in full security attire, standing apart so as not to appear together, heads down, hands shoved into their pockets. \nDarwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement, using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to communicate with them. They pass through and punch in, signing time sheets. The surrounding security staff oblivious to the new faces. The brothers enter the lower floors, moving through the hotel's fitness center and indoor pool. \nA kid does a cannonball as they pass as we... \nCUT TO: \nA clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching, gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air. \nEXT. LAKE --DAY \nElmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints, bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much. \nHe gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind. \nHe crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down, the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them... \nMESSNER (V.O.) Double homicide, gunshot vics, both of 'em dumped in the lake. That's where the Sheriff's task force is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR -- DAY \nCarruthers and Messner, hectic, speeding through the south shore of Lake Tahoe, cellphones pinned to their ears. \nMESSNER (back into his phone) Deputy, have you made any ID's? \nCARRUTHERS (cups phone, to Messner) Get a coroner's estimate too. (back into his cell) --Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent. \nMessner, nodding as he listens. \nMESSNER Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers in the car with me. (beat to Carruthers) You need to hear this. \nMessner clicks over, the deputies voice fills the car. \nSHERIFF DEPUTY --nd have a pending ID on a Jack Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out of Las Vegas. He was just rolled and printed by our medical examiner. \nMessner and Carruthers trade looks. \nCARRUTHERS Was there anything recovered? \nSHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.) We found a handwritten receipt in his pocket for what looks like uniform rentals. The name and phone number of the rental house wasn't listed, \nMESSNER What kind of uniforms? \nSHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.) Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms were just listed as maroon in color. \nCarruthers mashes the floorboard, brakes smoke, power swerve, slicing the rented Taurus across four lanes of traffic. \nMESSNER Alright, deputy, we'll be there as soon as possible, until we arrive, I need you to limit physical access and restrict movement to and from the crime scene. Clear? \nMessner clicks off. \nCARRUTHERS Maroon uniforms? \nMESSNER Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security? \nCARRUTHERS No. (beat, decision) I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake. \nCarruthers pushes 110mph, barreling toward the Nomad, blowing through traffic-- Both men pull out IFB/earpiece apparatus, plugging in, checking their signals. \nMESSNER You going up to the Penthouse alone? \nCarruthers pulls a .45 from his holster, driving with his knees now, he jacks the slide, checks for a chambered round. \nCARRUTHERS Yeah. \nThe slide releases-- \nSYKES (V.O.) That's a bad move. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL SUITE -- DAY \nSykes, grabbing her bag, dropping spare clips inside and starting for the door. \nSYKES ...I'm on my way out, I'm just gonna hang in the hallway until they start up in the elevators. \nWatters loads a red-tipped round into the breach of the Fifty. \nWATTERS Just get in there and do your thing baby...mamma gots you. \nSNAP ZOOM ON BULLET as she slams the action forward, loading the round WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK. \n...Dial tones over black.   A phone rings. A voice answers. \nFADE UP ON: \nA reel-to-reel machine activates, begins to record-- A sticker on the pick-up spool reads: \"PROPERTY OF THE F.B.I.\" \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE \nThe players take their places. Over these images WE HEAR: \nSERNA (V.O.) Buzzy...Buzz...? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Yeah...Sid? \nSERNA (V.O.) Right, you got clicks, anything? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Nah, nuthin' on my end-- \nVitoli, aka Lazlo Soot: arriving at the Penthouse level, exchanging nods with the security team, pushing his service cart out of the elevator and down the hall, through a metal detector, which goes off. Vitoli/Soot shrugs, gestures to his stainless steel cart. The security team wave him through. \nSERNA (V.O.) So how we lookin'? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done. \nSERNA (V.O.) Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh? \nPADICHE (V.O.) Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know? \nPasquale Acosta: Now wearing the nametag of \"Bill\" the recently deceased Security Supervisor. He buttons his red blazer, hanging the penthouse pass key around his neck as he moves through the lobby, carrying a small briefcase. \nSERNA (V.O.) That's what we're countin' on. What'd they say when you went for specifics? \nThe Tremor Brothers: Duffel bags straining with the horrible, shit inside. They move toward a service elevator, swapping pill bottles, downing overdose amounts, repeating \"Mein Kampf\" recitations as they push the elevator's call button. \nPADICHE (V.O.) Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing. \nSERNA (V.O.) Okay-- yeah, I can, I respect that. \nPADICHE (V.O.) How are we on time...? \nHollis Elmore: Frantically ringing the alley delivery doorbell of a local Souvenir Shop-- naked, frozen, delirious, near- death, he has dragged himself there. \nSERNA (V.O.) Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so-- \nPADICHE Well, uh-- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that-- where does that leave us? \nAgent Messner: Watching as the bodies of Dupree and Deeks are hauled from the lake by Sheriff's personnel. He walks the shoreline, searching for clues, on his cellphone, trying to reach Security at the Nomad. \nSERNA (V.O.) --in a foot race right now. Really a matter of who out hustles who, y'know... \nAgent Carruthers: Plugging in his headset as he reaches the front of the Nomad, leaping out, rushing inside, holstering his gun for the moment. \nPADICHE (V.O.) So we gotta get t'Israel pretty quick for this to fly, yeah? I think? \nGeorgia Sykes; Pulling a small revolver from her garter- holster, annoyed, rubbing the chaffed area, reaching the elevator, leaning back against the wall, waiting. \nSERNA (V.O.) Basically-- it'd really be the best thing right now, yeah. Can't give up the ship now Buzzy-- \nSharice Watters; Her eye going to the rifle-scope...she makes subtle adjustments to the targeting-ring-- P.O.V. -- Israel's penthouse sits in the crosshairs. We see a figure, just beyond the glass...a shimmering shape, moving within. \nPADICHE (V.O.) --No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya. \nSERNA (V.O.) Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel. \nPADICHE (V.O.) I'm working on it. \nSERNA (V.O.) Bag this fucker Buzzy. \nPADICHE (V.O.) It's gettin' done Sid. \nWatters tracks the figure-- finger finding the trigger as we SMASH CUT TO: \nBLACK \nFADE UP ON: \nIvy unbuttons his coat. A .50 Cal rides in his shoulder-rig. Israel averts his eyes. Ivy lets the moment load up...then; \nSIR IVY You believe in loyalty, don'tcha? (pause, then) 'Specially the kind of loyalty where an otherwise sensible motherfucker puts his own best interests aside to selflessly serve another. 'Cuz outside a goddamn dog, that kinda loyalty, my kinda shit, don't get any more dedicated, or deep, or devout... \nIsrael, unnerved now-- spots a small handgun sticking out of his bag. He covers it with the bedspread, looking up at Ivy. \nISRAEL ...what are you tryin' to say? \nCARRUTHERS (V.O.) What I've been saying. Get me your head of security right now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- SAME \nCarruthers, bracing the same Casino Employee Acosta braced earlier. College kid, patch-acne, panic-stricken, stammering, struggling, a phone stuck to his hand-- \nCASINO EMPLOYEE --I don't-- it's just-- I can't reach him. He's not picking up the extensio-- \nCARRUTHERS --I know that. Which floor are they on? \nThe kid's skittish gaze shifts, locking on a figure moving through the lobby. \nCASINO EMPLOYEE (with great relief) Wait-- He-- there, that's one of our guys ther-- \nCarruthers breaks off, moving for the man in the maroon jacket heading toward the elevator. He reaches him, puts a hand on his shoulder. \nCARRUTHERS Excuse me, sir. \nThe man turns...His nametag reads \"Bill.\" \nBILL/ACOSTA Yes. \nCarruthers badges him. \nCARRUTHERS Special Agent Donald Carruthers. We've got a situation developing here in your hotel. \nAcosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security supervisor. The pimply kid at counter eyeballs him, confused. Acosta steps behind Carruthers, blocking himself from view. \nBILL/ACOSTA How can I help you? \nCarruthers leads him toward an awaiting elevator. \nCARRUTHERS I need to get to your penthouse level immediately, I also need every other elevator with access to that floor evacuated and locked down. \nThey step into the lift. \nBILL/ACOSTA Is this an emergency? \nCARRUTHERS Let's hope not. \nThe elevator doors close behind them as we... \nCUT TO: \nElevator doors open to reveal: The Tremor Brothers, vibrating at varying speeds, pharmaceutical stares, simultaneously sharp and dull. Georgia Sykes stares back, bad vibes trickle up her back. She holds a moment. Doesn't board. \nSYKES I'm going down. \nDarwin looks her over, lecherous grin. \nDARWIN TREMOR Bet'chu are. \nHe mimics a blowjob, treating her like the hooker he thinks she is. Sykes wants to shoot him in the face. Lester and Jeeves oogle her as the doors begin to close. \nDarwin smiles wide and lewd. Sykes kisses her middle finger. \nSYKES ...Faggot-ass redneck... \nDarwin's smile turns scowl as the elevator doors slide shut. \nWATTERS What'd you say? \nSYKES Not you. Some assholes on the elevator...are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm \"working girls.\" \nWatters grabs her binoculars; sees the four prostitutes snub cigarette butts and start to head inside. \nWATTERS Alright, the ho train is exiting the station. They're coming to you... \nSykes waits a beat, then reaches for the call button to signal another car. WE FOLLOW HER FINGER to the \"up\" button and-- \nCUT TO: \nA blackened fingertip, trembling, barely enough force behind it to hold a delivery bell button down. \nEXT. \"LAKEY'S SOUVENIR SHOPPE\" -- DAY \nHollis Elmore, hypothermia-ravaged, racked by seismic-like seizures, body temperature terminally low. The delivery door is flung open and A KID of about twelve stands there; cross-eyed, coke-bottle eyeglasses, shirtless, wearing a rising-sun head-wrap and karate Gee. He says nothing. \nBEANIE (CONT'D) (almost to himself) Aw hell no you ain't just do that... \nThree more soundless shots from the 9mm put a humane end to these proceedings-- blowing Beanie's body over a sofa chair. His three-hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table. \nIsrael's calf-skin coat lies near Beanies dead body, a pool of blood surrounding it, soaking through and all the while... The phone continues to ring. \nINT. BEDROOM -- SAME \nIvy and Israel, oblivious to what's gone on, fifty feet away. \nSIR IVY What did you say to Mecklen? \nIsrael looks from the ringing phone-- to the gun in his bag-- no good-- Ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread. \nISRAEL That's probably him now... \nSIR IVY ...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest...and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical...so assume I already know. \nIvy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself. Israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at Ivy. He slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket, begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body, left to right, right to left. \nISRAEL A set of skills, God-given gifts, I close my eyes. \nHe does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to Ivy. \nISRAEL (CONT'D) King of Clubs...You pick up this deck, s'just playing cards, I pick up this deck it's a living, breathing thing. What do you see right now? You see exactly and only, what I choose to show you....That's illusion Ivy. That's the lie I tell your eyes. The manipulation of movement. Knowing where your gaze wants to go, guiding it there. Making the magic happen in that moment, that split- second, but seeing behind it, knowing it's all bullshit...Built on sand. (MORE) \nISRAEL (CONT'D) (cards flying crazy) I can show the Feds what they want to see too. And make it as real as this room. Make it more than smoke, more than mirrors...and that's why I'm valuable...and that's why you're not. (beat) I never wanted it this way. \nIsrael, a card slipping from his sleeve, into his throwing hand...Ace Of Spades. He keeps it cupped. \nSIR IVY Oh you ain't done a damn thing can't be undone Playa. The dye ain't even close t'cast. Y'wanna make some shit real? No stage, no and lemme say this one time... \nCUT TO: \nINT. LEARJET -- DAY \nLocke, inbound to Tahoe with a detachment of D.C. Agents accompanying him. He's examining contents from the confidential package he received earlier: PHOTOS of a post- op Primo Sparazza, plastic surgery shrink-wrapped, his face swollen and deformed, dozens of photos, dozens of dates. \nSIR IVY (V.O.) ...If you think old man Primo could twist your shit up... \nHe scans the surgical reports, specific sentences and words pop: \"MALIOFACIAL DISORDER\" \"DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE\" \"BULLET FRAGMENTS\" He keeps reading... \nSIR IVY (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...It ain't nothin' compared to what I 'bout to do here. Believe that. \nACOSTA/BILL (V.O.) I don't believe this. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME \n\"Bill\" aka Pasquale Acosta, hitting a walkie-talkie against his leg, checking for a signal-- faking the whole affair. \nACOSTA/BILL Battery's completely dead. \nCarruthers, behind him in the elevator, checking his cellphone-- \nACOSTA/BILL (CONTD) (CONT'D) Forget it, you won't get a signal in here. Have to wait. \nCarruthers, annoyed, stowing his cellphone. \nCARRUTHERS (re: wall phone) Can't you use the line in here to contact your people. \nACOSTA/BILL (not missing a beat) No, these phones are hardwired directly to maintenance. Once we reach the penthouse, I can call down and have the system taken off-line. \nCarruthers, absent nods, anxious. Acosta/Bill, back to futzing with his walkie-talkie-- going so far as to remove the battery-- --And that's when Carruthers sees it...Bill's fingers, flesh mottled at the tips, horribly scarred over-- \n--something clicks --memories fire --photostrobic... \nFLASH CUT TO: \nThe briefing in D.C., Supervisor Locke-- \nLOCKE Pasquale Acosta-- Mercenary-- \"El Estrago\"-- \"The Plague\" \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nCarruthers' expression goes black... \nLOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D) When he was caught by the SAS in Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and ID'd by Interpol. \nCarruthers stares at those fingers, backs against the wall, hand moving slowly toward his waist-- suspicions pique. \nCARRUTHERS Can't maintenance do that? \nACOSTA/BILL Do what? \nCarruthers unclips his belt holster. \nMARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D) (beat) Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big helper boy now, go on an' get those things and grandma'll rub your feet! \nWARREN My karate feet? My crazy Karate kick feet!! \nWarren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great, disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this. \nMARGIE You little angel-butt! Grandma'll rub those feet forever! \nElmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin-- sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall. \nMARGIE (CONT'D) Oh you silly-sil! Never mind, Grandma'll get it! \nMargie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub. \nWARREN (barking out) Bow to your opponent! \nWarren bows before he squares up and begins methodically delivering a \"Kata\" of punches and kicks...violently and expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore, helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with perspiration, works himself into a furious lather. \nELMORE (trying to speak) Pl-- kid, st-- stop... \nElmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection beginning to poke through   his karate   gee... \nMargie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep. \nElmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head, gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed. \nCUT TO: \nTELEVISION SCREEN \nWe slowly DOLLY BACK, revealing a different room. \nREPORTER (ON SCREEN) --the two men slain here earlier today as authorities speculate as to the apparent disappearance of a third. The names of the victims are being withheld, pending notification of family members, but Action Seven has learned that one of the deceased, identified as Jack Dupree-- \nINT.

NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- PARKING STRUCTURE -- DAY \nAgent Messner arrives, flanked by shotgun-toting Sheriff's deputies, local cops and Bureau field agents. They deploy, cordoning off the scene, taking control. \nWE SEE Hugo and Doc Gill, ducking down, Hugo still has the phone to his ear. As they approach a rear stairwell with a door that reads: \"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY: PENTHOUSE LEVEL\" two FEDS descend, chaining and bolting the door. \nHUGO Shit...answer the fucking phone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL -- PENTHOUSE -- SAME \nThe phone is still ringing as Soot, Browning 9mm at his side, stalks the voices coming from the master bedroom \nCUT TO: \nINT.

This doesn't make any sense, what's wrong with the rest of 'em? \nSuddenly, the stairwell doors are flung open, revealing Hugo and Gill. All guns whip simultaneously to that spot. \nHUGO (hands up) Whoa, hey-- hey-- hold-up, hold-up, I got the Doc, easy...

It spins to a gradual stop. She leans over him...the stiletto blade he used to dispatch \"Bill\" and hack Carruthers digits off has retracted back into his sleeve. \nSykes begins patting him down, moving dangerously close to that sleeve, her neck hovering right above that spot-- \nSYKES You jus' lay still, we goin figure out what the fuck ya'll were up t-- \nShe pulls Acosta's bogus ID...Gerald Diego: Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nSYKES (CONT'D) You ain't gonna believe this shit.

A handcuffed Ivy watches with them as the elevator doors open and a big plume of black smoke vacates the car, eerily cast light burns blood red within, infernal, hellish.

He hurls them. \nCAMERA MOVES PAST THEM, DOWN ELEVATOR SHAFT TO: \nSYKES -- Pulling extra clips from her handbag, securing them under her garter belt, dumping her heels in favor of hose. \nACOSTA -- Pant leg lifted, moving panther-quiet, tortoise- slow, unfastening the snap on his ankle-holster. \nc CARRUTHERS -- Near death, eyes locked on Acosta, his mortal ombatant, trying desperately to reach his own ankle holster. \nMESSNER -- Watching as his team moves into place around the e levator.

She takes up the Barrett, gazing through the scope, looking, looking, looking...stops...holy shit...it's her. It's Sykes. \nAnd she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing. A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed, backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control. \nNumbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it, hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her-- \nWATTERS (whispering) ...I loved you baby... \nBOOM! \nEXT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME \nA gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out, affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level, Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches... \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey... \nDarwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded tourist sweatsuit; \"Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!\" stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt Python against his hip. \nELMORE (nodding to Cuda) That your car? \nDarwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive. \nDARWIN TREMOR No, I'm confiscating it.

You understand that I'm dying now? That I've survived bullets and frostbite and raging fever-- (holding up hand) missing fingers and every fucking imaginable horror in between? \nDarwin...speechless...he's done. \nELMORE (CONT'D) And I'm asking you now, \"Is that your car\" and you can't even come clean and do me the decency of a straight answer, with the fucking state that I'm in!? \nElmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin. \nDARWIN TREMOR Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm sorry. \nELMORE You shot me and murdered my friends. \nDARWIN TREMOR I did. We-- yeah, I know. \nELMORE And threw us into the lake. \nDARWIN TREMOR Pretty much, yep. \nElmore, still nodding. \nELMORE And this is your car, isn't it? \nDARWIN TREMOR Mmm-hmm. \nELMORE But there were more of you? \nDARWIN TREMOR Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make it. \nELMORE Two of 'em? \nDARWIN TREMOR (nods, tears flow) Thass' right. (beat, wiping eyes) I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad. \nELMORE You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you?

Israel? \nMessner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide. \nLOCKE ...for a press release. Officially, he took his own life, suicide by hanging, something of that sort. Basic bullet points-- despondent over the turn his career had taken, troubles with the law, history of substance abuse and so on-- \nThe aide sees Messner approach. Locke follows her eyes, turns. \nMESSNER Where's Israel? \nLOCKE What are you doing here? \nMESSNER My debrief-- \nLOCKE (indignant) --will be handled back in-- \nMESSNER --no, we need to handle it now. \nLocke, angered, handing his clipboard to the aide, taking Messner by the arm, leading him away. \nLOCKE You were given instructions to get on that plane and return to Washington-- \nA gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away. \nMESSNER You're going to tell me why no call was made to inform us that the Israel situation had been \"altered.\" Why I-- and my friend and partner, whose body is going into a furnace tomorrow, were not sufficiently apprised of Bureau movement on this matter. \nLocke, pale, shook up. \nLOCKE I can't discuss-- \nMESSNER --You can and you will. \nLOCKE You're finished. \nMESSNER And you just figured that out? (jams gun into ribs) The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant...why? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. CEDARS SINAI -- I.C.U. -- RECOVERY ROOM -- DAY \nLocke and Messner enter. In an oxygen tent erected on one side of the room, sits the shrunken figure of Primo Sparazza. On the other, a barely conscious Buddy Israel. Both men are hooked up to multiple I-V's and heart monitors. \nLOCKE ...They're father and son... \nMessner turns back to Locke, mind racing, searching his memory, sparking to-- \nFLASH CUT: \nThe Diner. The day before. \nMESSNER ...A paternity suit, filed 1967... \nCUT BACK TO SCENE: \nLOCKE --Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by-product of. \nMessner turns back, gazing at Israel and Sparazza. \nMESSNER ...Does he know? \nLOCKE ...He does now... \nIsrael and Sparazza glare at one another across the room with pure, unadulterated hated for the other. \nMESSNER So the wiretaps of Padiche and Serna-- \nCUT TO: \nThe reel-to-reel machine spins: \nSERNA --some Swede, real badass, supposedly a \"specialist\" \nCUT BACK TO: \nLOCKE Dr. Sven Ingstrom is head of cardiology at Stockholm University and the foremost heart specialist in all of Europe-- \nMessner...words can't begin to describe his dismay. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice. \nMESSNER So all of our intel was bogus to begin with. \nLOCKE Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. (MORE) \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll. \nMessner steps closer to Locke, close enough to throttle him. \nMESSNER ...When did you know all this? \n", "test1_input": "EXT.

Smoke clears, her field of vision through the scope expands, sharpens. \nWATTERS (CONT'D) Georgia goddamn baby, please talk to me, please say somethin' so-- \n--And that's when she spots the call girl, face obscured, lying dead from a headshot in the hallway...her heart sinks...and she assumes the worst: Sykes is dead. \nWATTERS (CONT'D) MOTHERFUCKERS!! \nShe flicks to full-auto and opens fire right through the glass in front of her-- big gas-ejected shells pop from the breach like bowling pins-- the gathered throng across the way in the Nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage of heat, blood and building chunks-- Watters bucks big sobs, blasting away with the Barrett... \nWATTERS (CONT'D) M'SORRY BABY! I'M SO SORRY! I LOVED YOU SO MUCH! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR -- SAME \nSykes, standing now, knock-kneed, kevlar discarded, down to a black bra and mini-skirt, blood dribbling over her midriff, deep indentation near her sternum-- big yellow bruise in bloom-- the bullet didn't penetrate...her elevator arrives at the penthouse level and as the doors open we-- \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME \nDarwin, looming over Ivy, about to bring the sledge down squarely on his skull-- the elevator doors open in his periphery... He looks over, sees Sykes standing there, barely clothed, wet with blood, gun in her hand...and grins. \nSykes, seeing Darwin standing over Ivy, holding a sledgehammer-- recognizes him as the perv from earlier. She levels the Glock, stepping out of the elevator, steadying herself against the wall, steadying her aim on Darwin's head. \nSYKES Drop that hammer... (beat, cocking gun) And I drop this one. (beat) Know a killer motherfucker...know they voice. Know they feel...and know you 'bout to die by one. \nThen, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum, building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME \nThe chopper draws closer, growing louder-- Hugo, still trying to crawl toward his downed boss. Soot finishes him off with a flush headshot. Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and beating. His watery gaze moves from Gill to Soot, who know stands overtop of him, aiming the 9mm down at him. \nIsrael averts his eyes...the end has come. He looks over and sees his lamb-skin coat, lying there, soaking in Beanie's blood, ruined beyond recognition. A tear escapes his eye. \nISRAEL ...forgive me... \nSoot puts the gun flush with Buddy's skull when suddenly, the ceiling begins to tremble and shake...the sound of a helicopter filling the air. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME \nMessner is losing Carruthers, can't revive him, begins to crack-- hammering on his chest...it's no use. He's dead. He sobs-- something slides from his pocket. He glances down... \n...sees that the bag containing Elmore's severed fingers has fallen from his pocket. Doesn't remember hanging onto them. He replaces them in his pocket. Looks down at his dead friend, sees his severed hand, also missing fingers... \n...the absurdity of this makes Messner want to cry laughing... \n...and that's when he hears the chopper...and sees it as it rises up past their floor, past the contingent of Cops and Feds slugging it out with Watters across the street. \nINT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME \nWatters, ears ringing with gunfire reverb, reloading-- salvos of return fire ripping back at her-- then, all at once, the shooting stops-- She pauses, thinks it's a ploy-- then slowly peers over the window sill as the Bell-Ranger comes into view, over the Nomad, touching down on its narrow rooftop. \nINT. PENTHOUSE -- SAME \nThe doors to the Penthouse level are bashed open and the windows implode as FBI tactical agents repel in, weapons drawn, swarming, surrounding the scene, shouting commands-- Darwin Tremor drops the sledge, jackrabbits for the elevator, diving in as the doors close-- \nSykes, stumbling toward Ivy. He sees she's injured, scoops her up like a new bride-- she places something in his hand...Acosta's fake FBI credentials. Ivy looks, nods, gets it-- agents approach, combat crouches, MP-5's at arms. \nAGENT #1 Let me see your hands! \nIvy, flashing the I.D., taking care to cover the photo. \nSIR IVY This woman's been shot, I need to get her medical attention immediately! \nCommotion and confusion swirl. The Agent, unsure, searching for some confirmation-- can't find it, dismisses them and rushes into the Penthouse. Sykes and Ivy slip out the exit. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME \nSoot, disarmed, handcuffed. Israel, propped up, sweating badly, seizures still hobbling his heart. Gill, being patted down by the Agents, prescription pills confiscated. Soot is held at gunpoint and flex-cuffed, the remainder of rubber appliance pulled off his face. \nThe agents begin to initiate an \"All Clear\" over their radios. Moments pass before Deputy Director Locke enters the room, He approaches Soot, studies him, to one of the agents; \nLOCKE Soot? \n", "test2_id": 2161, "test3_input": "The Agent nods confirmation. Locke reaches into Soot's coat, finds his cellphone...hits redial. \nLOCKE (CONTD) (CONT'D) (into phone) Would you join us please... \nLocke disconnects, passes the phone to an underling. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) Where are Carruthers and Messner? \nAGENT #1 Agent Carruthers was killed sir, (as Locke turns back) Agent Messner is unaccounted for. \nLOCKE Account for him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRWELL -- SAME \nMessner, bounding up the steps, gun drawn, hears voices coming down the stairs toward him-- stops, checks his weapon... \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAIRWELL -- SAME \nIvy and Sykes descending the stairs. He carries her like a princess, sweeping her down landing after landing. \nSIR IVY What's your name baby girl... \nSykes, somehow shy, sweet, gazing up at him. \nSYKES ...Georgia. \nIvy, big smile. \nSIR IVY Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man. \nSYKES You know I did baby... (smiling, assessing) And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like-- \nSIR IVY --never in a million girl-- \nSYKES --good, then all you got to be is grateful. \nSIR IVY No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills. \nSYKES You love her? \nSIR IVY My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask? (beat, sees her wounds) You hurtin' pretty bad? \nSYKES (nodding) Got hit twice. \nSIR IVY It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch. (beat) I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today. \nSYKES Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby. (taps her gun) Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas-- \nSIR IVY For real? \nSYKES Mmm-hmm...and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em. \nSIR IVY True? \nSYKES Like a mafucka. \nSIR IVY That takes some of the sting out. \nSYKES I probably woulda busted on you too ...and what a shame that woulda been. \nSIR IVY I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever. (beat, smiles) You gonna lemme see your scars? \nSYKES You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow. \nSIR IVY What were you doin' here anyway? \nSYKES 'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel. \nThis gets Ivy's biggest grin. \nSYKES (CONT'D) Damn baby girl, you makin' a nigga fall hard now. \nHe reaches the seventeenth floor, rounds the corner, nearly runs into Messner, has a gun thrust in his face. \nMESSNER F.B.I. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! PUT HER DOWN, GET UP AGAINST THAT WALL! \nSykes recognizes him and in a blink has a gun under his chin. \nSYKES Don't play out this string, 'cuz it's real short I didn't do your man downstairs. I found him that way. Now whether or not you believe that ain't the least bit important. We either goin' work this out and live, or stay doin' the shit we been doin' and die. Now I got no beef with you, or wit ya'll bureau...so you better off jus' movin' on & lettin' us be. \nMessner, eyes moving from Ivy to Sykes. Stalemate, no sense pushing. He moves past them, hits the stairwell exit on eighteen. Ivy and Sykes resume their trek down the stairs. \nINT. HALLWAY -- PENTHOUSE FLOOR \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR \nDarwin, on his way down, rolling around on the floor of the car, covering himself in congealed blood and bullet casings, slicking back his hair, losing the security jacket, splashing yet more blood on himself. Satisfied, he snatches Carruthers' F.B.I. credentials up off the floor...and waits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME \nThe elevator arrives at the far end. A small asian man carrying a stack of clean towels steps off and starts down the hall-- sees Watters, sees the .45 trained on him-- does an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car. \nWatters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance. Down below, Watters can see a bevy of law enforcement personnel streaming toward the Horizon. She slowly takes the Barrett off the ledge, begins breaking it down, glancing up at the Penthouse of the Nomad as we... \n...CUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT -- SAME \nDirector Locke waits. Messner and The Swede appear in the doorway. The Swede nods to all concerned and starts toward Israel. Doc Gill acknowledges the Swede. \nDR. GILL Dr. Ingstrom, he's had a mild cardiac episode and recurring arrhythmia, I've given him 60cc's of Nobuneatol... \nThe Swede kneels down next to Israel, dropping his black valise, cracking it open. Messner, dazed, dumbfounded, sees Locke. \nMESSNER ...Deputy Director Locke? \nLocke approaches, lays a comforting arm on Messner, guiding him to a chair. \nLOCKE Here. Sit.   Please. \nMESSNER (pointing to Swede) This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor? \nLOCKE Difficult to explain everything now... (beat, toward Israel) And much larger issues loom. (beat) I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest thing to have to die for. \nThe Swede, working on Israel, shaking his head, something's wrong. He stands, crosses to Locke, silently confers. \nLOCKE (CONT'D) (to The Swede) Very well. (to other Agents) Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll be traveling with us. \nSuddenly, Soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the shattered Penthouse windows, launching himself-- a swan dive out into the open air-- He hangs there for a moment, an aesthetically striking form; like Lazarus cast against a cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below-- \n--till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth, sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below. This startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a collective lack of concern. \nMessner is absolutely agog. \nMESSNER (to Locke, forceful) What the hell-- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead! \nLOCKE We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days. \nLocke says no more-- starts out of the Penthouse with the Swede, Dr. Gill and Buddy Israel in tow. A Bureau forensics team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...Messner stands there, absolutely agog. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY -- DAY \nHives of activity. Cordons and crime scene lockdowns like onion layers, multiple law enforcement agencies, confounded, confused-- too many cooks, too many kitchens. Nobody knows who the hells in charge. Local paramedics and EMT's cart out the wounded. Coroners and M.E.'s cart out the dead. \nReporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades outside, competing for coverage, as-- \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL: \nAcosta is wheeled through the lobby, hooked up to IV and oxygen, looking ghastly, like something exhumed. He catches the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink. \nHe's flex-cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall for the moment as the Agents move off to deal with the recent appearance of Lazlo Soot-- whose body has been unceremoniously splattered over the parking lot. \nAs the Agents depart, Acosta peers down at his shackles; simple plastic binding rods-- he smiles...a moment later the stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as-- \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL: \nDarwin Tremor staggering out of an open elevator, blood- sodden, head down-- FBI badge held aloft for all its worth. Playing it up, free pass, Agents rush in, hold him upright, help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as-- \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL: \nIvy and Sykes, being released from the stairwell, cut chains sliding off-- Ivy holds up pilfered FBI creds. Rampant confusion makes the moment possible. He's waved through, carrying Sykes, looking every bit the good Samaritan. \nSykes, a mess of mascara, adorned in her unmentionables, looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be-- she spots the woman at the counter from earlier. The woman gazes back, jaw agape. Sykes can only shrug...if you can't beat 'em-- join 'em. She and Ivy cross the lobby as-- \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL: \nMessner...morose, exiting another elevator with the sheet- draped body of Carruthers on a gurney. Gandersen, the Nomad owner, spots him, starts over, looks to unleash, gets close enough to catch Messner's expression. Sees it in his eyes...enough dead bodies for one day. Messner continues moving through the lobby, hears the chopper taking off as-- \nCAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL: \nThrough the clear glass atrium of the Nomad, the Bell-Ranger goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter sky, banking south toward Las Vegas. \nCAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL: \nThe Horizon hotel across the way: The Fourteenth floor window. \n", "test3_id": 2162}

{"train": "TAMARA DREWE \nWritten by \nMoira Buffini \nBased on the book by \nPosy Simmonds \n20th October 2009 \n1 SUMMER. POSY DRAWING 1 \n2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2 \nAndy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time. \nTESS (V.O.) And love slipped the bonds of restraint... At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties, funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring at Andy. \nTESS (V.O.)(CONT'D) His touch was like a cosmic `yes'. Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad, writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work. \nEUSTACIA (V.O.) `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck you to hell!' Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew.' \n1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A \nSitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ; a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes, books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. \nGLEN (V.O.) This complex contemporary matrix is what Hardy meant by `the ache of modernism.' He regards it. \nGLEN Crap. He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'. \nNICHOLAS (V.O.) Inchcombe had seen it all before. He'd seasoned it: the metallic smell of blood and gunshot; forensics hunched like vultures. The dreadful mundanity of murder, he thought. \n3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3 \nNicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure. \nNICHOLAS (V.O.) He approached Patel, who was stricken. She was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity. Inchcombe realised a disturbing truth. His lack of feeling was almost... (He stops writing. Sighs) \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) Pathological... \n4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4 \nA playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from a magazine. \nCASEY `I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' said Katie. `I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one.' Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs. \n4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A \nA woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty, she's now mumsy and countrified. She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection. Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up. \nBETH Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough? It's very hot out there... \nMARY Beth - they're writers, not babies. You run round after `em too much. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 3. \n5 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 5 \nGlen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits. \nBETH Can I tempt you, Glen? \nGLEN Wow, thanks. Glen picks up a scone. \nBETH I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day. I know how the brain needs feeding. How are you settling in? \nGLEN Great. The last writer's retreat I stayed at kind of froze my balls off, you know? \nBETH Oh. \nGLEN Screeching firedoors, curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom I still bear the scars. \nBETH We try to keep it peaceful here; far from the madding crowd. \nGLEN Well, it's paradise. \n6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6 \nThe blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's shatteringly dull. Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom is epic. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4. \nAn open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the enjoyment of the middle aged couple within. \nCASEY Frock horrors. This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto. \nJODY She looks like a bug. (Car hoots) Wankers! \nCASEY You wanna sack your stylist girl. \nJODY Bet they did that on purpose, dressed her up like an insect. Casey agrees. They zoom away. \n7 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS. 7 \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6A. \nBETH Would you mind? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight; could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry. Beth looks distant, troubled. \nANDY You OK? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7. \nBETH Yes. Nicholas and I are going out to dinner. As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of puzzled dislike on his face. \n9A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 9A \nGlen settles back in his chair. \nGLEN It's paradise... \n10 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 10 \nNicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in desperation. \n10A I/E. DAY. TAMARA'S CAR. 10A Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign \"Ewedown\". \n11 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET. 11 \nThe same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both land on the windscreen. \nJODY Fucking bingo! Jody and Casey run away, laughing. \n11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A \nThe driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She looks around shocked, for the culprit. The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as well be a landfill site. \nTAMARA What a dump. As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7A. \n12 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 12 \nTamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move. \n12A DELETED 12A \n14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14 \nAt the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown, neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of recent abandonment. Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She backs away. She doesn't know what to do. \n13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13 \nJody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop. Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction. One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out, shoo-ing them away. \nJODY We could walk up the garage. \nCASEY I'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield. \nJODY They keep you busy. \nCASEY Yeah. \nJODY You never stop, you! Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and Casey are not impressed. \n15 DELETED. 15 \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 8. \n16 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 16 \nThe writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving dishes dangerously. \nGLEN It was called `From Hearth to Heath - Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian verse.' \nTESS What was it about? \nGLEN Oh you know. Pale poets on laudanum, dark towers and sunless seas - a little sturm and drang in a teacup. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 9. \nAt an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to herself and then abandon the idea. \nTESS Did it sell? \nGLEN Well my kind of books aren't about sales. I mean that's not why I write. So... no. \nTESS What are you working on next? Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a blouse. \n17 INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. BETH'S BEDROOM. 17 \nBeth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll find some excuse. \n18 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 18 \nGLEN Thomas Hardy. \nDIGGORY Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore? \nGLEN Excuse me but there is nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception. \n19E INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. KITCHEN. 19E \nIn the kitchen, Andy picks up his plate and goes. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12. \n19F INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19F \nBeth is incandescent. \nBETH How can you lie to my face? \nNICHOLAS Can we talk calmly about this? There are people out there - \nBETH You look me in the face and LIE! \nNICHOLAS For God's sake; we're surrounded by \nNOVELISTS - \nBETH You BASTARD! \n19G EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO) 19G \nA thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers (with the exception of Glen, who is mortified) are poised like scavengers, waiting for more. \n19H INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19H \nNICHOLAS Beth, we're like a pair of compasses... \nBETH Don't you dare - \nNICHOLAS Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps. \nBETH That's from her isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting? Nicholas finally snaps. \nNICHOLAS We've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore! \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12A. \nBETH (leaving the house) Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more. It makes me feel WORTHLESS! \n20 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20 \nCasey gawps, fascinated. Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed. \nNICHOLAS Calm yourself down! \nBETH (O.S.) Go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax return. \nNICHOLAS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Will you please - \nBETH (O.S.) Do you love her?? Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13. \nNICHOLAS \n(FIRMLY) This is pointless. \nBETH Is she young? \nNICHOLAS For heaven's sake. \nBETH \nIS SHE? \nNICHOLAS \nYES! The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into the house. \nBETH (O.S.) If you leave here tonight to be with her... Don't come back. \nNICHOLAS Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise. \nNICHOLAS You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit. \nBETH Liar. Glen cringes. Beth slams the door. Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car. \nDIGGORY I didn't know they provided material too. \n20A INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 20A \nBeth, her back to the door, is regretting her gesture. \n20B EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20B \nEUSTACIA Beth does everything for him you \nKNOW; \n(MORE) \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13A. \nANDY Was. Born in that room up there. He points up at the back bedroom window. \nGLEN You must have been pretty resentful. \n33 1995. EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE LANE. 33 \nAn eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse. \nANDY Hey. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A. \nThe girl turns. She has a huge nose. \nANDY This farm's mine, big nose. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22. \nThe girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air. \n34 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 34 \nAndy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house. Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box. \nANDY Hey, what're you doing? Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack. \nANDY (CONT'D) Who are you?? \nTAMARA Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition. \nANDY Tam?... Hardly recognise you. Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal. \nANDY (CONT'D) You won't do it that way. \nTAMARA Then help me! \n35 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 35 \nAndy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen. \nANDY Used to do bits of work for your mum. Been keeping an eye on the place since she died. \nTAMARA What sort of work, graphics? \nANDY I do horticulture now. \nTAMARA You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23. \nGLEN This is a great old house. \nTAMARA Would you like to buy it? \nGLEN I'm not really the property-owning kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand luggage. \nANDY That's why you're back, to flog it? \nTAMARA Yes. \nANDY Make a nice second home for some banker wankers. \nTAMARA Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer? \nANDY Because sadly I'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land. \nTAMARA Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. \nANDY Tam. Their eyes meet. \nANDY (CONT'D) What the fuck have you done to yourself? Tamara's face falls. \n36 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 36 \nGlen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding. \nANDY She's completely different. \nGLEN How was she before? What's the story?... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24. \nANDY There isn't one. \nGLEN Come on. \nANDY Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a teenage thing. \n37 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED. 37 \nTamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans. She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out of the way. They kiss passionately. \nANDY You should find someone you're in love with. \nTAMARA You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 27. \nGLEN Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how do you do that? \nNICHOLAS Well, Greg - \nGLEN \nGLEN - \nNICHOLAS I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips. \nGLEN Matter of fact I read one of your books. Another distraction but I thought it was decent stuff. \nNICHOLAS Well. He's offended. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his breath, Glen impersonates: \nGLEN `We call them biscuits, here.' Nicholas raises his glass for a toast. \nNICHOLAS To the muse, however you find her. He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts, his glass still in the air. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) Who's that? Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28. \nGLEN That's Tamara Drewe. \nNICHOLAS No it isn't. \nGLEN I met her with Andy. \nNICHOLAS Good God. What's happened to her? \nPOPPY She's had a nose job, Dad. \nNICHOLAS She's completely different. \nGLEN That's what Andy said. \nBETH Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She used to come and help you wash the car, didn't she Nicholas? I think she liked a bit of family after her dad left. \nTESS Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays? \nBETH Used to. Writes for the Independent now. \nTESS She spent weeks going on about her nose job. Smart way to pay for it I suppose. Was her old one an awful conk? \nNICHOLAS Yes. \nBETH She's poured herself into those shorts. I hope they don't give her thrush. \nTESS What's the etiquette with nose jobs? Do we mention it, or... Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28A. \nTAMARA Hello. Sorry to intrude. Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards her, full of warmth. \nPOPPY Hey, Tamara. \nTAMARA Poppy, how are you? \nPOPPY Love your new hooter. \nTAMARA Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 29. \nAt last Beth remembers her manners. \nBETH Tamara, so sorry about your mum. \nTAMARA Thank you... \nBETH Are you staying down for a while? \nTAMARA I'll have to. There's so much to be done. \nBETH You must let us know if we can help. \nTAMARA Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and - \nBETH Nicholas? - Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word. \nGLEN I'm available. I do skips. \nDIGGORY I... No. \nTAMARA Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers. \nBETH Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons. \n43 EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 43 \nTamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts. \nTAMARA Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood. \n48 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 48 \nGlen is preparing to leave. \nGLEN You told her the truth... The time might come when she respects that. Andy, as your love guru, I suggest you ask Tamara for a date. But take a shower first, OK? \nANDY \n(SMILING) Piss off, Glen. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33. \n49 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 49 \nTamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon. \n50 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 50 \nNicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he can't quite believe what he is seeing. \n51 1996. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 51 \nNicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car. \nTAMARA Boys know nothing. Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops work. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) I've been reading `Inchcombe's Dose.' \nNICHOLAS Have you? \nTAMARA The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter. Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth closer to his. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) You describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile. So... She turns her head. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Who did you base her on? \nNICHOLAS What? \nTAMARA Have you noticed me? Nicholas looks at her in surprise. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Because I've noticed you... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A. \nShe waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a hand - almost touches him. He steps back. \nNICHOLAS Think it's time you went. Tamara is mortified. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) You're making yourself ridiculous. This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car - and Nicholas. \nTAMARA Nicholarse. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) Oh, grow up. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 34. \n52 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 52 \nNicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze. \nGLEN A man can dream, huh? Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what he's talking about. \n53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53 \nTamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom. She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up. She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks lost. \n54 EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN. 54 \nTamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy. He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat. \nANDY Go on Ingrid; have some kids. \nTAMARA Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) And he stinks. \nANDY She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to her. If she's ready she'll stand for him, if not she won't. \nTAMARA That's disturbing human. \nANDY Refreshing basic. Darcy is up and at it. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 35. \nANDY (CONT'D) Thought you'd have gone back to London by now. \nTAMARA I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for a while. Actually, I've got a proposition for you. Andy glances at the goats; bad idea. \nANDY We should go for a drink sometime, Tam. You know, for old times sake. \nTAMARA So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose? \nANDY You didn't smash it. \nBETH As long as you're not working for her in the hours that I pay you. Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant. \nANDY Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38. \nHe walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and somehow slightly bereft. \n57 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN. 57 \nAndy comes in. He shouts into the house. \nANDY Tam? Got some colour charts for you to see. He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. \nTAMARA What would you choose for in here? \nANDY Well... I'd have this one. And then upstairs in the bedroom - \nTAMARA \nOK. She starts gathering her things. \nANDY So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here? \nTAMARA Make it. \n(SHE POINTS) Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge. \n(SHE GRINS) I'm off to work. Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away. \n58 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE. 58 \nPounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A security guard is already running towards them. \nJODY This is our village. Our fucking field. \nGUARD \nOUT! \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 39. \nJODY \nCOME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN! Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back. \n59 CUT. 59 \n60 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 60 \nBeth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched, breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She smiles. At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires. \n61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61 \nSwipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime. There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford. The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer, Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic. He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is getting more and more furious. In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods. Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate the boys. Ben takes a microphone. \nBEN Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no more. Steve Culley is a cunt. Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar. \nPUBLICIST Ben! Ben! What's happening? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40. \nBEN He's seeing Fran. I won't work with that tosser again. \nFRAN Steve! Don't! Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben. \nSTEVE You fucking baby. Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name. Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara. \nTAMARA Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe. \nBEN What? \nTAMARA I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time... \n62 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 62 \nJody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider. \nJODY They should let us in free. \nRYAN Too right. They come here, drink our water, use our fields, they leave all their crap in our drains - Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him. \nJODY Ben! Ben! She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving. \nCASEY What are you doing? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40A. \nJODY That was Ben from Swipe! Ben!! \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 41. \nJody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car. \nNicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass each other, each managing a painful smile. \nNICHOLAS How goes the opus? \nGLEN Fine Nicholas, just fine... Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen into deep anxiety. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 44. \n69 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 69 \nBeth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work. \nGLEN It's his most obscure novel `The Well- Beloved'. Most people have never even heard of it. About this guy of twenty who falls in love with a beautiful young woman. Then when he's forty, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her. And finally, when he's sixty he meets the \nGRANDDAUGHTER - \nBETH Oh he doesn't. \nGLEN Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy was like that in his life, too. Even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women. Like, in one essential way he never grew up. \nBETH In his trousers. \nGLEN He was still at it in his eighties. You know? Snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar... \nBETH Why won't it come for you Glen? The way you talk about it's so engaging. \nGLEN Yeah but there's an academic style, you know? \nBETH Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 45. \nGlen can't answer. \nBETH Because if you wrote the way you spoke... it would make me want to read Hardy. \nGLEN Really? \nBETH Yes. If you wrote like you were talking to a friend... Pass me that thing. Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt. \nBETH Try it now. Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused. \n69A CUT 69A \n70 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE DINING ROOM. 70 \nA cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass. \nNICHOLAS I simply pander to popular taste. \nCAITLIN Oh your books are far more than that. \nNICHOLAS Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich. \nCAITLIN Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity. \nGLEN Who did you base him on, Nicholas? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46. \nNICHOLAS \n(IGNORING GLEN) My books don't say anything profound. I can't pretend to be an intellectual - not like Glen here, illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow - but I do love prose. And I think I can turn a reasonable story. Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts. \nGLEN Excuse me. He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like cups around a teapot. \nGLEN Let me help. \nBETH They need dusting with this. \nGLEN I went to my room and I wrote for three hours. The time just vanished. \nBETH That's great, that's brilliant. \nGLEN I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool. \nBETH Super. Sprig of mint on the top. Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens to Nicholas as he serves them. \nNICHOLAS The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars... \nGLEN (as he serves Nicholas) `The basis of all excellence is truth.' Samuel Johnson. Glen's intellect wins the day. Nicholas smarts. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 46A. \n71 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 71 \nThe room - her mother's - is empty except for a mattress on the floor, clothes rail, designer bean bag and desk. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 47. \nTamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost pained with concentration. Ben is bored. \nBEN Are you done yet? \nTAMARA What's this? \nBEN What's it look like? \nTAMARA Ben... For which finger? \nBEN Whatever one you like. That's a nice one. Why not put it on that? He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 49A. \n79 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (LIMBURY). 79 \nPenny Upminister has managed to get Boss on a bit of rope. She is handing him over to Beth at the top of the field. \nPENNY Those girls could have aborted! \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50. \nBETH Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out. Nicholas is approaching. \nPENNY It beats me why you people want to live in the country. You've got no sense of responsibility. \nBETH It's not our dog! \nNICHOLAS Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy. \nPENNY Oh - Nicholas... \nNICHOLAS You're looking great. Terrific coat. \nPENNY What, this old thing? \nNICHOLAS You look like royalty. \nPENNY (laughs, delighted) Well, I try... Can't wait for your next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce- pot. Giles is always says `What are you reading Penny? You've got steam coming out of your ears...' She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding away with the dog, infuriated. \n80 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM 80 \nBen has put a ring on Tamara's finger. \nTAMARA So what's the ring saying, Ben? \nBEN It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will you marry me? Tamara looks at him, searchingly. \nBEN (CONT'D) What's up? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 50A. \nTAMARA I didn't know. \nBEN Didn't know what? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 51. \nTAMARA That you were in love with me. \nBEN The ring says I'm platinum with a long guarantee. So give me a reply. Tamara is grinning from ear to ear. \nTAMARA You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Can I say it then? \nBEN Say what? \nTAMARA I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings. \nBEN \n(ANSWERING IT) What? She's being proposed to. \n81 EXT. DAY. TEN MINUTES LATER. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 81 \nBen's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on. \nBETH Shhh! There are writers here, trying to write. Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms. \nBETH This is a Buff Orpington. She's looking a bit peaky today. Not a great layer but she's very decorative. Beth puts down the hen. \nBETH We're fully organic - but I like to think that our champion product is the written word. Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 52. \nNICHOLAS The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Ben just about manages to shake it. \nBEN Swipe's over. Thought the whole world knew that. \nNICHOLAS It wasn't on Newsnight, no. \nBETH Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely? He'd just popped the question when I rang. \nNICHOLAS She said yes? Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted. \nBETH We're delighted for you both. Boss leaps up, straining against a chain. \nBEN Why's he on a chain? \nCASEY Nice baby though. I'd like one that colour. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56. \nJody chucks her fag-end into the bin. \n87 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER - FIVE MINUTES LATER. 87 \nThe bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles. \nCASEY That Ryan... \nJODY What a dick. \nCASEY I think he's cute. \nJODY No you don't. Would you snog him? \nCASEY Maybe. \nJODY Be like having a slug in your mouth. Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades despite the gloom; Boss in the back. Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second. \nJODY (CONT'D) Ben! Ben! \nCASEY \nBEN!!! \nRYAN Wankers. Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars. \nJODY Come on. \n88 MERGED WITH 87. 88 \n89 EXT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM. 89 \nJody is outside the back door. She lifts a flowerpot and takes the key from underneath. \nJODY She keeps this here for Andy. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56A. \nCASEY What if she's got an alarm? \nJODY Soon find out. Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 57. \nCASEY What if they come back? \nJODY If you're too chicken, go home. The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes like a cat's. \n90 INT. NIGHT. HADDITON - A BOOK SHOP. 90 \nNicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd. \nNICHOLAS Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side. \nBETH What about you, Glen? Where will you be? \nGLEN In London with a collection of spare academics. I guess we'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way. \nBETH I'll miss our chats. \nGLEN I've been in a state of writerly bliss these last weeks. I hope I get to come back. \nBETH Me too. We'd love to have you. Glen doesn't want Beth to move away. \nGLEN (CONT'D) You know, this is the best mince pie I've ever had. \nBETH Oh? \nGLEN If it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food, this mince pie would do it. \nBETH \n(EMBARRASSED) Golly. She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 58. \nTamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in undisguised horror. \nBEN What the fuck are we doing here? \nTAMARA It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. They move through the crowd. \nVINTNER The 2001 was the best. Someone just bought my last three cases... \nPOSH HIPPY So I've got her this gorgeous Rajastani gagara skirt... Arriving at the mulled wine. \nTAMARA Besides, I want to show you off. \nBEN What am I - arm candy? \nTAMARA More like arm fungus with that face on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben, my fiance. \nBEN \n(DISGUSTED) Oh come off it. \nANDY What? \nBEN It's fucking alive. \nANDY Oh, you want it from Tesco, all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage. Ben's curiosity gets the better of him. \nBEN How d'you do it then? Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place by a metal frame. \nANDY Gently put it's head down there; then quick in the skull with an air rifle. Pluck it while it's warm, little pot to catch all the blood - \nBEN Do you enjoy doing that? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 61A. \nANDY No, but in my low wage economy, this flock's worth a lot. \nBEN You're a sick fuck, Andy. Andy has had enough. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62. \nANDY Grow up. \nBEN \n(SQUARING UP) What did you say? Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben. \nANDY I said grow up, little drummer boy. Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods. \nANDY Tamara rang me this morning. Said to finish the house. It goes on the market in the spring and that's it; over. \nGLEN Why does the asshole always get the girl? He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back. \nANDY Come on. Or you'll miss that train. \n94 INT. SIX WEEKS LATER. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 94 \nSnow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform. Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has been redecorated. \nJODY It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll be an event. I'll be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada. Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and... We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door frame, giving her a smouldering look. \nJODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all taut over his buff bod and underneath Calvin Klein Boxers, black. Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if he's found the love of his life. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 62A. \nJODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he'll have like one tattoo of my name and lush pecs and we'll have candles and white sheets and I'll smell of Allure by Chanel. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63. \nBen lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He bends down to kiss her. \nJODY (V.O.) (CONT'D) And he tries to stop himself but I'm a vision and he gets drawn into my power and it'll be like Uhhh... But also respectful. And my `V' plates will melt into nothing. She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC. \nJODY (CONT'D) Are you listening? \nCASEY I like this. \nJODY What? \nCASEY There's this bit right, where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it's some big treat but what he's doing, right, is telling her he's leaving them. And she, right, she's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate. \nJODY So? \nCASEY It's painful. But funny. It's about her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad, Jode. \nJODY Sad? She's a lucky cunt. \n94A EXT. NIGHT. WINNARD'S FARM 94A \nOutside the farm the snow falls. \n95 INT. DAY. LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 95 \nTamara is trying to write.

WINNARDS FARM 96 \nAndy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing has changed in a decade. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 63A. \nANDY So what about the shed? \nTAMARA (V.0) Hang on... \nANDY Am I dismantling it - or mending it? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 64. \n96A EXT.

She remains in the car, reluctant to go in, to face her isolation. She looks at herself in the mirror. The face that stares back seems like that of a stranger. \n109 DELETED 109 \n109A INT. A HOSPITAL. 109A \nTamara is lying in bed with her brand new nose bandaged up. He face is covered in bruising. She is panicking - experiencing a loss of self. \n109B EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109B \nThe mask drops. All her old insecurities come back. She gets out of the car and slams the door, unable to stand the sight of herself. She lets herself in. \n109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C \nThe inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm tones which bring out the beauty of the house. Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. She never knew the house was so beautiful. \n110 INT. DAY. EWEDOWN - JODY'S BEDROOM. 110 \nJody is weeping into her mobile phone. \nJODY I'll never see Ben again... And it's all MY FAULT.

Who's Ben? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 72A. \nJODY No one. \nMUM What've you done? \nJODY Nothing. \nMUM Are you in trouble? \nJODY NO!... Leave me alone. \nMUM You take care with boys, Jody. You know what can happen. \nJODY What can happen? What can ever, ever happen in a place like this? She throws herself on her duvet, inconsolable. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 73. \n111 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (MARVELL'S FARM). 111 \nBeth is with Lucetta, another writer, crossing a field. Lucetta raises her binoculars passes them to Beth. \nPOV SHOT AT MARVELL'S FARM. \nLUCETTA Are they crows or jackdaws? It's so nice to get these little details right. \nBETH They're rooks. \nLUCETTA I've got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide. \nBETH \n(THROUGH BINOCULARS) There's Nicholas... Nicholas's red scarf makes him visible from afar. \n112 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD AND COPSE. (LARKHAMS) 112 \nNicholas sees Tamara. He waits while she emerges from the copse. \nTAMARA I'm looking for Andy. \nNICHOLAS He's not up at Stonefield. Tamara is about to turn back. \nNICHOLAS So what about this shag I've been reading about? \nTAMARA Oh fuck off. \nNICHOLAS I liked your email. Very succint. \nTAMARA Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 73A. \nNICHOLAS I'll come round tomorrow then. About three? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 74. \nTAMARA Drop dead you smug prick. Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse. \n113 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. THE VILLAGE PUB. 113 \nTamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar, clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy kisses Zoe, long and tender. Tamara turns. She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare mutely as she drives away. \n114 INT. DAY. EWEDOWN. THE VILLAGE PUB. 114 \nJODY D'you think he's in with a chance? \nCASEY No way. \nJODY Why not? He's fit.

Tamara is troubled. \nNICHOLAS What's he doing here? \nTAMARA He just came on the off-chance. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 83A. \nNICHOLAS Off-chance of what? \nTAMARA He wants to know about roofing for the shed... \n129 EXT.

Tamara is peering out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves. \nJODY Oh. My. God. \nCASEY It's him. From Stonefield. \nJODY The dirty cheating sod. \n130 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 130 \nTamara wanders in looking like she's trying to shake Nicholas out of her hair. She sits, full of apprehension. We see her fears: Beth, in her apron, pulling Tamara's hair back and coming at her face with an electric hand-held whisk. \nBETH You fucking little slut. She puts her head in her hands. \n131 INT. EVENING. JODY'S BEDROOM. 131 \nJody and Casey have Googled Nicholas. They are outraged. \nCASEY `Prolific author of intelligent crime novels.' \nJODY Fucking `D' list. How could she do that after Ben? \nCASEY Maybe she's numbing the pain. \nJODY He's not even a proper celeb. \nCASEY Maybe older guys know more... you know, bed stuff. \nJODY Eww! He's a perv. I hate him. \nCASEY Jode, I know who I feel sorry for. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 84A. \n132 EXT. NEXT DAY. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 132 \nBeth is walking to the post box.

LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 143 \nBen is play-fighting with Boss. \nBEN (V.O.) And as it's a cute little brown girl with curly black hair I think we can safely say it's Steven Culley's and not mine. Truth is, I feel released. I am free! New band up and running. Done three songs about me and you. Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it. \nBEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Big favour to ask. We're recording in Paris. Would you have Boss? \n144 INT. DAY.

You're not sending it. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 89. \nJODY `Call Jody on 07700 900929.' Casey tries to stop her pressing send. Jody digs her nails into Casey's hand. Casey yowls. Jody presses send. \nCASEY You stupid cow! \nJODY I'm making something happen! \nCASEY You gone too far! \nJODY I'm getting him down here. \nCASEY / You don't know when to stop! You're an idiot. I'm not having nothing to do with it. Jody shouts over her from /. \nJODY Otherwise my whole life'll go by and I'll be washed up and thirty four like my mum and no one decent will ever even have snogged me!

She is suspicious. \nBETH I could come with you. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 89A. \nNICHOLAS Oh, don't. You hate festivals. \nBETH But it's only Hadditon. I'll come. \nNICHOLAS It's completely boring. You'll hate it. Stay here. Her suspicion will stay silent no longer. \nBETH Have you got anything to tell me, Nicholas? \nNICHOLAS Like what? Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence. \nNICHOLAS God, it's like living with the effing moral police. Are you ever going to trust me? He goes. \n145A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN (PIG FIELD). 145A \nNicholas drives through a huge puddle in his 4X4, splashing Casey. He roars on, oblivious. \nCASEY (getting her mobile out) Right.

Means you and I can start to think about our plans. For the future... \nTAMARA Nicholas?... \nNICHOLAS I know it's been hard, sharing me with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm going to leave her. I want a new life - and I want it now. With you. Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts. \nMINDER Mr Hardiment? It's time. \n154 CUT 154 \n155 INT. DAY. HADDITON - THE MARQUEE. 155 \nDuring the interview, Tamara takes a seat at the end of the front row. The audience listens attentively. \nNICHOLAS It all runs very smoothly. I start a book in the summer, publish it the following spring. Bit of a factory, really. \nINTERVIEWER So you've just finished `Like The Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth adventure. Are you already planning the next? \nNICHOLAS There won't be a next one. Frankly I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In fact, I'm about to kill him off. There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death has been announced. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 95. \nINTERVIEWER That's a bombshell for your fans. \nNICHOLAS (all for Tamara) Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures. \nLADY IN THE CROWD No! \nNICHOLAS Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to. \nLADY IN THE CROWD How could you? \nINTERVIEWER This might be a good moment to take a few questions. Yes, the lady in the apron... \nBETH You write a lot about adultery. Is that from personal experience? Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke. \nNICHOLAS Madam, what a saucy question! \nBETH Why do you cheat persistently on your wife? Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated. He decides not. \nNICHOLAS Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it. \n156 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE. 156 \nTamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame. Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up. \nCasey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone. Boss is running round and round it. \nCASEY Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben must be - Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of apprehension. \n159 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 159 \nBeth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing. \nBETH I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't do children. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 99A. \nShe is brandishing a diamond dagger award. \nBETH (CONT'D) He'll leave it all up to her. That'll age her. \nGLEN \nBETH - \nBETH But suppose he discovers fatherhood? \n(MORE) \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 100. \nBETH (CONT'D) They do, these men, second time round. They get all nappy-happy. I was barely twenty when I got pregnant. I've never done anything! Oh God! God! \nGLEN Yes you have. Look at this place! \nBETH I hate him - I've wasted my life! \nGLEN No... What about all the work you do here? \nBETH Breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits? It's meaningless! Beth bawls. Glen holds her. \nGLEN Beth... When I was lost with my book you helped me more than you know. You asked who I was writing it for... He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides. \nGLEN You. He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future opens up. She kisses him back. \nNICHOLAS Excuse me. Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) May I speak with my wife? Glen releases Beth. \nBETH No. You may not. She walks away. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 101. \n160 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 160 \nBeth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds. \nNICHOLAS It's over. \nBETH That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps he's come to beat the shit out of you - good! \nNICHOLAS Beth - I finished it. She's been chasing me; this wild crush - \nBETH \nLIAR - \nNICHOLAS There's something desperate about her, something almost unhinged - \nBETH Good God, even when you try and tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!! Nicholas is falling apart. \nBETH I want you to leave. I want a divorce. I want Stonefield. \nNICHOLAS Beth...Don't. You can't. \nBETH I will. \n(TO BOSS) And you - Go home! Bugger Off!! She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away. Beth storms off. Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just realised he's in danger of drowning. \n160A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 160A \nTamara's car pulls up outside. She gets out, looking at the yellow Porsche in complete disbelief. \nTAMARA Ben... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 101A. \n161 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 161 \nJody is shakily pouring a pot of tea. \nBEN Right. Now put two sugars in and stir it. OK. That's a decent cup. Which is lucky Jody cos if it had been shit, I'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now. \nJODY Please don't tell my mum. \nBEN I knew it was boring round here but for fuck's sake... \nJODY I'm gonna get out as soon as I can. Going to work in Vegas - as a croupier. Vegas, or a cruise liner. \nBEN Aim high, that's what I say. \nAndy gets out of his Landrover, takes out his rifle, comes through the gate. Loads his rifle while watching the dog. \n165B EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165B \nHis POV. The dog and the cattle. \n165C EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165C \nHe raises the gun. \n165D EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165D \nThrough his sights, the dog. \n165E EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165E \nAs his finger tightens on the trigger. Bang. A shot rings out. He looks round, off right. \n165F EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165F \nUp on the ridge of the hill, Penny Upminster is standing in a straw hat and flowery wellies, with a smoking gun. \nPENNY Got `im. The beast. \n166 CUT 166 \n167 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - BETH'S OFFICE. 167 \nBeth, chucking fan mail into the bin, stops in her tracks. \n167A EXT. DAY.

STONEFIELD - THE FIELD. 168C \nBeth is coming down the field where Nicholas lies. She sees a figure in the distance. She squints, the sun in her eyes. \n168D EXT. DAY. COPSE (LARKHAM'S) 168D \nOpposite her she sees Tamara descending through the copse. \n169 EXT. DAY. FIELD. (LARKHAMS) 169 \nTamara, walking down by the trough, discovers Nicholas' body. She drops to her knees, light-headed with shock. \n170 EXT. DAY. FIELD. 170 \nBeth walks into the field. She sees Tamara kneeling, looking at something on the other side of the trough. \nBETH Bitch. Tamara looks up. \nTAMARA Beth - no - \nBETH Brazen. That is brazen. Beth carries on walking towards her. \nTAMARA Beth. Don't. Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see. She throws her arms around her, protecting her. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Don't look. Don't look... It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it. Another great wave of shock. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 107. \nBETH Nicholas. No. Her cries of grief soar over the valley. \n171 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD - LATER. 171 \nTamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services. \nTAMARA You'll get to it through Byley farm. His skull is broken. It's smashed. No I haven't but... it's obvious. His wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough. \nTAMARA They're on their way... Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. She touches Beth's shoulder. \nTAMARA Beth? Help is coming - Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood. \nTAMARA It's broken! - She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away. \n171A EXT. DAY. IN THE COPSE. LATER. 171A \nTamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off her face. \nANDY Tamara... Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches. \nTAMARA I'm sorry. She starts crying bitter tears. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 107A. \nANDY Tam, come on. It was an accident. Still Tamara cries. He comforts her. She lets him. He holds her for some time. \n", "test1_input": "ZOE You're not staying with her? \nTAMARA She's. She died. Zoe finishes pouring the wine. \nZOE Have that on me. And here's your key. Up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it. Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning. We see why. Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint. \nZOE (CONT'D) Didn't think I'd see you tonight. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 16. \nANDY Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield. \nZOE Tell me everything... Andy shakes his head. \nANDY Marriage. Remind me never to try it. \nZOE Andy, you're just a sex object. No one'd have you. He grins back at her. \n24 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM 24 \nTamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose. Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not quite comfortable in her own skin. \n25 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 25 \nGlen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast. \nGLEN So the Hardiments have lived here centuries, huh? \nANDY No, `bout twenty years. Still strangers by local standards. Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard. \nBETH Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I think she's coming into heat. She goes out. \nGLEN She's a nice lady. \nANDY Yeah, I owe her a lot. \nGLEN Husband's a sleazebag, huh? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17. \nANDY We'd say prick here actually. Or wanker. \nGLEN That's good. We might even call him a Fuck. \nANDY That's good too. \n26 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE CHICKEN RUN. 26 \nAndy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife. \nBETH This is going rotten underneath. \nANDY Shall we look at Ingrid? \nBETH It's falling apart. \nANDY I can do that. Beth... Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears. \nANDY (CONT'D) He won't last five minutes. Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his support. \n26A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 26A \nGlen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs. \nGLEN (V.O.) I know why I'm drawn to Thomas Hardy. He writes about failure better than anyone else. I need this book to go well. I need a tiny reward for my endeavours... His stomach gurgles ominously. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 17A. \nGLEN (V.O.) I need a dump. \n27 DELETED. 27 \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18. \n28 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 28 \nGlen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief. \n29 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM. 29 \nGlen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in wonder. \nNICHOLAS (O.S.) If that's the way you feel... Nadia, I'm devastated. Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas. \nNICHOLAS (O.S.) But if that's your decision, I'll have to learn to live with it. Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end the call. For Beth's benefit: \nNICHOLAS (Into his phone) I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity. \nNICHOLAS Beth... \nBETH (CONT'D) No don't touch me, don't you dare. Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them - too late. \nNICHOLAS I'm sorry. \nBETH Not good enough. Not any more. \n", "test1_true": "BETH You do what you like and then you're sorry? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18A. \nNICHOLAS (O.S.) I hate myself. I hate myself. Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him. Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty. \nBETH Where were you? \nNICHOLAS Drove her back to London. Took all night. \nBETH You drove her home? \nNICHOLAS She was in a state. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 19. \nBETH Do you think she'll get over it?... Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry. \nNICHOLAS I'm sorry. Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms, holding each other. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) I don't know why I'm like this. I couldn't do without you. Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again. Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating. He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas releases Beth. She wipes her eyes. \nBETH I've got to go to the bottle bank. \nNICHOLAS OK... Let's talk later. \nBETH Yes. The goat's come into heat. \nNICHOLAS Has it? \nBETH I love you so much. \nNICHOLAS Me too. Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange. He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas' lies. \n30 DELETED 30 \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 20. \n31 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 31 \nGlen flops into a sun-lounger near Diggory. \nGLEN I've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up. \nDIGGORY \n(IRRITATED) The hat is on. \nGLEN Looks like she's taking him back. \nDIGGORY When the hat is on, it means don't speak. \nGLEN \n(WITH IRONY) So... Peace is restored. The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden. Diggory sits up, infuriated. \n32 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LIMBURY). 32 \nGlen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through. \nGLEN I don't like cows. I mean really. They exude bovine malice. \nANDY Yeah, these girls are killing machines. They don't like Americans either. \nGLEN Very funny. \n32A EXT. DAY. FIELD AND COPSE. (LARKHAM) 32A \nGlen and Andy are in the valley between the two farms. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21. \nANDY It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died a while back. Place is empty. \nGLEN You think it's being robbed? \nANDY Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do round here except make trouble. \nGLEN What if it's bad guys? Don't you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something? They climb up through a copse. \nCUT TO: \n32B EXT. DAY. FIELDS (WINNARDS). 32B \nGlen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards. \nANDY Used to belong to my dad, this place. \nGLEN Really? \nANDY But it all went tits-up. Land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to Londoners; the Drewes. \nGLEN So this is your ancestral pile? \n", "test1_id": 936, "test2_input": "JODY Contacts: where are you Ben? \nCASEY Look, there's that bloke my mum works for; Nicholas Hardiment. \nJODY Let's put him on.

Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL \nYOU STOP DRUMMING? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 68. \nHe stops. He looks at her, betrayed. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that email. \nBEN Explain it then. \nTAMARA Is this about Fran? \nBEN What's Fran got to do with it? \nTAMARA She's the reason you don't trust me.

The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops. \nTAMARA Can you go to the farm? Just take a look, see if anyone's been in. \nANDY No problem. \nTAMARA Thank you. Ben's really pissed off.

Going through your stuff, prob'ly wearing your fucking pants - \nTAMARA No way! \nBEN Bet it was him that nicked my black T-shirt. \nTAMARA There is no way Andy would do that!

I know Fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me. \nTAMARA Ben - where are you going? Don't go! \nBEN Fuck's sake. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70. \nHe pushes her away, harder than he meant to.

STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 106 \nPoppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is folding sheets. \nPOPPY Oh come on mum. She's just stirring shit. Tamara's always done that. \nBETH Why's your father on there - and poor Andy? It's so tasteless. \nPOPPY (helping with the sheets) You know how subversive she is. She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it. It's her sense of humour; she likes causing trouble. At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift. \nBETH She taught you to shoplift? \nPOPPY Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant. Why would she look at an old git like dad? Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest. Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table. Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious. \n106A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S SHED (LIMBURY). 106A \nNicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf. Andy is outside his shed, doing heavy work. \nNICHOLAS What did you make of that email from Tamara? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 70A. \nANDY It don't make any sense. Her London boyfriend's trying to fuck her up; that's my theory. Andy carries on working. \nANDY (CONT'D) She could do so much better. Nicholas walks on. \nNICHOLAS \n(TO HIMSELF) Couldn't agree more. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 71. \n107 EXT. DAY.

HADDITON - THE STATION / BETH'S CAR. 122 \nBeth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot. \nGLEN So after two years of radio silence I contact my editor.

An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to clean the window. \nGLEN Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers!

Nicholas is passing through, reading The Independent. \nNICHOLAS Geoff. \nGLEN Glen. \nNICHOLAS Henry James. \nGLEN Thomas Hardy. \nNICHOLAS That's right, a Hardy book. Coming well? \nGLEN Yes, actually. Nicholas returns to the paper. \nBETH He gave his wife syphilis. \nNICHOLAS Jolly good. He goes.

You lay yourself completely bare. \nTAMARA I'm well-known for it. \nNICHOLAS Seriously. It's very moving. Tamara knows this is praise indeed.

She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him. \nTAMARA Andy... Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive. \nJODY Bollocks. \nANDY Haven't seen you for a while. Thought you might be ill or something.

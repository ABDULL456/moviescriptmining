{"test1_input": "ANDY Was. Born in that room up there. He points up at the back bedroom window. \nGLEN You must have been pretty resentful. \n33 1995. EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE LANE. 33 \nAn eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse. \nANDY Hey. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A. \nThe girl turns. She has a huge nose. \nANDY This farm's mine, big nose. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22. \nThe girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air. \n34 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 34 \nAndy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house. Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box. \nANDY Hey, what're you doing? Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack. \nANDY (CONT'D) Who are you?? \nTAMARA Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition. \nANDY Tam?... Hardly recognise you. Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal. \nANDY (CONT'D) You won't do it that way. \nTAMARA Then help me! \n35 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 35 \nAndy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen. \nANDY Used to do bits of work for your mum. Been keeping an eye on the place since she died. \nTAMARA What sort of work, graphics? \nANDY I do horticulture now. \nTAMARA You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23. \nGLEN This is a great old house. \nTAMARA Would you like to buy it? \nGLEN I'm not really the property-owning kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand luggage. \nANDY That's why you're back, to flog it? \nTAMARA Yes. \nANDY Make a nice second home for some banker wankers. \nTAMARA Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer? \nANDY Because sadly I'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land. \nTAMARA Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. \nANDY Tam. Their eyes meet. \nANDY (CONT'D) What the fuck have you done to yourself? Tamara's face falls. \n36 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 36 \nGlen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding. \nANDY She's completely different. \nGLEN How was she before? What's the story?... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24. \nANDY There isn't one. \nGLEN Come on. \nANDY Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a teenage thing. \n37 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED. 37 \nTamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans. She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out of the way. They kiss passionately. \nANDY You should find someone you're in love with. \nTAMARA You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere. \n", "test1_true": "TAMARA You first. \nANDY You say it; You're the girl. \nTAMARA Fuck off. She kisses him. As they start to make love: \nTAMARA (CONT'D) I love you. Fuck off. I love you. \n37A EXT. DAY. A FIELD. 37A \nGlen looks over at Andy, interrupting his thoughts. \nGLEN Romeo and Juliet, huh? Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head. \n38 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 38 \nTamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow him curiously - then she firmly turns her back. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24A. \nTamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out. She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles. \n39 EXT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 39 \nBeth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with Nicholas at her side. \nBETH Thinking of the first time we saw this place... \nNICHOLAS You've made it a wonderful home Beth. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 25. \nBETH Not wonderful enough. She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back. \nNICHOLAS If you can't put this behind you, then we're stuck. \nBETH Well I'd better sort myself out then. \nNICHOLAS What has to happen? I am sorry - Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it; draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the depth of Beth's physical love for him. At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration. \nGLEN Just taking the air. Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the corner, Glen is cringing. \n40 CUT 40 \n41 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 41 \nJody and Casey are reading a celebrity magazine. \nJODY Would you do him? \nCASEY No. \nJODY What about him? \nCASEY He's gay, you dobbin. \nJODY So? They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe. \nCASEY Swipe. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 26. \nJODY Ben Sergeant... I'd walk through fire to do him. \nCASEY The drummer? \nJODY He's not just the drummer. He writes the lyrics; it's his band. He's the fucking genius, not Steve Culley or any of these wankers. It's Ben. \nCASEY OK. I'd do Ben. \nJODY I wanna be her, in that dress with him licking my teapot lids. \nCASEY Yeah... me too. \n42 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 42 \nCasey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents. \nDIGGORY People talk about the muscularity in prose. I want a similar muscularity in my verse. I don't want a poetry that's flabby or obese - that's why I adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen. \nDIGGORY ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the armature, the beating heart, the nerve ends... \nNICHOLAS So has the muse shone on you, Greg? \nGLEN I've been pretty distracted. Most recently by those delicious cookie things that Beth brought round this afternoon. \nNICHOLAS Oh yes. Of course we call them biscuits here. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 26A. \nGLEN And by the place itself, the people. \nNICHOLAS Sometimes wish I could get distracted. Ten page a day man, rain or shine. \n", "test1_id": 936, "test2_input": "GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 27. \nGLEN Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how do you do that? \nNICHOLAS Well, Greg - \nGLEN \nGLEN - \nNICHOLAS I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips. \nGLEN Matter of fact I read one of your books. Another distraction but I thought it was decent stuff. \nNICHOLAS Well. He's offended. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his breath, Glen impersonates: \nGLEN `We call them biscuits, here.' Nicholas raises his glass for a toast. \nNICHOLAS To the muse, however you find her. He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts, his glass still in the air. \nNICHOLAS (CONT'D) Who's that? Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28. \nGLEN That's Tamara Drewe. \nNICHOLAS No it isn't. \nGLEN I met her with Andy. \nNICHOLAS Good God. What's happened to her? \nPOPPY She's had a nose job, Dad. \nNICHOLAS She's completely different. \nGLEN That's what Andy said. \nBETH Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She used to come and help you wash the car, didn't she Nicholas? I think she liked a bit of family after her dad left. \nTESS Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays? \nBETH Used to. Writes for the Independent now. \nTESS She spent weeks going on about her nose job. Smart way to pay for it I suppose. Was her old one an awful conk? \nNICHOLAS Yes. \nBETH She's poured herself into those shorts. I hope they don't give her thrush. \nTESS What's the etiquette with nose jobs? Do we mention it, or... Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28A. \nTAMARA Hello. Sorry to intrude. Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards her, full of warmth. \nPOPPY Hey, Tamara. \nTAMARA Poppy, how are you? \nPOPPY Love your new hooter. \nTAMARA Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 29. \nAt last Beth remembers her manners. \nBETH Tamara, so sorry about your mum. \nTAMARA Thank you... \nBETH Are you staying down for a while? \nTAMARA I'll have to. There's so much to be done. \nBETH You must let us know if we can help. \nTAMARA Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and - \nBETH Nicholas? - Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word. \nGLEN I'm available. I do skips. \nDIGGORY I... No. \nTAMARA Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers. \nBETH Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons. \n43 EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 43 \nTamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts. \n", "test2_true": "44 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 44 \nBeth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening. \nBETH She's had the writers down there helping her all day. I hope she realises they're here to work... \nPOPPY Can't believe what a difference her nose makes. \nBETH Well I think it's a mistake; taken away all her character. \nPOPPY Come on; she looks ten times better. \nNICHOLAS Huh. \nBETH And she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating. Going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why? \nPOPPY To annoy people like you. Might get a pair myself. \nNICHOLAS Of course you won't. \nPOPPY Why not? \nNICHOLAS Because you're not desperate, are you? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe. Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on. \n45 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 45 \nTamara and Glen are having a rest. \nGLEN So why did you change your face? \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A. \nTAMARA Changing my face is the best thing I ever did. And I don't care what anyone thinks. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31. \nGLEN Would it work for me? \nTAMARA Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too. \nGLEN Oh, you're just coming on to me... Tamara laughs. She starts work again. \nGLEN In your column, you write about yourself... Does that come easily? \nTAMARA No... But it feels right. My first novel's definitely going to be autobiographical. \nGLEN Your first novel? You're going to dash one off just like that? \nTAMARA Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm thirty. \nGLEN And then maybe a swimwear collection, a chat show, a pasta sauce range? \nTAMARA What? \nGLEN Life sure is easy for the beautiful. \nTAMARA You know before I got the nose job I had no trouble getting taken seriously. Maybe, when they removed that bit of cartilage, they pulled my brain out by mistake - what do you think? Glen smiles, won over. \n46 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 46 \nGlen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half for himself. He has just been served by Zoe. \nGLEN She's single, man. Andy looks over at Zoe. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31A. \nANDY Well it's not exactly a relationship; we just have an occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want to be tied down and - \nGLEN Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get in there. Marry the girl. Then you get to live back in your ancestral home. \nANDY No way. Not her type. \nGLEN The trouble is Andy, you think like a loser. And I know that because I'm the loser that losers turn to for tips. I'm the losers loser. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 32. \nANDY I'm a pedigree loser. I had a graphics business; went bust. And then with my great business acumen I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja. \nGLEN Wow. How'd that go? \nANDY Made a tit of myself. Spent about six years stoned out of my box and I'm only just getting it back together. Besides, even if I was the last man in the world, Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me. \nGLEN Why not? \nANDY I dumped her. \nGLEN Oh, you are a loser. \nANDY I was twenty. My mates thought I was cradle snatching... And they used to call her Beaky. \n47 1996. EXT. DAY. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 47 \nTamara in her school uniform, is gutted. \n", "test2_id": 937, "test3_input": "BETH All my favourite teas - Oh! He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth. \nBETH My goodness. You feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after I've charged it up. You should go up to London more often. \nNICHOLAS Maybe I will... Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits. \nNICHOLAS Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig. Do carry on... \nLUCETTA I'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three, where the characters slowly turn into \nBIRDS - \nNICHOLAS That sounds very innovative... \nLUCETTA Do you think so? It's sort of the key to the structure, which I'm thinking of as a nest shape... \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 78. \nNicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes akin to suspicion. \n121 SPRING. POSY DRAWING. 121 \n122 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE STATION / BETH'S CAR. 122 \nBeth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot. \nGLEN So after two years of radio silence I contact my editor. And she loves - I mean loves the chapters I did in the fall. \nBETH Oh Glen. \nGLEN I tried writing at the library but I could feel that awful paralysis descending again. \n122A EXT. DAY. THE ROAD TO EWEDOWN / INSIDE BETH'S CAR. 122A \nGLEN (V.O.) I missed everything that I've been, you know, finding here. (Seeing the view) Oh my god - it's so beautiful! They are now in the village driving down the main drag. \nBETH I'm glad you've come back. \nGLEN A few solid weeks should - holy cow! An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to clean the window. \nGLEN Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's egg the self-regarding sacks of shit. \n123 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 123 \nGlen is helping Beth prepare the evening meal. They are both animated, enjoying one another's company. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 79. \nGLEN There's this theory he gave his wife syphilis, right? No evidence but the symptoms fit. The poor woman gets kind of eccentric and moves her bed up to their attic - \nBETH The bastard - \nGLEN Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him. \nBETH I don't believe it. Nicholas is passing through, reading The Independent. \nNICHOLAS Geoff. \nGLEN Glen. \nNICHOLAS Henry James. \nGLEN Thomas Hardy. \nNICHOLAS That's right, a Hardy book. Coming well? \nGLEN Yes, actually. Nicholas returns to the paper. \nBETH He gave his wife syphilis. \nNICHOLAS Jolly good. He goes. Beth is ashamed of his condescension. \nBETH He's completely distracted. He's up and down to London all the time. The latest Inchcombe's taking everything he's got. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 80. \n124 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 124 \nNicholas is reading, hunched over a computer. He glances round. Tamara, wearing a robe, is awaiting his opinion. \nTAMARA Is it any good? Because I keep - \nNICHOLAS Shush. (Points at the screen) This is brutally candid. You lay yourself completely bare. \nTAMARA I'm well-known for it. \nNICHOLAS Seriously. It's very moving. Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified. \nTAMARA Thank you. \nNICHOLAS So... have I done my duty? \nTAMARA Admirably. \nNICHOLAS Now do I get my treat? Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen. \n", "test3_true": "125 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. BUS SHELTER. 125 \nJody and Casey share a magazine and a spliff in the bus stop. \nJODY Zero Ben sightings in two whole months. \nCASEY Last time I saw Plastic she looked like a minger; all red-eyed and gutted. Ben's a Love Rat. \n(MORE) \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 81. \nCASEY (CONT'D) She should move on... \nJODY She's probably topped herself. I would if Ben dumped me. \nCASEY Jode. Don't say that. What if she's done something? \nJODY Like got in the bath with her heated tongs? \nCASEY Like taken a stack of pills? We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her mouth coated with dried froth and vomit. \nJODY D'you think she might be lying there all choked in vomit and drug froth? \nCASEY That'd be dire. \nJODY If we find her we'll get in the papers. \nCASEY Oh my God. \nJODY Rock Chick Dead at Winnards Farm. \n125A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS. DAY 125A \nAndy is outside the farm beside his landrover. He walks up to the front door. Hesitates. Behind the railings, the girls arrive. \nCASEY What's Uncle Andy doing here? Andy knocks. \n126 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 126 \nHearing the knock, Tamara springs out of bed. Nicholas spins into a panic. \nNICHOLAS Arse biscuits. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 81A. \n126A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 126A \nCasey and Jody are watching as Andy waits. \nCASEY No answer... \nJODY She could have been lying there days. She could be like putrid now, like rancid - \nCASEY Oh no, I'm gonna chuck - \nJODY Like bloated and all greeny. \nCASEY And Uncle Andy'll find her by the smell! \nBOTH Eurrrrr! Shhhhh!! \n(MORE) \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 82. \nBOTH (CONT'D) \n127 I/E. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 127 Tamara opens the door in some deshabille. To her surprise, she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him. \nTAMARA Andy... Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive. \nJODY Bollocks. \nANDY Haven't seen you for a while. Thought you might be ill or something. Or depressed or - \nTAMARA I've had my head down, writing. \nGOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 83. \nANDY Come for a drink. Let's lighten up. \nTAMARA I'd love to, but... \nANDY Shake off the winter blues. Come celebrate the spring. \nTAMARA I can't... I'm kind of on one with my writing. Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is unaware that he has seen. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Can we do it soon though? I'd really like to; just not right now. He nods at her in disbelief. \nANDY \n(COOLLY) Sure. He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door. Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened. \n", "test3_id": 938}

LETTY I think I could get the program up and running in the next two weeks. 
JOHANSEN From what I understand the principal has removed you from student activities. 
LETTY She's worried that I'm unstable. 
Johansen studies her. 
LETTY But I wouldn't push for the program if I wasn't ready. 
JOHANSEN What about the office work? 
LETTY I'd have to do that, too. But I've gotten better at pacing myself. 
JOHANSEN Are you sure? 
LETTY I'll call you if I have problems. Scout's honor. 
JOHANSEN I have to say I'm inclined to give it another try. 
Letty hugs Johansen. 
JOHANSEN But, Letty, why don't you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time? 
INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Michael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About half of the application is now completed. 
INT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT 
Letty and her mother sit in silence. Letty smiles at her mother. Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back. 
Michael hurries in. 
MICHAEL Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer. 
LETTY I got worried. Are you OK? 
Michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts it on.               M ICHAEL How may I help you? 
LETTY Congratulations. 
MRS. MAYER Michael, the shop's about to close. Maybe you could try on your tux. 
Michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store. 
LETTY (to Mrs. Mayer) Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him? 
MRS. MAYER I will, Dear. I promise. (beat) Why McDonald's? 
LETTY He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away. 
Letty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks at her. Letty ignores her mother. 
MRS. MAYER I've read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald's and Burger King. 
Letty looks at her mother, tries to read her. 
LETTY I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded. 
MRS. MAYER Don't be fresh. 
LETTY Just remember that I love him. 
Michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears. 
Letty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at the dashing Michael. 
MRS. MAYER (to Letty) I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn good in a tuxedo. 
EXT. TRACK - DAY 
Letty and Michael jog. 
MICHAEL Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin? 
LETTY No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker. 
MICHAEL Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic? 
LETTY You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head around as "Pachelbel's Canon" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL L advances. 
Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession, heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight. 
But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands. Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty.

FADE IN: 
EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY 
RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd. 
RICK Helluva talent, that kid. 
John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone call. 
RICK Probably be in the bigs in another year. 
John nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue uninterrupted. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE 
MELANIE SIMMERS, twenty-four, scurries around a sparse, but neatly adorned house getting dressed. 
MELANIE Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can't be late again. 
CUT TO: INT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - ZACH'S BEDROOM 
ZACH SIMMERS, six, sits on his bed in pajamas. 
ZACH I'm ready. 
Melanie ENTERS. 
MELANIE Come on baby. Don't do this to mommy. Not today. 
ZACH I don't want to go. Melanie hastily dresses her son. 
MELANIE Zach, do you want mommy to get fired? 
ZACH Yes. 
MELANIE If I get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself. CUT TO: 
EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY 
John still talks on his cell. 
RICK Must be something to have that kind of talent. He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago. 
John ends his call and turns back to Rick. 
JOHN You. 
RICK Huh? JOHN Guys like you... 
RICK And me... 
JOHN ... squandered opportunities. I, on the other hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had the talent. 
RICK You knew where you were going? 
JOHN Absolutely. 
RICK At nineteen? 
JOHN Without question. 
RICK The only thing I knew for certain was that I would run to the corner store every day for beer. 
CUT TO: EXT. DAIRY MART - DAY 
Melanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off.

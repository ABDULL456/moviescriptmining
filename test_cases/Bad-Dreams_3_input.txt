We FOLLOW the young nurse as she goes into-- 
16   CYNTHIA'S ROOM                                                  16 Bored, the nurse goes to the foot of the bad, checks the chart there. She moves past MONITORING EQUIPMENT which shows only subtle movement. As she begins to take Cynthia's blood pressure, CAMERA CONTINUES ON INTO THE BED and we see Cynthia, 
She is now a fully grown young woman in her late 20's.   She is curled up in a fetal ball. 
17   THE YOUNG NURSE                                                 17 finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side table. She goes to the door and then REACTS to a SOUND. 
She looks around, puzzled. Meanwhile, we SEE (and she DOESN'T) that there is INCREASED ACTIVITY on the monitors. 
CYNTHIA (faint, weak) No... no... it's wrong... someone... please help... 
YOUNG NURSE Holy shit... 
Stunned, the nurse DROPS the bottles with a CRASH. Recovering her composure, she darts back to the bed, watches flabbergasted as Cynthia continues to STIR, her arms weakly battling half-realized fears. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: The young nurse hits an ALARM, grabs Cynthia's arms to prevent her from pitching out of the bed, and then DOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling all over the room, and as the DIN RISES we

18   INT. HOSPITAL PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY                                18 FLASHBULBS pop and the HOSPITAL SPOKESMAN grins clumsily, famous for fifteen minutes. 
There's eight or nine reporters here, all of them wishing they were on bigger stories. 
SPOKESMAN (in mid speech) Twelve years, two months...   nine days. 
FIRST REPORTER Is that like a world record for a coma or something? 
SPOKESMAN Actually, no. The longest one on record is 37 years. 
The first reporter closes a notebook, leaves. 
SECOND REPORTER Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House? 
19   NEW ANGLE - SHOWING THE BACK OF THE ROOM                            19 Lieutenant (n√©e Inspector) Wasserman is there.    He's grayer, paunchier, but the raincoat is the same one. 
SPOKESMAN'S VOICE (correcting) Unity House. No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it. It's not uncommon after serious trauma. 
THIRD REPORTER What happens to her now? Have her family or friends been notified? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
SPOKESMAN We stopped looking for any family ton years ago.. Right now we"re planning to transfer Cynthia to Dr. S.A. Berrisford's Neuropsychiatric Clinic. It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you. 
The reporters filter out. 
Wasserman is already gone.

20   FOOT                                                                  20 as it is clumsily set down...    another FOOT slides forward. 
21   INT. THERAPY ROOM - WIDER                                             21 Cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars. She's pale, weak looking. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST is at her elbow, egging her on. 
THERAPIST Good... Very good... Come on, just a few more steps... 
Cynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word takes some adjustment. 
CYNTHIA (weary) I... I can't... I have to rest... 
BERRISFORD'S VOICE Young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest. 
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show DR. BERRISFORD. In his 50's, avuncular, he wears half-framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat. Two pieces of tissue paper mark his razor's passage on his neck. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
BERRISFORD (CONT'D) Now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream. 
Something about Berrisford's mock-stern tone bores in on Cynthia, gets a reaction. She gropes for an answer. 
CYNTHIA (finally) I... I hate chocolate ice cream. 
BERRISFORD Then walk to the end of the platform, or I'll shove an entire gallon down your throat. 
Cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform. The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair. 
BERRISFORD (to the therapist) That'll be all. 
Berrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia.

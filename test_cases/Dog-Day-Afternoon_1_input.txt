The cops, safely distanced and back in cover, peek out at: 
BANK DOOR 
It is okay. 
RADIO NETWORK (V.O.) What's happening?  He shot through the door.  Is he coming out?  Can you see in... (Etc., etc.) 
ON MORETTI 
reaches out his hand for a bullhorn that is thrust into it immediately. 
MORETTI (on bullhorn) Sonny! 
A few louts in the crowd yell out in imitation: 
LOUTS Sonny! 
MORETTI Sonny! 
CROWD (echoing) Sonny! 
Moretti shrugs off his irritation and raises the bullhorn one more time: the crowd is ready and SCREAMS in unison as Moretti says: 
MORETTI & CROWD Sonny! 
You could hear it for a half a mile! 
Sonny starts to yell at Moretti. 
SONNY (inside bank) What the hell you doin' back there? 
MORETTI Sonny, come on out! 
Sonny walks over to Sal, gives him the rifle. 
SONNY Sal, watch 'em... I'm goin' out. 
ANGLE ON BANK 
as Sonny comes charging out. 
SONNY What the fuck do you want? 
MORETTI They were... 
SONNY You tryin' to fuck me? 
MORETTI No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you. 
SONNY So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there? 
MORETTI I swear to God I had nothing to do with it... 
SONNY Bullshit... I don't walk to talk to you... 
MORETTI Wait a minute... everything you asked for is on the way... 
SONNY Yeah... 
MORETTI Is on its way... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus... the jet's on its way to Kennedy... we got a bus coming here... 
SONNY You're full of shit... 
MORETTI Sonny, your wife's on the way...  We reached her... your wife's on the way... everything you asked for, you got. 
SONNY Well, what were you doin' back there? 
MORETTI It can't happen again... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can... 
SONNY You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here... 
MORETTI Can't land... you'd kill people... 
SONNY Don't fuck with me... 
MORETTI I'm not... I'm not... you're gettin' a bus... you're gettin' a bus... the jet's comin' into Kennedy... and your wife's on the way... what else do you need?  What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better...  see that man over there... the FBI guy... 
SONNY Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body... 
MORETTI There won't be... there won't be... What else do you need?  How else can we help you? 
SONNY All right... I got some hungry people in there... I want to get some pizza... some stuff like that... 
MORETTI What else? 
SONNY Cokes, seven-ups... (Moretti repeats) also some aspirin... 
MORETTI Aspirins... okay you got it. (turns behind him to a near-by cop) Charlie!  Six pizzas! 
SONNY Okay...

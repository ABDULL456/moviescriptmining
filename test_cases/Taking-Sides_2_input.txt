GREEN We can't drop a case just like that. 
DYMSHITZ I'll give you another conductor in exchange or writer, musician, actor what...what do you care?  But I like Furtw√§ngler. He's my favourite conductor. (chuckles.) Mine and Hitler's. He's our favourite conductor. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Rode is seated, waiting. Nervous, tense. The sound of laughter, David's laughter from the office. It makes him even more uncomfortable. 
INT. STEVE'S OFFICE SUITE - DAY 
Emmi and David laughing. 
DAVID I clicked my heels, saluted and bowed at the same time. 
He demonstrates. She laughs again. 
EMMI That's because you had a proper upbringing. 
DAVID That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to! 
EMMI Oh! And don't wave your hands about! 
DAVID Respect your elders and your betters! 
EMMI And no elbows on the table! 
DAVID Eating is eating... and... 
EMMI And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on. 
DAVID Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares. 
She smiles just as Steve bursts in. He's in a bright, cheerful, energetic mood. 
David draws back guiltily. Emmi, embarrassed, hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously. Seeing this, Steve stops, but just for a brief moment. Then, as he goes to his desk: 
STEVE David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive? 
DAVID Yes. 
STEVE So what is it? 
DAVID The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive. 
STEVE What's that mean?

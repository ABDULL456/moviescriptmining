DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT \nNight is falling in a forgotten part of the city. \nThe street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead. Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street. \nOnce the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied. \nAt various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can fires. \nANGLE ON TWO BUMS \n- as their eyes move, following something moving down the street.  Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful engine. \nANGLE ON STREET \nDown this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is going shopping. \nThe car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block. \nANGLE ON STORE \nA dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS. \nANGLE ON CAR \nThe side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out. \nJP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather jacket. \nFor a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life. Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through the doorway. \nINT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT \nThe store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended. \nIt is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through. \nThe stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata, wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room? \nANGLE ON JP \nHe wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner suggests he is looking for something specific. \nNear the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it. \nANGLE ON HOARDING \n- which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters: \nYOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE! AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND MENAGERIST. \nANGLE ON JP \n- as he moves the hoarding aside. \nJP Wow ... \nREVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black finish as the pillar itself.  The pillar is extremely bizarre, as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats, copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces. \nOne of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first two HELLRAISER pictures. \nANGLE ON JP \n- as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom. \nJOEY I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me. \nDOC Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ? \nDoc is interrupted by the RINGING of a cell-phone he has holstered at his waist.  He picks it up. \nDOC Speak. \nCELLPHONE Doc.  24th and Cedar.  Fast.  Hostage situation. \nDOC OK.  Listen - Joey's here.  Shall ... \nCELLPHONE No need.  Martin's already there. Hurry.  You've got ambulances to beat. \nThe line goes dead.  Doc looks at Joey.  She heard it all.  He shrugs apologetically. \nJOEY Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter. \nDOC Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place. \nJOEY You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go. \nDOC OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner. \nJOEY That is the story of my life. \nWith a rueful smile, Joey watches Doc leave. \nJoey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joey's impassive but vaguely friendly, the Nurse's a little disapproving; if the camera's gone, what the hell are YOU still doing here? \nINT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT \nJoey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set giving on to the ER, the other toward an exit.  Joey is heading for the latter, her mood sad and defeated. \nANGLE ON EXIT DOORS \nSuddenly - SMASH! - the doors burst open from the other side. \nANGLE ON CORRIDOR \nThe mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors. \nTwo PARAMEDICS, both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other.  They completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who is running beside the gurney. \nThe girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19.  She is a pale-faced blonde dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses. \nAs Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her attention.  It is the BOY on the gurney. \nANGLE ON GURNEY/BOY \nThe teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow. \nHorribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long, heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor. There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin. \nANGLE ON CORRIDOR \nThe DIALOGUE as the gurney is rushed to the ER doors is RAPID- FIRE and OVERLAPPED, the Paramedics responding only to each other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions. \nTERRI It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault. \nPARAMEDIC 1 10 milligram IV Valium stat.  How the fuck did this happen ... ?! \nTERRI It was outside.  I wasn't even with him. \nPARAMEDIC 2 You ever see anything like this before? \nTERRI He must have stolen it. \nJOEY What's going on? \nPARAMEDIC 1 Yeah, sure.  Five times a fucking day. Just push! \nOnce the gurney has passed her, Joey runs along behind it. \nTERRI It was off the statue.  In the club. \nThe lights in the room flicker and strobe. \nThe fibrillator pads arc angrily. The Doctor flings them away. \nELECTRIC ENERGY seems to run along the slumped chains and they disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown. \nLighting and machinery return to normal (ECG still flat-lining) and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy. \nFor the first time, the other people in the ER become aware of Joey's presence in the doorway. \nDOCTOR Who's that?  Get her out of here! \nThe Nurse heads for the doors.  Joey is already backing away. \nANGLE THROUGH DOORS INTO CORRIDOR \n- as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her face.  The doors close over, blocking her out. \nANGLE ON FIBRILLATOR PADS \n- still arcing. \nCROSS-FADE TO \nINT.   CROSS-TOWN BUS    NIGHT \nCLOSE on flickering neon light in the bus cabin. \nANGLE ON JOEY \n- glancing at the light from her seat. \nJOEY'S POV - VARIOUS ANGLES \nThe bus is almost deserted.  Three other passengers - A PUNK, A BAG LADY, and A WINO - are spread out around the interior.  All seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated stares highlight Joey's isolation and tension.  Fear has entered her life. \nThe bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown streets. \nANGLE ON JOEY \n- her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is lost and distant, as if she is submerged in some dream-sea of memory and sadness. \nINT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   DAY \nA wall of TV monitors, each monitor showing Joey sitting on a couch with a painfully thin older woman - BRITTANY VERTUE. \nBrittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as surgery can make it.  She is dressed in the standard uniform of the health-avatar; brightly-colored leotard over black tights. \nJoey has a big paperback book - BEYOND HUNGER; THE BRITTANY VERTUE GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DIETING - which she holds to camera. She smiles and, turning to face Brittany, crosses her legs. \nThe image freezes.  And replays.  Joey crosses her legs again. And again.  And again. \nBRAD (over) See?  This is what I mean.  Your technique is all wrong. \nCUT TO WIDE \nJoey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the editing suite looking at the wall of monitors. \nBRAD, a techie in his late-twenties, and DOC FISHER are in swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console. \nAll three are drinking coffee.  Doc is smoking a cigarette. \nJOEY (guardedly) What do you mean? \nBRAD I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made. \nDoc chuckles in a half-friendly, half-sleazy way. \nJOEY Fuck you. \nBRAD What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman. \nJOEY (to herself) Jesus Christ ... \nDOC Ah, give her a break. \nTWO BIMBOS \n- giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads. \nJOEY \n- catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance floor and pushes through the crowd to follow.  She taps the figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man \u0096 some 70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER.  He looks quizzically at her. \nJoey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some response.  The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name. \nJoey can't hear him.  She hands him a business card and a pen. \nHe scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her thanks as he moves on. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON CARD \n- as Joey reads the name \"Terri\" on it.  She flips the card to reveal her name and number and writes \"Terri - Please call!\". \nANGLE ON BAR \n- as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a BARMAN who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter. \nANGLE ON EXIT \n- as Joey makes her way out. \nANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR \nCamera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor, making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center. \nThe crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence. \nThe pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele dance around it.  It seems very in keeping with the decor of the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence. \nThe pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even odder than our first glimpse of it.  Near the bottom the inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen. \nThe camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image. \nAs this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a whirring, spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we \nCUT TO \nEXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM) \nThe screen is filled with dense jungle foliage. \nThe chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of Helicopter blades, one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying the sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries. \nA POV camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery. \nThe camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside. \nVoices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-screen as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal. \nSOLDIER 1 (off) Call for a Medi-Vac! \nSOLDIER 2 (off) Don't die, man!  Don't fucking die! \nThe dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the POV camera.  Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage, it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead. \nIn a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over the prone body of a third.  It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform. \nA new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic, ringing sound.  The other elements die away until only this is left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we \nCUT TO \nINT.   BEDROOM, JOEY'S APARTMENT   NIGHT \nJoey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues.  Confused and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening. \nFinally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside table to pick it up. \nANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE \n- favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the phone.  Its warm green figures show the time is 2:35. \nShe hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her. \nJOEY ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is. \nTERRI What is it? \nJOEY Why are you so interested? \nTERRI Sorry. \nJOEY No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father. \nTERRI (sympathetic, knowing) Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ? \nJOEY God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out. \nTERRI That's great. \nJOEY What? \nTERRI No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean? \nJOEY I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them. \nTERRI Whatever.  All I know is - this is it for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to see something else.  Have a nighttime life.  Be somebody different. \nTerri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something. \nTERRI Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just girls talking.  Like having a conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a cigarette? \nJoey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured but marginally strung-out personality.  She looks around the room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes. \nJOEY Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a minute. \nJoey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind a shelf of videos.  We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT WAR, volumes 1 thru 26.  She brings the smokes to Terri. \nTERRI Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one? \nJOEY I'm trying to quit. \nTERRI Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever? \nShe smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles, and takes one.  Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.  Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes the lid extinguishing the flame.  Terri draws a book of matches from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette. \nJOEY Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental. \nTERRI It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once. \nJoey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights both cigarettes.  Terri takes a long, fearful look at the burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her cigarette. \nTERRI Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see it is ... you give up, right?  Three days later, you get hit by a fucking truck and you know - you just KNOW \u0096 that your last thought as you go under those wheels'd be \"Jesus H. Christ, I coulda smoked another three packs!\" \nShe lays the book of matches down.  Joey's eyes go to them. \nANGLE ON MATCHES \nBlack letters on the dark-grey cover: UNDER THE UNDERGROUND. \nANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI \nTerri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes, becoming subdued and a little sullen. \nTERRI Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff. \nJOEY Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was. \nTERRI But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ... \nJOEY Did you know him? \nTERRI No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue. \nJOEY Taken what? \nTERRI The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it \n- as JP's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and pain.  A rat is hanging on to one of JP's fingers, its sharp teeth buried in the flesh! \nJP swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat with the force of his swing.  A spray of blood is seen to come from JP's wounded finger. \nANGLE ON RAT \n- as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously. \nANGLE ON JP \n- as he looks down at his finger, face snarling. \nJP Son of a ... \nANGLE ON FINGER \nVERY CLOSE.  Blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks. \nJP (off) ... bi ... \nJP's voice is cut off by a strange SIZZLING NOISE heard OFF. \nJP's face moves up to look at the pillar.  A look of awe and shock crosses his face. \nANGLE ON PILLAR \nSome small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness of the pillar.  The sizzling noise is coming from them. \nSuddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby of blood - already larger than possibility would allow.  Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar. \nThe streams of blood don't simply fall straight.  They seem to follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing the blackened organic contours of the carvings. \nThey all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features. \nWhen every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with blood, a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he had enjoyed in (un)life. \nANGLE ON JP \nCLOSE on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue light. \nANGLE ON PINHEAD \n- as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood vanishing with it, leaving the same frozen implacable blackness as before but charged now with a waiting power. \nFADE TO BLACK \nINT.   KITCHEN, JOEY'S APT.   DAY      (NEXT MORNING) \nBLACKNESS \nJOEY (off) Oh my God ... \nCLOSE ON STOVE TOP \nA frying pan sits atop a burner.  it contains the ugliest mess of scrambled eggs you have ever seen ... or perhaps it's an omelette.  There are other ingredients in there but they're burnt so black they're unrecognizable.  At least half of the mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan. \nJOEY (off) Did I sleep through an earthquake? \nVARIOUS ANGLES \n- showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on work surfaces; Egg-shells on the linoleum; A knocked-over glass of orange juice, the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen roll; Coffee as black and thick as a mix of Indian ink and molasses. \nCUT TO WIDE \nJoey, in her dressing-gown, stands in the doorway with a shocked expression on her face. \nTerri, in an oversized man's shirt, stands by the stove holding a fish-slice and smiling nervously. \nTERRI I figured I'd make breakfast. \nJOEY Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory? \nTERRI Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me. \nJoey nods slowly, crossing to a cabinet and taking out some instant coffee. \nTerri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for somewhere to put them.  All the shelves are full.  She lays them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at the shelves, grabbing up the second folder. \nTERRI What am I looking for? \nJOEY God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues. \nTerri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she flicks through the contents. \nTERRI Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this shit?  It's like fucking business papers for God's sake! \nBored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit. \nANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER \n- as she flicks through the contents. \nTerri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE. \nJoey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws the contents out and begins to sift through them. \nThe first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the dust from the photo. \nLOW ANGLE - ON BOX \n- which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust from the photo settling next to it. \nON JOEY \nThe next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says COTTON, KIRSTY  CASE NO.  5719. \nON BOX \nThe sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF and then FADES as something strange begins to happen. \nSuddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or is the box itself glowing and shining? \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE \n- as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ... \nJoey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what she is seeing ... \nThe next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of what appears to be an ancient document. \nIt is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan.  And it is of the box seen from various angles. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE \n- as she realizes what she is looking at. \nJOEY (softly) Alright ... \nJoey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and compare it to the diagram. \nJoey gasps. \nThe miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it. \nAs if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud as the last particle of dust disappears into the box. \nJoey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand. The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit. \nTerri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey. \nTERRI Joey ... ? \nJOEY (still staring at Box) Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale. \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   EARLY EVENING \nJoey is sitting behind a desk.  She has a phone in one hand and a pen in the other. \nSpread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc - and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers. \nJoey is in mid-conversation on the phone. \nANGLE ON JP \nStill staring at the ceiling, JP pulls a pained face - like he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times. \nSANDY Don't you think? \nJP Mmn-hmnn. \nSandy turns to look at JP, troubled by his unresponsiveness. \nSANDY Do you mind me talking about your stuff? \nJP Unh-unh. \nA beat.  Sandy stares at JP.  JP stares at the ceiling. \nSANDY If it bothers you, just say so. \nJP sighs. \nJP It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested. \nSANDY Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person. \nJP blows a smoke ring at the ceiling. \nSandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the bed.  ( And yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract audience attention.) \nSANDY But you gave me a rose ... \nJP And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out. \nSANDY You shit.  Who do you think you are? \nJP I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life. \nSANDY You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ... \nJP Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something. \nSANDY Look at you!  You think you're some God damn Prince or something.  With your shitty little Kingdom out there and all this ugly shi .... \nSandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar. \nSuddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms. \nThe BLUE LIGHT burns from within, illuminating Pinhead's face as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger. \nAn impossible WIND begins to whistle through the room, as if an echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell. \nSandy screams in mortal terror. \nJP jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor.  He backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless. \nJP Jesus Christ! \nPinhead smiles sardonically. \nPINHEAD Not quite. \nPinhead's arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his face, stifling her scream. \nJP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: \nSandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar. Into Pinhead. \nIt is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds - \nHer body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and lifeless.  It is made worse by the fact that until the very end Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster. \nThe wind keeps blowing through the room. \nFinally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor. \nThe Blue Light fades from within the pillar. The wind disappears. \nA massive BLAST resounds around the room but that's about it; the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar. \nPINHEAD Thank you.  Now, shall we talk sensibly? \nJP lets the useless gun fall from his hand. \nPINHEAD Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse... \nJP What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you? \nPINHEAD Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you. \nIt's working.  JP's eyes are glittering with excited interest. \nJP What are you? \nPINHEAD A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire. \nJP Hey, that's what makes the world go round. \nPinhead raises an amused eyebrow at JP's little joke. \nPINHEAD You see, we're not so dissimilar. \nJP But how in God's name ... \nPINHEAD God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes. \nJP cruises the room, contemplating this. \nJP How do we start? \nPINHEAD It has already begun. \nINT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT \nANGLE ON MONITORS \nMany screens fill the frame, all of them crackling with snow. \nCUT TO WIDE \nJoey is alone at the control desk.  She has a video tape in her hand and feeds it into the master machine. \nShe looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses a few buttons on the console. \nThe snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time code ticking away at the bottom of each screen. \nJOEY (softly) Alright ... Let's see what we got here. \nThe blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of KIRSTY, the girl in the picture in the antique store. \nThe video image is primitive, shot with a non-professional camcorder, and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty, dressed in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room. \nKirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor. \nINTERCUT through Kirsty's monologue between: A single monitor image, the wall of monitors, and the watching and listening Joey. \nKIRSTY (on video) I don't know what the Box is.  But I know what it does.  I ...    (looks up to side)     I've said all this before. Do you ...    (blinks, nods, as if listening.  Looks back to camera)  I saw it open.  I opened it.  I saw what came out.  I don't know what else to call them.  Demons.  Demons live in the box. Or come through the box from somewhere else.  It's a gateway to Hell.  Or the South Bronx.     (smiles ruefully at her own joke.  Looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around.  Nods. Continues)     I know you don't believe me.  I know what it sounds like.  But what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson, talk to the other cops.  They saw the house.  They saw my ... my father ... \nKirsty breaks down into sobs. \nQUICK-CUT TO JOEY \n- whose expression shows distressed sympathy.  She too has lost her father. \nANGLE ON MONITORS \nThe video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back in, as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments. \nWhen the image returns, Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help calm her. \nKIRSTY (on video) Solving the puzzle means opening the box.  Opening the box means opening doors.  And there are some doors you don't want to open.  And it may be metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you haven't had some blue-faced bastard come at you with hooks and chains.  It isn't delusion, it isn't psychosis.  It's reality.  It's reality.     (Pause. Long drag on the cigarette?)   Maybe not this reality ... but there are others. I've seen them. \nJoey's face shows horrified fascination at Kirsty's story. There is a conviction in the telling which is working on Joey. \nTERRI I miss you too. \nJP That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone? \nTERRI Yes. \nJP Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel? \nTERRI Oh, I don't ... \nJP C'mon.  It'll be great. \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \nCLOSE on Terri's face - we can almost see her summon the will- power to refuse. \nTERRI No!  No.  I can't.  I just can't. \nShe slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her. She takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the phone. \nTERRI Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit. \nShe looks around.  She looks at the books.  She looks at the videos.  She looks at the table.  She looks back at the phone. \nANGLE ON PHONE \n- as it RINGS again. \nTERRI \n- shakes her head and turns the ansafone on. \nAfter two rings, the machine responds. \nJOEY (ansafone message) Hi.  You've reached Joanne Summerskill. In spirit at least.  Please leave a message.  Thanks. \nWOMAN (on phone) Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey. Sorry to call so late but I was wondering if you got my other message? Look, I probably shouldn't say this on tape but what the hell ... there's a job here if you want it.  Late-night news reader.  We think you'd be marvelous .. \nThe machine BEEPS and cuts her off, leaving the message light FLASHING. \nCLOSE on Terri's face - disappointed and sad. \nINT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT \nJoey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors. \nAs Kirsty speaks, INTERCUT between Joey and the monitors. \nKIRSTY (Looks to side)  Again?  (Shrugs. Looks back at camera)  The box.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know who made it or why.  I only know what it does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn. It wants to open, that's the thing.  And it knows when you want to open it.  And it helps.  And it opens.  And then they come.  The Cenobites.  The demons. \nANGLE ON WALL OF MONITORS \nMultiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines. \nSuddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE NOISE WIPE-OUT. \nJoey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock. \nANGLE ON MONITORS \n- as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears: \nA hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early experimental TV images) of a thirtysomething man in early twentieth century military uniform. \nThe man - ELLIOTT - stares directly out of the monitor screen and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line (\"The cenobites. The demons.\"), he speaks (in an English accent). \nELLIOTT (on monitor) She's telling the truth, Joey. \nAnother BURST of WHITE NOISE and the image is gone. \nKirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others. \nKIRSTY Look, you can have me tell this ... \nJoey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock. What the hell is going on? \nTERRI No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again. \nJP Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this. \nTerri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of tears.  She really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy. \nTERRI Really? \nJP Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright. \nGod, the bastard's good at this.  Terri breaks into small sobs and holds her arms out for him. \nJP No.  No, sweetheart, you come to me. It's not fair.  I come over there.  You know.  We're on the bed.  I just ... 'cos you know how much you excite me. God, just looking at you.  You're so beautiful.  I come over there and I'd just want to touch you.  Feel you.  Kiss you.  And that isn't what this is about. C'mon, babe, come to daddy.  Let me make it better. \nTerri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up. \nShe's walking toward JP.  And the pillar. \nJP puts a hand out.  He smiles.  Re-assuring.  Loving. \nTerri walks.  Vulnerable.  So in need of reassurance and love. \nWIDER ANGLE -JP, TERRI, PILLAR \nShe's getting closer ... closer ... closer ... \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JP \n- as he blows it.  A sidelong glance at the pillar?  A sudden naked hunger in the smiling eyes?  A single bead of sweat? Some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game. \nTerri stops dead.  She doesn't know what's happening but suddenly this doesn't feel right. \nTERRI No ... Wait a ... \nEVERYTHING ERUPTS! \nJP, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri. \nTerri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear. \nPinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air. \nPINHEAD Bring her to me, boy! \nA furious, confused scene of tension and struggle. \nJP has hold of Terri, trying to drag her to the monster. \nTerri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and kicking against him.  They are perilously close to the pillar. \nPinhead is furious - roaring, tearing at the pillar with his hands as if trying to physically rip himself. free of it. \nSlowly, JP's size and strength is telling; Terri is being dragged nearer and nearer to the demon. \nAt the last possible second - when it seems it's all over, when Pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from Terri's flesh - Terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar and smashes JP right across the head with it. \nJP collapses semi-conscious at the foot of the pillar. \nTerri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms. \nPinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage. \nWIDER ANGLE \nTerri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare. \nAnd suddenly Pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring beast of a moment before to his more usual persona - the glib, articulate Black Pope of Hell. \nPINHEAD Wait!  Why run?  Where to?  Do you know where you are? \nTERRI I'm ... I'm ... \nPINHEAD You're at the door of dreams.  And you can open it. \nTERRI What are you talking about? \nThere is no-one in the room. \nThe TV set is still dead. \nBut ... the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange DIM ORANGE LIGHT is creeping in from the main room.  And that seems to be from where the music is coming. \nANGLE ON JOEY \n- as she gets out of bed. \nShe's cautious and careful, moving slowly and quietly as she wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door. \nThe music continues to play. \nShe opens the door slowly and walks through. \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \nThis room too is empty. \nThe music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture. \nVARIOUS ANGLES - JOEY'S POV \n- as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the light; \nThe sofa. \nThe bookshelfs. \nThe TV - with the still and inactive Box. \nThe closed drapes over the big picture window. \nFinally - \nANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR \nBoth the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet door across the room.  They're both coming from behind it. \nJoey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful.  She opens the closet door and looks in. \nThe closet is where Joey has stored her past.  But she's stored it neatly. \nBoxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas, clippings from small-town newspapers (\"Death of a Local Hero: Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam\", \"Joanne Summerskill Class Valedictorian: looks to career in Media\") etc etc. \nAlso in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from which the lilting music is coming. \nAt some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes. \nIt's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off the shelf of the closet.  This radio isn't plugged into anything except the paranormal. \nCLOSE on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond. \nJOEY How .... ? \nJoey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and out into the main room.  She sets it down on the coffee table in front of the sofa. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE \nFormal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the background. \nJoey kneels up in front of the table. \nShe stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous HELLRAISER movies stare at the Box. \nHer fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle. She plays with the dial, moving through various \"stations\". \nJoey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them, as if she is waiting for clues.  Or instructions. \nThe music gives way to various VOICES; \nAn Indian voice giving some kind of commentary.  The English words \"BBC\" and \"World Service\" are heard amidst the punjabi. \n(Joey turns the dial) \nA CREAK is heard OFF.  Joey looks up. \nJOEY'S POV \nAt the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has creaked open an inch or two. \nJoey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott. \nJOEY Thanks.  I think. \nJoey crosses to the door and opens it.  She walks through. \nEXT.   FLANDERS FIELD   DAY \nJoey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most recent dream.  She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke. \nJOEY What's going on?  Is this a dream? \nShe glances back at the door of the hut she has just left. \nJOEY'S POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR \nWithin the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits. \nANGLE ON JOEY \n- as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes wide in shock. \nStanding on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield skies, is Elliott. \nJoey walks toward him. \nElliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey. \nELLIOTT Joey.  How kind of you to come. \nA beat.  Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field. \nJOEY Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this? \nELLIOTT You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are? \nJOEY It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right? \nELLIOTT Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain. \nHe extends his hand. \nJoey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his. \nJOEY Joey Summerskill. \nElliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand. \nELLIOTT Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right? \nJOEY Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on? \nELLIOTT Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while? \nHe gestures with his hand and they begin to walk. \nELLIOTT There were days in this war, days right on top of each other, when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands.  They called it the war to end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You know that.  There were more wars.  More dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream search for your father led you here.  To me.  Joey, we need to talk. \nElliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut. \nINT.   QUONSET HUT \nThe frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the box.  The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he speaks to the bemused Joey. \nELLIOTT The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant. \nJOEY And what is ... this frozen moment? \nELLIOTT The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery. \nPinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him. \nFor the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there are a few murmurs from them; \nCROWD (ad-lib) Oh My God ... \nJesus Christ! \nWhat the FUCK ... ?! \nNo no no no no no no .... \nPinhead scans the club. \nHe looks at the terrified humans.  The cruelly beautiful artworks.  The humans.  The artworks.  The humans.  The artworks. \nA small smile forms on his face.  He's just had an entertaining idea. \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \nThe view through the big picture window is entirely normal again; the cityscape by night. \nSuddenly, Joey seems to appear behind the glass - translucent, like a reflection - and comes through the window into her apartment, \"solidifying\" as she steps in. \nHer hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps. It's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit her.  She falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \n- as the ringing of a phone grows in volume. \nJoey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her. \nShe crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it.  The hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor. Maneuvering herself into a sitting position, she speaks. \nJOEY Hello? \nDOC (on phone) You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ... (click) ... \nJOEY Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello? \nShe puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the TV. \nTV IMAGE/DOC'S SHOULDERCAM: \nEXT.   CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB   NIGHT \nThe images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage. \nDoc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening. \nSirens howl, red emergency lights flash. \nIt becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster. Or a massacre. \nThe club building looks like a bomb hit it.  Smoke and debris litter the street.  So do corpses. \nSome of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies.  Others - glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively.  In fact they bear hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with machinery inside instead of muscle. \nDOC (off) Judas Priest!  Will you look at ... \nSuddenly, the images are blocked by a very BURLY COP pushing at the camera and talking directly into it. \nBURLY COP Move it!  Now!  No pictures! \nDOC (off) W-QQY.  I ... \nBURLY COP I don't give a shit!  Move it or lose it! \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \nCLOSE on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing.    (INTERCUT with Doc's footage) \nJOEY Oh my God, it's happening ... \nStanding in the center of the alley at its far end, light coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead. \nELDER COP (Calm. Expecting obedience) You, fuckoff. \nHe turns back to Eddie. \nELDER COP Get your head outta your stinkin' ass and look at me, boy. \nYOUNGER COP (still looking down alley) Hey ... \nPinhead is moving up the alley towards the action. \nElder Cop shoves Eddie away. \nELDER COP (to Eddie) Get lost. \nEddie doesn't waste time with questions.  He's gone. \nThe Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead. \nPinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black shape moving forward. \nELDER COP I have the distinct impression I told you to fuckoff.  Unless I miss my guess, you've just disobeyed an officer of the law. \nPinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley. \nPINHEAD I am the Law. \nCops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them instinctively drawing their guns.  And both instinctively beginning to back up. \nELDER COP You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and you're about to dead meat. \nPINHEAD I am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no ending. \nWell, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law.  Both cops fire their guns.  Once.  Twice.  Three times. \nPinhead keeps walking.  He spits out the bullets that his body has absorbed. \nYOUNGER COP Oh shh ... \nThey empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run down the alley.  And then stop short.  There is a sudden wall of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet. \nThe cops turn, terrified, to look back.  Instinctively, they spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls. \nThe younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.  He glances up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.  No.  Too high. \nPinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command. \nSuddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible speed and force. \nThe Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.  The ladder smashes right through his body, impaling him. \nHis corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped around the ladder. \nElder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate. \nELDER COP No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. \nPinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly. \nPINHEAD Curb your tongue. \nThe Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily.  His movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to fight what his body is trying to do. \nPinhead's head moves through various positions.  His face is calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new- found skills. \nThe Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs from his belt. \nHis eyes show terror.  Everything else is beyond his control. \nHe raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open. \nHis mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes. \nThe fear in his eyes increases. \nPinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He repeats the operation with the other palm. \nHe turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous parody of Christ's stigmata. \nPINHEAD I am the Way. \nThe Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead. \nPRIEST You'll burn in Hell for this! \nThe Priest reaches him.  Pinhead's hand is on his throat instantly, squeezing silence from him. \nPINHEAD Burn?  What a limited imagination. \nThe choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to his knees before him. \nPinhead towers over the Priest.  He smiles. \nWith his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from the decorative wounds on his chest.  He holds the bloody piece of meat up. \nPINHEAD This is my body.  This is my blood. Happy are they who come to my supper. \nPinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh into the Priest's aghast mouth. \nPinhead flings the priest away from him. \nThe Priest lands heavily on the floor. \nPinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside. \nAll the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing through the Church. \nPinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest. \nAnd all the candles go out. \nBLACKNESS \nINT/EXT   JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS   NIGHT \nJoey is driving again.  And this time she's not even stopping at red lights.  She steams across junctions, leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake. \nSomething catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side. \nJOEY (appalled) Oh God ... \nJOEY'S (MOVING) POV \nUp a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church.  It's on fire. \nJoey swings the car up the hill. \nSMASH-CUT TO: \nJoey getting out of the car nearer the burning church.  Off to her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall. \nJoey shakes her head at the desecration.  She has no doubt who's responsible. \nJOEY Having fun en route, you bastard. \nSuddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her. \nJoey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round. \nJOEY'S POV - SHOCK REVEAL \nThe Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the side wall of the smaller building.  Pinhead's nails protrude from his palms and his ankles. \nEXT   CITY STREETS   NIGHT \nA SERIES of QUICK CUTS of Joey's car tearing through the darkness heading back to her apartment. \nINT.   CORRIDOR, JOEY'S APT. BLDG.   NIGHT \nJoey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly turns the lock and rushes in. \nJoey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because now the pyrotechnics start. \nElliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt. \nELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT begins to play over both their bodies. It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain, both faces grimacing. \nJoey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony. \nJOEY Elliott!  No!  What about you?!  Where will you be?! \nElliott grunts his answer through the agony. \nELLIOTT Back with the damned.  No more hope of heaven.  But I drag this monster back with me! \nPINHEAD You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH! \nVARIOUS ANGLES ON THE THREE SELVES - PINHEAD, ELLIOTT, AND THE SEATED OFFICER \nThe essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle in the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm ... \nUntil they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears inside him in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. \nAnd suddenly, as vision returns, there is only the seated officer   (and, at the far end of the room, Joey). \nAnd, almost as suddenly, the frozen scene comes to life; \nThe radio near the camp bed is playing. \nA bead of sweat falls down the Officer's face as he reaches forward to pick up the Box. \nThe Officer, apparently completely unaware of Joey's presence, begins to work the Box. \nAs the process works through, we INTERCUT CONSTANTLY BETWEEN \n1)  The Officer's hands and the movements of the Box here in the Hut in 1921. \n2)  EXACTLY MATCHING movements of the Box back on the floor of Joey's apartment in 1992.  Moving on its own, linked across the years to its earlier self. \n3)  Joey watching the movements in the Hut. \nJOEY Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't hear me, can you?  It's 1921.  I'm not really here ... \nSuddenly, small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box, shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock and fascination as ... \nOn the floor, the box begins to open. \nThe Officer kneels up and leans over the Box ... \nAnd the chains fly!  Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest. \nCLOSE ON the Officer's face, howling in agony. \nCLOSE ON Joey's face, sobbing in distress.  She throws up her hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she lowers them, ... \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \n.. she's back in her room. Alone.  Window intact.  Normal view. \nJoey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief. \nThe mood now is very down, post-cataclysmic, post-adventure. \nJoey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the kitchen door. \nShe crosses the floor without glancing down at it.  Why should she?  Everything's over.  But we notice, even if she doesn't, that the Box is no longer there.  But we hardly have time to register this before ... \nJoey opens the kitchen door. \nJOEY (SCREAMS!!!!) \nPinhead is framed in the doorway. \nBehind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is full of shadowy pillars and chains. \nPINHEAD Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years? \n", "test1_input": "JOEY What?  I wasn't talking about ... I ... Do you want to stay?  You want to stay here for a while? \nTerri shrugs, gives a nervous smile. \nJoey crosses to the TV, picks up the Box and weighs it in her hand. \nJOEY OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look \u0096 you have to help me.  I've got to solve this thing.  I've got to know what's going on. \nTerri follows across the room and sits on the sofa. \nTERRI But I don't know what's going on. \nJOEY Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue? \nTERRI Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ... \nJOEY Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid? \nTERRI No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue. \nJOEY That you found.  What do you mean you found it? \nTERRI I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. \nJOEY Would you know this store again? \nTERRI Sure.  Why? \nJOEY It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping. \nEXT.   DERELICT STREET   DAY \nJoey's Mazda 323 drives down the street. \nThe daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.  It has the feel of a ghost town, as if nothing has breathed here for years. \nANGLE IN CAR \nJoey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face. \nTerri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window. \nJOEY Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street? \nTERRI Yeah.  Happening, isn't it? \nJOEY What on earth were you doing down here? \nAn evasive silence. \nJOEY Terri? \nTERRI Buying some drugs, alright? \nJOEY Oh, Terri ... \nTERRI For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore. \nJOEY Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ... \nTERRI Here!  Here!  Pull over! \nJoey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store. \nTerri scrambles out of the passenger door. \nTERRI Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY \n- as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her new and screwed-up friend. \nINT.   CARDUCCI\u0092S ANTIQUES   DAY \nJoey and Terri enter the store. \n", "test1_true": "Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old, interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd. \nThere seems to be no-one in attendance. \nANGLE ON GIRLS \n- as they walk through the store. \nMAMA (off) Can I help? \nThe voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it. \nMama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a customer in decades.  Not aggressive, just surprised. \nJOEY Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ... Terri, show her the box. \nTerri removes the box from her purse and holds it up. \nMAMA No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ... \nJOEY No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ... \nMAMA Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns. \nJOEY No.  We want ... \nMAMA I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ... \nTERRI Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break. \nA sudden silence.  Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in surprise. \nMama looks back at Joey. \nMAMA Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem? You tell me.  You I like. \nJoey smiles.  Terri raises her eyes to heaven.  Mama waits. \nJOEY Thank you.  This came off a ... statue? A pillar.  We wondered if you knew anything about the piece.  About where it came from. \nMama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it. \nMAMA Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly. Real ugly.  I sold that? \nMama's eyes scan the store. \nMAMA Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing? \nJOEY Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it? \nMAMA It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff. \nJOEY What else came with it?  Anything still here? \nMAMA Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want. \nJOEY Can we see? \nMAMA You gonna buy? \nJOEY I don't know.  Maybe. \nMAMA Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON REAR OF STORE \nJoey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall. \nA shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden floor a few yards in front of the shelves. \nJoey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and begins to look through it. \nJOEY Terri, check out the other folder. \n", "test1_id": 1716, "test2_input": "SANDY A prize?  For what? \nJP You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ... \nSANDY The barman?  I thought he was called Rick? \nJP He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue? \nSANDY I'm sorry. \nJP Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty. \nSANDY Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ... \nJP Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it... \nWhile talking, and without taking his eyes off Sandy, JP gestures at the barman and their glasses. \nJP ... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month. \nSANDY No.  Really? \nTwo full glasses join the still half-full ones on the bar. \nJP Yes really. \nSANDY Wow.  Thank you. \nJP No.  Thank you. \nANGLE ON GLASSES \nTIME-FADE \nANGLE ON GLASSES \nNow there are six empty glasses on the bar and two half-full ones. \nANGLE UP TO JP AND SANDY ... \n- except they're not there.  The two bar-stools are empty. \nINT.  JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT \nThe music OFF from the club is dull and muffled. \nJP1s private room is the size - and shares the general appearance of - an expensive studio apartment. \nHis room looks like an annex to his club - black walls, black fittings, artworks of elegant cruelty - show that JP's taste for the bizarre is not just professional. \nCamera explores the room as the sound of BREATHING grows OFF. \nANGLE ON PILLAR \n- now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room.  As usual, it looks jarring and impressive but it doesn't really seem out of place in JP's room. \nThe Breathing OFF becomes mixed with MOANS and SMALL CRIES. \nANGLE ON BED \nJP and Sandy, both naked, are on the bed making love.  Well, maybe Sandy's making love.  JP's having sex. \nIt is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on JP's concern only for his own gratification.  It may be an erotic sight, but it's not a pretty one. \nJP is on top.  He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his hands and his body is working away rhythmically.  He is half- upright, looking down at her.  No kissing. \nCLOSE on JP's face - his eyes open, staring down at Sandy. \nCLOSE on Sandy's face - her eyes closed, half in pleasure, half in shame. \nSMASH-CUT TO PILLAR \nCLOSE on Pinhead's face.  Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.  A BLUE LIGHT seems to pulse from within the pillar, lending color to Pinhead's face. \nPinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a climax. \n", "test2_true": "INT.  MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT \nANGLE ON DESK \n- FAVORING the telephone/answering machine, its red message light blinking in the darkness of the apartment. \nHeard OFF is the sound of Joey coming in to her apartment - doors opening and closing, bags being put down, footsteps etc. \nJoey's hand comes into frame and presses the message button. \nWIDER ANGLE \n- as Joey waits for her machine and glances around the room for Terri. \nJOEY Terri? \nANGLE ON SOFA - JOEY'S POV \nThe sofa is empty. \nJoey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine kicks in. \nFALLON (on ansafone) Ms.  Summerskill.  Joanne.  Hello.  This is Dr. Fallon.  Martin.  Your reference material is on its way to you.  I very much enjoyed talking to you and I hope that if I'm ever in town you'll do me the honor of (sqwaaaaalk) \nJoey has her finger on the fast forward button. \nJOEY In your dreams, pal. \nThe chipmunk-squeal of Fallon's voice is replaced by the warning-beep of a second message.  Joey lets it play. \nWOMAN (on ansafone) ... your number from your resume. Which was very impressive, by the way. My name is Sharon Leech and you can reach me here at K-YZY in Monterey, area code 805 ... (sqwaaalk) \nJoey stops the tape. \nJOEY (to herself) Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ... \nShe glances round at the empty room again, troubled by Terri's absence.  She crosses to her bedroom door. \nINT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT \nJoey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet from the door. \nTerri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is lying on one side of Joey's bed fast asleep.  Apart from her shoes, which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed. \nJoey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled. \nJoey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end. \nShe slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and - delicately, carefully - climbs on to the other side of the bed, laying her head on the pillow she had moved. \nJOEY (whispered) Goodnight, Terri ... \nINT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT \nJP, on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital cigarette, blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy. \nSandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering around the room, admiring it and chattering. \nSANDY So cool ... \nShe approaches the pillar ... leans in close ... closer ... and ... nothing happens. \nSANDY Radical. \nShe walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls. \nANGLE ON PAINTING \nIt's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece.  The kind of crap you'd buy in a Melrose gallery. \nPerhaps it's called Biker Crucifixion.  Night-time, somewhere rural. A Hell's Angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire wrapped around his body.  At the foot of the tree his biker friends party, drink, and fuck, Harleys parked in the distance.  The crucified Angel's eyes are raised to the Moon.  He's smiling. \nWIDER ANGLE ON SANDY AND PAINTING \nSANDY Wow.  You've got great taste.  This ... well ... this really says it, you know? It's really ... dark. \n", "test2_id": 1717, "test3_input": "Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera. \nThe sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun- fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded \nLeaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest. \nThe voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are heard over the roar of battle. \nSOLDIER 1 (off) He's going.  He's going.  He's going ... \nSOLDIER 2 (off) We're losing him.  We're losing him. We're losing him ... \nThe sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to more furious endeavor. \nIt turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely. \nEXT.  FLANDERS FIELD (WW I)   DAY      (JOEY'S DREAM) \nThe POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one of a different character. \nIt appears to be early morning.  The skies are grey and overcast.  In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward \nNo jungle, no trees or grass.  The ground is baked mud disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats. \nThe atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no cries or sound of machinery. \nScattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers. \nNothing moves.  No birds sing.  It is a horrible, desolate image from the bloody pages of history.  The fields of Flanders in World War One. \nA noise begins to be heard OFF.  A low angry BUZZING. \nANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER \nA cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor dead face. \nJOEY (off) Noooooooooo ....... \nThe buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we \nCUT TO \nINT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT \nJoey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming. \nJOEY Nooooooooooo! \nThe cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is. \nShe catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom. Are the flies still feeding?  She glances around her room. \nANGLE ON BEDROOM TV - JOEY'S POV \nHer TV set is on.  The buzzing sound comes from white noise. \nJoey is puzzled and scared. \nJOEY Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!? Terri ... ? \nShe half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the TV screen's white noise is replaced by an image. \nANGLE ON TV \nAs in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white. \nThe buzzing continues, now joined by HISSING and WHISTLING that fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an impossibly distant station. \nSomewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear GHOSTLY VOICES whispering; \"Joey, Joey, Joey ... \" \nOn the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross- legged on the floor of a Quonset hut. \nOn the floor in front of him is something at which he stares - something that the image is not sharp enough to show. \nWIDER ANGLE - JOEY AND TV \n", "test3_true": "JOEY What ... What's going on?  What's happening? \nANGLE ON TV \nThe image disappears in a burst of STATIC which in turn is replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; A head- and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen. \nELLIOTT You have to help me, Joey. \nA burst of STATIC and the image disappears completely. The TV is obviously not turned on.  The room is silent. \nJoey stares at her dead TV in numbed silence. \nShe falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around her, staring at the ceiling. \nINT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT \nBLACKNESS \nA CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the door, his finger by the light-switch.  He smiles into the room and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door. \nJP Come on in. \nTerri moves past him. \nJP locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket. \nTerri registers this.  JP calms her. \nJP Not a good neighborhood.  People disappear.  (a beat)  Feel like home? It's just like you left it. \nTerri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously. She registers the pillar. \nANGLE ON PILLAR \nIt's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but - despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless. \nTERRI Not quite.  This wasn't here. \nJP No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am. \nTERRI Yeah ... yeah, it looks different. \nJP Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it. \nTERRI A girl?  Anyone I should know? \nJP Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean? \nJP has been cruising the room as they speak.  Now he's standing close to the pillar.  Terri is still some distance from him. \nTERRI Yeah right.  Look ... \nJP Terri, listen.    (a beat)   Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know. \nA pause - a tense one for the audience who know that JP has obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is.  Terri looks at JP, half suspicious, half attracted. \nTERRI I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet. \nJP Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night. \nJP smiles winningly and warmly.  A nice guy.  A nice smile.  A smile a girl can trust. \nThe pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and silent, waiting for the sacrifice. \nINT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT \nSeries of shots (maybe all CROSS-FADED) of kids dancing and drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to highlight the tension of the scene in JP's room by its proximity to this (relative) normality. \nINT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT    (MINUTES LATER) \nJP lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar. \nTerri is sitting on the bed.  She's upset.  She's been telling JP about Joey and the phone message. \nJP That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore. \n", "test3_id": 1718}

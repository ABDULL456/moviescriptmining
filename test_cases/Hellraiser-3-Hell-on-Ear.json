{"test1_input": "She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her. \nJOEY ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is. \nTERRI What is it? \nJOEY Why are you so interested? \nTERRI Sorry. \nJOEY No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father. \nTERRI (sympathetic, knowing) Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ? \nJOEY God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out. \nTERRI That's great. \nJOEY What? \nTERRI No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean? \nJOEY I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them. \nTERRI Whatever.  All I know is - this is it for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to see something else.  Have a nighttime life.  Be somebody different. \nTerri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something. \nTERRI Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just girls talking.  Like having a conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a cigarette? \nJoey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured but marginally strung-out personality.  She looks around the room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes. \nJOEY Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a minute. \nJoey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind a shelf of videos.  We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT WAR, volumes 1 thru 26.  She brings the smokes to Terri. \nTERRI Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one? \nJOEY I'm trying to quit. \nTERRI Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever? \nShe smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles, and takes one.  Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.  Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes the lid extinguishing the flame.  Terri draws a book of matches from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette. \nJOEY Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental. \nTERRI It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once. \nJoey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights both cigarettes.  Terri takes a long, fearful look at the burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her cigarette. \nTERRI Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see it is ... you give up, right?  Three days later, you get hit by a fucking truck and you know - you just KNOW \u0096 that your last thought as you go under those wheels'd be \"Jesus H. Christ, I coulda smoked another three packs!\" \nShe lays the book of matches down.  Joey's eyes go to them. \nANGLE ON MATCHES \nBlack letters on the dark-grey cover: UNDER THE UNDERGROUND. \nANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI \nTerri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes, becoming subdued and a little sullen. \nTERRI Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff. \nJOEY Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was. \nTERRI But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ... \nJOEY Did you know him? \nTERRI No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue. \nJOEY Taken what? \nTERRI The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it \n", "test1_true": "TERRI Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ... \nJOEY Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from? \nTERRI That's what I'm trying to tell you! ... \nTerri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something. \nTERRI He said they came out of this. \nShe holds her hand out and the camera TRACKS in to meet it. \nANGLE ON TERRI'S HAND/BOX \nResting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square.  It has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is recognizable as one of the \"carvings\" we saw on it. \nThere is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces and, to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies, the box is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell. \nThere is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of the box - presumably where the boy from ER had broken it off the pillar.  Camera favors this jagged shard as we \nCROSS-FADE TO \nINT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT \nANGLE ON PILLAR \nVERY CLOSE on its upper left section.  We are looking at a hole in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the Box. \nCUT TO WIDE \nThe club is empty.  The dim lighting of working hours has been replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night places have when subjected to a harsher light. \nTwo WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the night's debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping down tables and bars etc. \nWork completed, they head to the main exit. \nOne of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting. The other shouts across the apparently deserted club. \nWORKER All done, Mr. Monroe. \nThey stand a second but no response comes.  The first turns to the second and shrugs. \nWORKER (mouthing silently) Ass hole. \nHis co-worker grins and they let themselves out. \nA beat.  Another door opens into the club and JP Monroe \u0096 the club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar -  walks into the main room of the club from his private room at the back. \nJP walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom. He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar. \nThe pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is still mounted upside down. \nJP smiles possessively at the pillar - and then registers the mutilation where the Box has been ripped away. \nJP What the ... ? \nHe leans in closer to stare at the hole. \nSuddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct SQUEAK that seems to come from within the hole. \nJP starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his normally supercilious face.  He glances to right and left, gets a grip, and leans forward again. \nANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE \n- as, again, the noise comes.  Is it a squeak - or is it the creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains? \nJP's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole. Slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness. \nANGLE ON JP \nVERY CLOSE on JP's face - quizzical, enquiring ... and suddenly contorted in pain! \nJP Aaaaaahh!! \nANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE \n", "test1_id": 1716, "test2_input": "JOEY What?  I wasn't talking about ... I ... Do you want to stay?  You want to stay here for a while? \nTerri shrugs, gives a nervous smile. \nJoey crosses to the TV, picks up the Box and weighs it in her hand. \nJOEY OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look \u0096 you have to help me.  I've got to solve this thing.  I've got to know what's going on. \nTerri follows across the room and sits on the sofa. \nTERRI But I don't know what's going on. \nJOEY Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue? \nTERRI Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ... \nJOEY Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid? \nTERRI No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue. \nJOEY That you found.  What do you mean you found it? \nTERRI I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club. \nJOEY Would you know this store again? \nTERRI Sure.  Why? \nJOEY It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping. \nEXT.   DERELICT STREET   DAY \nJoey's Mazda 323 drives down the street. \nThe daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.  It has the feel of a ghost town, as if nothing has breathed here for years. \nANGLE IN CAR \nJoey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face. \nTerri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window. \nJOEY Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street? \nTERRI Yeah.  Happening, isn't it? \nJOEY What on earth were you doing down here? \nAn evasive silence. \nJOEY Terri? \nTERRI Buying some drugs, alright? \nJOEY Oh, Terri ... \nTERRI For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore. \nJOEY Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ... \nTERRI Here!  Here!  Pull over! \nJoey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store. \nTerri scrambles out of the passenger door. \nTERRI Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY \n- as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her new and screwed-up friend. \nINT.   CARDUCCI\u0092S ANTIQUES   DAY \nJoey and Terri enter the store. \n", "test2_true": "Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old, interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd. \nThere seems to be no-one in attendance. \nANGLE ON GIRLS \n- as they walk through the store. \nMAMA (off) Can I help? \nThe voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it. \nMama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a customer in decades.  Not aggressive, just surprised. \nJOEY Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ... Terri, show her the box. \nTerri removes the box from her purse and holds it up. \nMAMA No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ... \nJOEY No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ... \nMAMA Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns. \nJOEY No.  We want ... \nMAMA I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ... \nTERRI Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break. \nA sudden silence.  Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in surprise. \nMama looks back at Joey. \nMAMA Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem? You tell me.  You I like. \nJoey smiles.  Terri raises her eyes to heaven.  Mama waits. \nJOEY Thank you.  This came off a ... statue? A pillar.  We wondered if you knew anything about the piece.  About where it came from. \nMama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it. \nMAMA Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly. Real ugly.  I sold that? \nMama's eyes scan the store. \nMAMA Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing? \nJOEY Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it? \nMAMA It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff. \nJOEY What else came with it?  Anything still here? \nMAMA Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want. \nJOEY Can we see? \nMAMA You gonna buy? \nJOEY I don't know.  Maybe. \nMAMA Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON REAR OF STORE \nJoey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall. \nA shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden floor a few yards in front of the shelves. \nJoey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and begins to look through it. \nJOEY Terri, check out the other folder. \n", "test2_id": 1717, "test3_input": "Terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for somewhere to put them.  All the shelves are full.  She lays them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at the shelves, grabbing up the second folder. \nTERRI What am I looking for? \nJOEY God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues. \nTerri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she flicks through the contents. \nTERRI Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this shit?  It's like fucking business papers for God's sake! \nBored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit. \nANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER \n- as she flicks through the contents. \nTerri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE. \nJoey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws the contents out and begins to sift through them. \nThe first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the dust from the photo. \nLOW ANGLE - ON BOX \n- which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust from the photo settling next to it. \nON JOEY \nThe next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says COTTON, KIRSTY  CASE NO.  5719. \nON BOX \nThe sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF and then FADES as something strange begins to happen. \nSuddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or is the box itself glowing and shining? \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE \n- as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ... \nJoey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what she is seeing ... \nThe next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of what appears to be an ancient document. \nIt is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan.  And it is of the box seen from various angles. \nCLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE \n- as she realizes what she is looking at. \nJOEY (softly) Alright ... \nJoey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and compare it to the diagram. \nJoey gasps. \nThe miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it. \nAs if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud as the last particle of dust disappears into the box. \nJoey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand. The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit. \nTerri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey. \nTERRI Joey ... ? \nJOEY (still staring at Box) Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale. \nINT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   EARLY EVENING \nJoey is sitting behind a desk.  She has a phone in one hand and a pen in the other. \nSpread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc - and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers. \nJoey is in mid-conversation on the phone. \n", "test3_true": "Joey slams the phone down. \nShe stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep breath, and punches out a number on the phone. \nThis time Joey's voice is different. \nJOEY Hi.  Now listen.  And listen good.  I'm the Station Manager at W-QQY.  For the last half-hour you've been dicking around with my assistant.  Let me tell you something.  With or without your co- operation we are making this expose.  I assume you're smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good.  Now, if you can't put one hand on that cassette and the other on a FedEx man's butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to somebody who can. \nA pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end. \nJoey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive, persuasive purr. \nJOEY Dr.  Fallon?  How nice of you to take my call.  I understand you're in charge of video archive from the Channard Institute ... ? \nINT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT \nAnother night in Under The Underground \nKids dance. \nCustomers jostle at the bar. \nCouples neck in shadowed corners. \nLoud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various sculptures on the walls and ceiling. \nThe center of the dance-floor is packed. \nThe pillar is missing. \nANGLE ON BAR \nSitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly- packed customers - is SANDY, a very pretty teenage girl.  She is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young.  Too young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this. \nSandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it refilled.  She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe. \nThe bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS. \nJP has a speculative, predatory look on his face.  Without shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request. \nCLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose. \nSandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar. \nJP returns the smile. \nHe turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard. \nThe boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the seat without an argument and stands to join his friends. \nJP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face. \nSandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her way across to sit beside JP. \nANGLE ON JP AND SANDY \nThe deafening music playing in the club means that they have to lean in close to hear each other speak. \nJP Welcome. \nSANDY You're JP Monroe, right? \nJP Uh-huh. \nSANDY And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club. \nJP Thank you. \nSANDY Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice. \nJP It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize. \n", "test3_id": 1718}

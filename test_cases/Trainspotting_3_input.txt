EXT. STREET. DAY 
Legs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's. 
Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along. 
As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties, sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets. 
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms. The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead. 
RENTON (voice-over) 
Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers. 
Suddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him. 
In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in on him. 
He smiles. 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY 
In a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and drugged. 
RENTON (v.o) 
Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. 
EXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT 
On a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at football. 
The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear. 
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching. 
The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier. 
As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. 
Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. 
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. 
Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. 
Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. 
Renton's litany continues over the action: 
RENTON (v.o) 
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life. 
Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the astroturf. Voice-over continues. 
But who would I want to do a thing like that? 
INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY 
Renton lies on the floor. 
Swanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to shoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm. 
RENTON (v.o)

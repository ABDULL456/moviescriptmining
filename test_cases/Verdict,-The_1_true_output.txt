LAURA And what are you? A cop? 
GALVIN I'm a lawyer. 
LAURA My ex-husband was a lawyer. 
GALVIN Really. How wonderful for you. 
LAURA Yes. It was, actually. 
GALVIN Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off? 
LAURA Who says I'm the one that called it off? 
GALVIN A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name? 
LAURA Laura. 
GALVIN My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight. 
LAURA What if it wasn't you that I came back to see? 
GALVIN You just got lucky. (gets up off stool) D'you eat yet? Come on. 
She gets up from the stool and starts following him in spite of herself. 
GALVIN Jesus, you are one beautiful woman. 
INT. O'ROURKE'S - NIGHT (LATER) 
Galvin and Laura are in a booth. The remains of a dinner and drinks around them. They are both smoking cigarettes, intent on each other. Both a little drunk. 
GALVIN The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? 
LAURA I think I will. 
Galvin motions "another round" to the bartender. 
GALVIN Jimmy! (beat) That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice. 
LAURA And are they going to get it? 
GALVIN They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...' 
LAURA Maybe what? 
GALVIN (beat) Maybe I can do something right. 
LAURA And is that what you're going to do? (a beat) Is that what you're going to do...? 
GALVIN That's what I'm going to try to do. 
INT. GALVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The bedroom, dark, sound of people moving, the bedside light is flicked on. We SEE Galvin in shirt-sleeves, holding a whiskey glass a little unsettled, turning on the light, Laura, with a glass, also a bit unsteady, standing beside him. 
Both awkward. He looks at her, turns back to the bed, turns down the bed, sees the silver-framed picture of his wife, he looks back at Laura, starts to take the picture to turn it down. 
LAURA That's all right. 
She starts taking off her blouse.

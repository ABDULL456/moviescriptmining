EXT. ED AND DOLORES' HOUSE - DAY 
Ed and Dolores are being evicted.  Their belongings are scattered in front.  They bitterly carry furniture out of the house.  Ed stumbles and slurs his speech.  He is drunk. 
ED Goddamn landlord. 
DOLORES I told you this was gonna happen. 
ED Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money. 
DOLORES That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer? 
ED (he starts yelling) Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich. 
DOLORES That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend. 
ED I didn't dump you!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part! 
Ed drops the furniture.  He flops onto the sidewalk. 
DOLORES You're a fuckin' mess. 
ED So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay. 
DOLORES I'm going to my mother's. 
ED Does she have room for me? 
Dolores shakes her head. 
DOLORES I think you should stay with one of your friends. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TOWERING TEMPLE - NIGHT 
Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot.  Ed is sobered up and remorseful.  Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar. 
ED Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore... 
BELA Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits. 
They reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern based quasi-religious temple.  Bela puts out his cigar, and they enter the oversized doors. 
INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME 
Sphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls.  A service is in progress.  A wiry, enigmatic LECTURER speaks. 
LECTURER Thou eternal sun, who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc, do thou remove the veil so that I may see the truth within? 
Bela leads Ed to a seat, stepping past men in fezzes and odd elderly women in fur coats.  As the lecture continues, Ed WHISPERS in bafflement. 
ED What is this place? 
BELA This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years. 
LECTURER ...for the truth which is within thee is within me.  And I am Truth. 
BELA Most people in this country, they know nothing, about Eastern mysticism. They are afraid of it. (beat) But I am open-minded.  It gives me hope. 
LECTURER We have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition.  We have the power to build worlds. 
Ed leans in to Bela. 
ED Was I wrong to cast Loretta? 
BELA Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward. 
ED But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie. 
BELA Eddie, you screwed up. 
ED (he nods) Yeah, I did. 
CUT TO: 
LATER 
The lecture is over.  The speaker shakes hands with people. Bela leads Ed along. 
BELA In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. (beat) Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture. 
ED Really? 
BELA It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king. 
ED So why didn't you do it? 
BELA I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. (pause) I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave. 
ED But maybe not. 
BELA Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one. 
They reach the exit.  Ed stops in the huge doorway. 
ED Your next film.  That will be the one. 
Bela smiles sweetly.

INT. MCCOY MEATPACKING PLANT - DAY 
We're in a noisy meat-packing plant.  WORKERS in blood-stained aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef. 
Ed walks down an aisle with DONALD E. McCOY, a wealthy Texan meat man.  Old Man McCoy is a tough-talking, tobacco-chewing, straight shooter. 
ED ...and then Dr. Vornoff falls in the pit, and his own octopus attacks and eats him!  The End. 
OLD MAN McCOY Whew!  That's quite a story.  So you made the movie, and now you want to make it again? 
ED (gently correcting him) No.  We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds.

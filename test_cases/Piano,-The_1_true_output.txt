STEWART Well that is good, yes that is good, good. 
STEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him. 
STEWART What's in here? 
ADA points to the writing already on the box saying "Crockery and Pots". 
STEWART Ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery. 
STEWART And this one? 
ADA writes "bedclothes and linen" on the pad around her neck- While she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her. 
STEWART You're small. I never thought you'd be small. 
He walks to another chest 
STEWART What's here? 
She writes "clothes". The MAORI mimic also pretends to write. 
Finally he comes to the piano box. He lifts a corner experimentally. 
STEWART What's in here then, lead? 
FLORA (gravely) It's my mother's piano. 
STEWART A piano? 
The MAORIS touch the exposed legs of the piano.  STEWART speaks to the other European man BAINES. 
STEWART Tell them to carry in pairs. 
Those three and those two the black and the red, then the suitcases. 
STEWART holds BAINES back a moment. 
STEWART What do you think? 
STEWART nods towards ADA. BAINES thinks a moment then turns towards ADA too. 
BAINES She looks tired. 
STEWART She's stunted, that's one thing. 
BAINES walks over to HONE a big man and the MAORJ leader, he stands tall with a great sense of his own importance. (Mana) 
BAINES Anei nga pouaka - ko era e toro. Me era e raa. (Here are the boxes, those three and those two.) UNSUBTITLED 
HONE E Hoal 
HONE takes an aggressive fighting posture towards BAINES, insulted that BAINES should suggest he might carry anything. HONE does not carrying, he is the boss. With great dignity HONE retreats, too injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes. ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her pad, "THE PIANO?" She shows STEWART. 
STEWART Oh no, it can't come now. 
FLORA It must come.

INT. LIVING ROOM 
George is talking to his sister, LISA. 
LISA You have to tell mom and dad. 
GEORGE I will tell them, but right at the end. I don't want them to go through all this. I can't put them through this. 
LISA I wish I wasn't so mad at you. I want to be there for you, but I am so mad at you. 
GEORGE I wish I was a better brother. 
LISA You weren't even a brother. You just left when I was a little kid. You left me there all alone, and you never treated me like a sister again. 
GEORGE You live so far away. I visited you in Kansas a few years ago. 
LISA That was six years ago, and you were only there because you had a concert. My five-year-old has never even met you. George does not know what to say. 
LISA (CONT'D) And I wanted to bring her, but then I thought she would just fall in love with you and get attached, and then what? I didn't want to do that to her. 
INT. KITCHEN 
George and Ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages. 
GEORGE Thanks a lot, pal. This is everything I didn't want to happen. It's like being at my own funeral. 
IRA Afterwards you'll be happy you did it. 
GEORGE No, I won't. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George talks to a FRIEND who rambles on and on talking about his own problems, ignoring George's. 
FRIEND It is such a tucked up situation. Life is fucked. It makes no sense. 
GEORGE Well, I really appreciate you coming by. 
FRIEND This is why I can't be close with people. What is the point? 
GEORGE Exactly. Well, I really need to rest... 
FRIEND The worst part is at night, when the TV gets turned off, and it is quiet... 
GEORGE It was so good to see you. George stands up and exits the room. Ira walks over. 
IRA I think George is going to take a nap now. 
FRIEND Oh, okay. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
A different FRIEND is talking about their own health issues. He goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments. George doesn't say a word. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
George is talking to BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. 
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN You're about to merge with the eternal. We're all going to die. No one gets out of here alive, right? George nods. 
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN (CONT'D) You lived five lives, fucker. You're 200 years old in my book. The fun you've had, the money, the adventures, the women you've known. Who wouldn't want to change places with you right new? 
GEORGE I guess so, but... 
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN You know what? There is no tomorrow, no yesterday. Only right now, and it's fucking beautiful. 
GEORGE 
(BEAT) You need to shut the fuck up right now. Have you been browsing the self-help section at Barnes and Noble? Is this what you say in between songs these days? I'm going to go right now and delete all your songs off my iPod. 
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say. I just got nervous. 
INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM 
Ira is talking George to sleep. He's gotten good at it. Warren Zevon's "Don't Let Us Get Sick" plays in the background. 
GEORGE This is awful. Awful. I hate you for having me do this.

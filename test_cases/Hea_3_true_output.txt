INT. HANNA'S CAR TRAVELLING - HANNA - NIGHT 
Floating through the green xenon nightgown, hits a stored number in his cellular phone's memory. 
CASALS (V.O.) M. C. U. 
HANNA (cuts in) Bobby, it's me. 
CASALS (V.O.) Boss, whoever's fencing the Bearer Bonds is either highline or out- of-town. Everyone's talking about it. No one knows about it. (beat) Schwartz went through the indexes on recent surveillance tapes? No armored cars. No witnesses on who stole the ambulance. 
HANNA Albert Torena call me back? 
CASALS (V.O.) No.

INT. HANNA CONDOMINIUM - HANNA - NIGHT 
Lets himself in the door.   He's beat.   He throws his coat at the chair. 
INT. KITCHEN - STOVE 
The dried-out remains of dinner. Hanna roots around, grabs a lamb chop, forgets the rest and goes into the living room. INT. HANNA LIVING ROOM - JUSTINE sees Hanna, goes back to book. 
HANNA Hi. 
JUSTINE Where have you been? 
HANNA Work. Harvey show or'd Lauren get stood up again? 
JUSTINE He didn't even call her.

HANNA What an asshole. She okay? 
JUSTINE She's been in her room all day and won't talk. So "no," she's not okay. And neither am I. (even tempered) If I try to create something like a mood between us you back away. I made a great dinner for us. That was four hours ago. (beat) At least get yourself a plate... 
HANNA There's three dead bodies in an alley off Adams. (beat) I'm really sorry the lamb got overcooked. 
Justine looks at him, elegantly rises, exits into the bedroom and closes the door. 
HANNA Looking after her is tired. Very tired. He doesn't know why he said what he did. He regrets it. So he turns on his TV to watch the news and his eyes glaze over.

INT. DINER - GRILLMAN - NIGHT 
Flips eggs, bastes, and covers them. The grill is all quilted steel and immaculate. At the other end of the counter a waiter reads a paper. 
NEIL AND EADY 
on stools. 
EADY What do you do? 
NEIL (looks at her, then away) Swimming pools. Institutional. Schools, State, counties. I'm on the sales end. (MORE)

NEIL (CONT'D) (to Grillman) Let me have another coffee. (beat) You like selling books? 
EADY (simply) Yeah. Especially fine art books. I study them. 
NEIL Yeah?   Like what? 
A little hesitant, Eady drinks her coffee. 
NEIL (continuing) Tell me. 
EADY There's a Skira edition of Delacroix charcoal sketches, I like... 
NEIL What else? 
EADY Asian art work.

EXT. EADY'S HOUSE, BALCONY - NEIL + EADY - NIGHT 
The house is high in the hill's over sunset. They stare down at the City - like an ocean of small lights. From the previous scene we HEAR: 
EADY (V.O.) The plates are mezzotints. They evoke a feeling Japanese painters called "sabi". They believed there were eight scenes of transcendental loneliness. They painted them over and over again. One is a flock of geese hovering over a field. There's always mist. It's painted just as the leader touches down. 
Pause.    They drink scotch in highball glasses. 
NEIL City of lights.

EADY Yeah. 
NEIL I flew over the arctic once at 40,000 feet. The moonlight was blue on all the snow. It felt like that. 
There's a long pause.    Then: 
EADY Do you travel a lot? 
NEIL Yeah. 
EADY Are you lonely? 
NEIL I'm alone.    Not lonely. 
He pulls her closer.    A pre-dawn red band cracks the horizon. 
NEIL (continuing) You? 
EADY I get lonely. 
His hands hold her face as he looks into her eyes and she moves to him. 
DISSOLVE TO:

Fills the screen as we PAN ALONG the drapery of sheets to Neil's wide-awake eyes. Next to him Eady's asleep.

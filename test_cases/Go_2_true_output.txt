A beat. 
ADAM I'm not delusional.

ZACK Then take her fucking arms! 
Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below. Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to help maneuver her into the car. Just then... 
Ronna MOANS. 
Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the dirt. Louder MOANING. 
ADAM She's not dead. 
ZACK No shit! 
They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half- out of the car. 
ADAM If she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. We can just leave her. 
ZACK She's almost dead. We leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her. 
ADAM What do you mean, I killed her? 
ZACK Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon. I would never testify against you. 
Adam is not reassured. 
ZACK We have to stick with Plan A. 
ADAM In Plan A she was dead. 
Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something, doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming. 
Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back, covering his ears. 
Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight.

Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds. 
And holds. And holds. 
Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved. 
ZACK Okay. New plan. 
156   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                                       156 
A CAR ALARM drones incessantly, the siren interrupted with an occasional 
CAR ALARM VOICE Back away from the vehicle. 
Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW, its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood. 
A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived. 
FILA GUY Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap out of her. 
Moving to find... 
SKATE-PUNK GUY Somebody call an ambulance! 
After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes off running. 
ADAM AND ZACK 
look around from the edge of a van in the distance. 
ZACK Look, she's fine. They're getting an ambulance. She's fine. 
Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a thought... 
ADAM What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He could still go after her.

ZACK Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our problem. Girl out of ditch -- that's her own problem. We're done. We did the right thing. 
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look... 
ZACK Okay, approximately the right thing. In a half-assed, thrown-together fashion. 
Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That just makes Adam smile more. 
ZACK Home? 
ADAM Home. 
As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING in the distance. 
157   INT. JAVAMAN CAFE / HOLLYWOOD - DAY                                     157 
Too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires. All around, Christmas lights are strung with mad abandon. 
The lights overhead FLICKER. Everyone looks up. That's when we come to find 
TODD GAINES

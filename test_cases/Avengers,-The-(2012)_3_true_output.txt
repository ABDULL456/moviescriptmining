TONY This. Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS 
HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which Stark and Pepper look on in awe. 
PEPPER I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight. 
TONY Tomorrow. 
PEPPER You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework. 
TONY Well, what if I didn't? 
PEPPER If you didn't? 
TONY Yeah. 
PEPPER You mean if you finished? (Stark nods his head) Well, um...then... She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks away in embarrassment. 
TONY Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him. 
PEPPER Work hard. As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried. 
INT. QUINJET ­ DAY 
Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET, watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver University. 
PILOT We're about forty minutes out from base, sir. Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve. 
STEVE So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula. The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart. 
STEVE Didn't really go his way, did it? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. Steve looks confused. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. Steve smiles at Coulson. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to the side with Coulson following. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board. 
STEVE Well, I hope I'm the man for the job. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. 
STEVE The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned? 
AGENT PHIL COULSON With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned. Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment. 
INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY 
Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down, watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until... 
EXT. THRONE ROOM ­ NIGHT 
...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER appears from the steps. 
THE OTHER The Chitauri grow restless. 
LOKI Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle. 
THE OTHER Battle? Against the meager might of Earth? 
LOKI Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim. 
THE OTHER You question us? You question HIM? He, who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated? 
LOKI I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed! 
THE OTHER Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. 
LOKI You don't have the Tesseract yet. THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.

{"train": "TWILIGHT: NEW MOON \nWritten By \nMelissa Rosenberg \nAdapted from the Novel by \nStephenie Meyer \nDec. 21, 2008 \nCREDITS OVER: \nA FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold. Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the moon's surface, darkening it from left to right... \nBELLA (V.O.) \"These violent delights have violent ends...\" \n... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon... which disappears into the darkness. \nOVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the blackness. BELLA (V.O.) \"... And in their triumph die, like fire and powder...\" \nHOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to reveal we're now in -- \nEXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY \nIt's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest floor. \nBELLA (V.O.) \"... Which, as they kiss, consume...\" \nSUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off -- \nON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS of her frenetic quest -- \nBELLA Edward! \nAhead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it -- \nEXT. MEADOW - DAY \nBELLA Edward! \n-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now. Instead, Bella SEES -- \nACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she recognizes -- \nBELLA ... Gran? \nGRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves, as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but -- \nEDWARD (O.S.) Bella... She spins to the voice behind her to SEE -- \nEDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from sun's rays -- \nBELLA Stop - she'll see! \nBut Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight. Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight. \nJUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening, entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to -- \nGran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is extended, as if she also holds someone. JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now. Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that -- \nGran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror, Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass! \nPULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME. It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella. \nBELLA Oh my God. \n-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five years older. \nBella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward. He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it. \nThen he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and whispers into her ear -- \nEDWARD Happy birthday. \nSMASH TO: \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A book, \"ROMEO AND JULIET,\" lays open on her chest. Bella sits up, the dream still weighing on her... INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one wrapped, one not. \nCHARLIE Happy birthday, Bells. \nBELLA Dad, we agreed, no gifts. \nCHARLIE At least mine's not wrapped. \nBELLA Right.   Class. \nCatching their breath, they start toward school... but Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated. \nEDWARD Someone wants you. \nJACOB (O.S.) Bella! JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them. \nBELLA God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge. \nJACOB Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more. \nBELLA I will, soon. But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way? \nJACOB (re: car part) Just here buying this for the Rabbit. I'm almost done with the rebuild. Gotta come take a ride when it's done. (as if remembering) Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad. So... \nHe pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers dangling from it. He hands it to her. JACOB I saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams. \nBELLA This, I need. It's great. \nEDWARD The bell's about to ring. \nThe bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with just a hint of snark. \nJACOB Ooh, look at you, all psychic. \nEDWARD I don't have that particular gift. But I can read a watch. I'm clever that way. \nThey share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing Jacob's arm. \nBELLA Bye, Jake, and thank you. \nEdward guides her away.   As they walk off -- \nEDWARD How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't? \nBELLA He's just a friend. \nEDWARD \"Friends\" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher. \nBELLA Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much. \nEDWARD Little hard to tune out. \nShe just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with resentment. Jacob holds his gaze. \nINT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small, wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it. \nALICE Happy -- \nBELLA Shh! \n-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella -- \nALICE -- birthday. \nOver Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide Alice's present, hoping no one noticed -- \nBELLA Alice, didn't I say no gifts? \nALICE You did. I didn't. I've already seen you open it and guess what? You love it. \nBELLA You had a vision about my birthday. \nALICE And about the green dress you'll be wearing to your party tonight. Great color on you. \nBELLA ... My party? \nALICE Please?     It'll be fun. \nBELLA (beat, confused) I... guess I can deal -- \nALICE (hurriedly) -- Great! See ya at seven! \nAlice hugs her again and races off before she can change her mind. Which is when Bella realizes -- \nBELLA Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood control. \nHe offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away. \nEDWARD Vampires.    You can't trust them. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 \"Romeo and Juliet\" plays. The suicide scene. \nROMEO Arms, take your last embrace, and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... \nA ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either side of the Rogue's face. Compassion? \nEDWARD (V.O.) We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die. \nAro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF. Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away... \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT \n-- as Bella spins on Edward -- \nBELLA Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else. \nEDWARD (sees she's worried) Who else would hurt me? \nBELLA You said there were more dangerous things out there than you. And I know you have at least one enemy -- \nOFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS: \n-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread- locked LAURENT (from \"Twilight\") \n-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes, feral, vicious grin (from \"Twilight\") \nBELLA (O.S.) You said she'd come after you for killing her mate. \nBACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD \nEDWARD Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win. \nBella looks up at him, pained. \nBELLA I hate that I can't protect you. \nHe laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not. \nBELLA That was me being serious. \nEDWARD (kissing her face) I know. But you do protect me... (kisses her nose) From boredom... (kisses her lips) And loneliness... (in between kisses) You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you... \n-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind -- EDWARD ... from everyone but my sister. \n-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in. \nALICE It's time it's time it's time! \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT \nAlice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then skips down the stairs. They look down into -- \nTHE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful. \nBella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to -- \nTHE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly. CARLISLE Sorry about all this.   We tried to rein Alice in. \nESME Like that's even possible.   Happy birthday, Bella. \nFLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them. \nALICE (re: camera) Found it in your bag.   Mind? \nEmmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him. \nEMMETT Dating an older woman.    Hot. \nBella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up. \nEMMETT What? \nRosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella. \nROSALIE It's a necklace. Alice picked it out. \nShe walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper across the room. They wave to each other. ALICE (aims the camera) Show me the love! \nEdward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into one another's eyes. FLASH! \nALICE For your scrapbook.    Now open your presents! \nAlice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates. \nBELLA Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty. \nALICE Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's from Emmett. The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box. \nBELLA Um... thanks? \nEMMETT Already installed it in your truck. \nCHARLIE You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother. BELLA What?   Why? \nCHARLIE I just - don't know what to do any more. You don't act like someone left you; more like someone died. \nShe looks away.   That's how it feels to her. \nBELLA I'm not leaving Forks. \nCHARLIE Bells, the bastard's not coming back. \nShe nods.   Knows this all too well. \nCHARLIE It's not normal, this behavior. And frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and your mother. (gentler) Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some new friends. \nBELLA I like my old friends. \nCHARLIE You never even see them anymore. \nBELLA I do, too. In fact, I'm... um... Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow. Shopping. \nCHARLIE (suspicious) You hate shopping. \nBELLA That's how good a friend I am. \nCHARLIE (somewhat appeased) Alright. Shopping. \nBELLA (PRE-LAP) Hi Jessica, it's Bella... \nINT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course). \nBELLA ... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow? \nEXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nBella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them bears the title of a ZOMBIE film. \nBELLA I don't get why are there so many zombie movies. \nJESSICA It's, like, a metaphor? For crass consumerism or something. \nBella glances at her. \nJESSICA Not that you'd know anything about consuming. You didn't buy anything today. \nBELLA I bought something. \nJESSICA Socks don't count. `Course, I was surprised you even called. \nBELLA I've been kind of... out of it. \nJESSICA Kind of? I mean, at first I was worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's still bumming? It's not like I wasn't going through things, too. Like Mike deciding he wanted to \"just be friends?\" That was really hard and -- \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) How `bout a ride, girls? \nAs Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS -- \nBELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, \"ONE EYED PETE'S\" (SLOW MOTION) \n-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces. \nOFF BELLA WE SMASH TO -- \nFLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS (\"Twilight\"); Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down -- \nBACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as she stares at the foursome across the street... \nThen suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear -- \nEDWARD (O.S.) Move, Bella. \nShe turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes clear when -- \nJessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN -- JESSICA Come on. \nBELLA I know them... I think... \nJESSICA Can we just go -- \nJessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off. \nBELLA I want to see something. \nMuch to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn. \nGUY #1 Alright, we got a taker. \nThe apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time. She stops. \nBELLA I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless. JACOB Oh it's totally stupid and reckless. (leans closer, grins) When do we start? \nBella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought Bella back to life. But -- \nUNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE \n-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover -- \nEXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME \nNext to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in their eyes, the danger. Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink soundlessly into the darkness of the woods... \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nTwo hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS -- \nTIM We're going the wrong way. \nNATE Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery. \nTIM (slapping a mosquito) And the West Nile virus. \nTim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops. \nTIM You hear that? \nNATE If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd have brought my grandma. \nTIM Could be one of those giant bears. NATE There are no giant -- \nRUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction, another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind, from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified. \nTIM What the hell is that?! \nNATE I don't know! \nThe guys, faced away from one another, search the trees. STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat. \nTIM Think it's gone? \nNo answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished. TIM Nate?   Nate!? \nNothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies. \nTim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath ragged, he looks over his shoulder -- \nTIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder -- \nTIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY \nA couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it -- \nEXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS) \nTim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement, he`s going to escape -- \nBAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing but a disturbing silence... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY \nMotorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches. BELLA If we're going to be working on this every day, we should probably include some homework. Don't want the Dads to think I'm a bad influence on you. \nJACOB You influence me?     Please. \nBELLA I am older than you. \nJACOB Age ain't nothin' but a number. \nBELLA And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines. \nJACOB (sudden mock-horror) God, you're right, you're like Satan -- QUIL (O.S.) Yo, Jake, you in there? \nBella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes. \nJACOB It's cool, it's just my boys. \nQUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short, stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and laid back, with chin-length black hair. \nEMBRY Hey, Jake -- \nThey stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile. \nJACOB Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's Quil and Embry. \nINT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY \nBella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun. He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft. \nJACOB We got lucky at the dump. You know how much a new crankshaft goes for? \nBELLA Sure, I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com. \nJACOB I think that's a porn site. (then) These bikes are gonna be rolling soon. Where should we ride first? \nBELLA Someplace sunny. \nJACOB Like there's any place sunny around here. \nBELLA I know a place above the cloud line -- \nThe second she says it, she regrets it -- off her -- \nFLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with Edward (\"Twilight\"), flowers surrounding them. \nJACOB (O.S.) Where is it? \nBACK ON BELLA - her face falls. BELLA Actually, it's... too hard to get to. \nHe brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue. \nJACOB So we'll find our sunny spot, right? \nShe smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the cliffs... and notices -- \nBELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF \nFOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared, Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts. They push each other, rough-housing. \nBELLA Isn't that... Sam Uley? \nJACOB (bitter) And his cult. \nSuddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck -- Jacob climbs out after her -- BELLA Oh my God!   Stop them! -- \nEXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \n-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her. \nJACOB They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving. \nBELLA What, on purpose? \nJACOB Scary as hell, but a total rush. \nBELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down. \nBella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for Edward. \nJACOB Most of us jump from lower down. \nBELLA Think I could? \nJACOB Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving? \nBELLA You said it was a rush. \nJACOB Maybe on a warmer day. And not from the top. We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples. \nThere's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him. \nBELLA You don't like them. \nJACOB They think they run this place.   Acting all bad ass, calling themselves \"protectors.\" \nBELLA What are they protecting? \nJACOB The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him. \nBella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It pains Jacob to see him. \nBELLA That's Embry? I didn't recognize him. What happened to him? \nJACOB He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them. (beat) Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out. \nBELLA Maybe you should just avoid them. \nJACOB I try but... \nShe sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly. \nBELLA Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad.   Or you can come stay with us. \nJacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank, goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees. \nAs she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up. \nJACOB What, are you training for the X-games? \nShe looks around for Edward.   He's gone. \nBELLA I want to go again. \nJACOB Forget it. I'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. Man, look at your head. \nIndeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away -- \nBELLA God, I'm sorry. JACOB You're apologizing for bleeding? \nBELLA It doesn't... bother you? \nJACOB It's just blood, Bella. \nHe bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and smooth skin. He glances at her. \nJACOB What are you staring at? \nBELLA Just, you're actually... good looking. \nHe's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles. \nJACOB How hard did you hit your head? \nBELLA (realizing) Oh I - yeah. \nHe offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it, alarmed. \nBELLA Jake, you're hot. \nJACOB Upgraded from good looking? \nBELLA No, temperature hot. (feels his forehead) You're burning up. \nJACOB I feel fine. \nHe takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries to pull it away. \nJACOB What?   I can't hold your hand? BELLA It just... means something else to you than it does to me. \nJACOB One, that's my problem. But two... we have fun, you think I'm hot -- \nBELLA Good looking. \nJACOB I know you like me. \nBELLA More than anyone.    But... that's all. \nJACOB Because of Cullen? \nThe name stings her.   He takes both her hands now. \nJACOB Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me. BELLA I already do. You don't know how much. You're my best friend but... I don't think my feelings will change. \nHe takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath. \nBELLA I'm sorry. I should've said something right from the start -- \nJACOB No. That's not -- I just feel... weird. \nBELLA I told you, you have a fever. Probably that flu everyone has. \nJACOB It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't know what it is. \nOff Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned... \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nBella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP -- \nBELLA (O.S.) Hey Jake. Just checking to see how you're doing. And to say I'm sorry, about, you know... how I feel and... hope the flu passes fast. Call me. \nEXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY \nBella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling. Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to class. BEEEEP -- \nBELLA (O.S.) Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono. He won't let me visit but... would you call me? \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP -- BELLA (O.S.) Me again.   I just... need to hear your voice... \nSuddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his EYES. Dark blood-red. \nLAURENT (conspiratorial) Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel compelled to... cheat? \nBella involuntarily takes a step away from him. \nLAURENT But that's not why I left. I came back here as a favor to Victoria. \nBELLA ... You're still friends. \nLAURENT (shrugs) More or less. She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens. Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you. \nBELLA That's... too bad. \nLAURENT Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers. Eye for an eye, mate for a mate. \nAnd now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears -- \nEDWARD Threaten him. \nBELLA Edward will know who did it.   He'll come after both of you. \nLAURENT I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected? (then) Victoria sent me here for information. She won't be happy about my killing you. BELLA No, Laurent... \nLAURENT (sincere) No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm doing you a kindness. Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully - whereas I'll make it very quick. (inhaling) And you smell so... mouth watering. \nHe faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her eyes dart around, escape is impossible -- \nThe only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking at her with alarm... \nBELLA (whispering, barely audible) Edward. I love you. Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him. \nLAURENT I... don't believe it. \nHe steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly turning... to find behind her -- \nAN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in its throat, sharp teeth gleaming. \nBella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers in her ear -- \nEDWARD Don't.   Move. \nThe wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where she stands, then -- \nFOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet- brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched, ready to spring. \nBella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET- BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously -- \n-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow -- \n-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding him before he reaches the treeline -- \nLaurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent - he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it. \nThe two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail -- \nBella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods -- \nEXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \n-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside, tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running -- \nEXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY \n-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out -- \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY \nBella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins. \nCHARLIE Bella?   What's wrong? \nBELLA They're not giant bears -- I saw them. Up in a meadow -- \nCHARLIE Damn it, I told you not to go into the woods! \nHARRY CLEARWATER What did you see, Bella? \nBELLA Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad. \nWe might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater sighs ever-so-slightly. BELLA Five of them. The size of - of cars. I swear. They went after -- something - - and I ran. \nCharlie grabs up the phone; as he dials -- \nCHARLIE Harry, can you get some men from the rez? \nHARRY CLEARWATER Sure.   Yeah. I'll just -- \nJACOB I can't be friends with you anymore. BELLA Jake, I know I hurt you. I should have been more up-front but -- I needed you, I still do. I don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time -- \nJACOB Stop.    Don't. It's not you -- \nBELLA -- \"It's not you, it's me?\"     God. \nJACOB It's true.   I'm not... good. \nBELLA You're wrong -- \nJACOB It doesn't matter.    This is over -- BELLA I can't take losing my best friend, too. \nJACOB You already have -- \nBELLA Don't say that -- you promised -- \nJACOB Go home, Bella. Don't come back. \nHe practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain... \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door. Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it. \nCHARLIE Billy called, said you and Jacob had a fight. But, hey, you guys will work it out, I'm sure of it. \nBELLA I'm... going to change. \nBella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to the open door -- UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \n-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door... \nSMASH TO: \nINT. FOREST - NIGHT \nBella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns -- finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH... \n... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS backward, suddenly many yards away. \nBELLA Why!? \nHe, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone. \nBLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud SCREECHING NOISE -- \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again! Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks around for a weapon -- \nJACOB (O.S.) (whisper shouting) Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window. \nBella cautiously moves to her window to find -- \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \nJacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling -- \nBELLA What the hell are you doing? \nJACOB Get out of the way. \nHe begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She realizes what he's about to attempt -- \nBELLA No! He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility -- \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \n-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned. He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self- satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off. He takes in her room. \nJACOB I pictured your room more... cluttered. \nBELLA Why are you here? \nJACOB I had to talk to you.   Alone. \nBELLA To kick me in the gut again? It was bad before, but you made it so much worse. \nJACOB I know. And I want to explain. But... I can't. \nBELLA Then leave. \nHe stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable. \nBELLA You're done with me, remember?   Get. Out! \nJACOB Bella, I literally can't explain... \nPaul and Jacob are beyond hearing. \nPAUL All you care about is her -- SAM (commanding) Paul, back off. \nPAUL -- and she doesn't give a crap about you -- \nJacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward. \nSAM Jacob. \nPaul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl, vibrating violently -- \nJARED Too late. \nSAM Bella, get back! Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring! \nBella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him -- \nBELLA Run, Jacob! -- \nBut he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf -- \nBELLA Jake, no!   Stop -- ! \nJacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf. \nBella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other, snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING. Their teeth flash at each other's throats. \nBella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods -- \nCAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS of the fight still ECHO -- BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off his shoes. \nSAM Take Bella to Emily's place. \nSam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence... \nEMBRY Guess the wolf's out of the bag. \nOff Bella, stunned. \nEXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny, weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared, in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry head toward the house. She doesn't move. \nEMBRY (to Jared) Pay up. She didn't puke. \nJared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks. \nEMBRY Told you she was tough.     She does run with bloodsuckers. \nBELLA Wait. We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay. \nJARED I hope Paul gets some teeth in him. Serve him right. \nEMBRY No way. Jake's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him. \nJARED Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer. \nBella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not following them. \nEMBRY Come on in.    We won't bite. \nJARED Speak for yourself. Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry pauses at the door -- \nEMBRY Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare. It bugs Sam. \nBELLA Why would I stare? -- \n-- But the guys are already entering -- \nINT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \nBella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin. SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long black hair. \nEMILY You guys hungry? Like I have to ask... Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth. \nEMILY Who's this? \nAs Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins -- \nJARED Bella Swan.    Who else? \nEMILY So you're the vampire girl. \nBELLA And you're a... you're all... \nEMILY Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one. But these animals -- (slaps Embry's hand) Save some for your brothers. \nDesolation fills him.   She sees this. \nBELLA It's bad, huh? \nJACOB I just hate feeling... out of control. Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me. \nBELLA Like you could get rid of me. \nJACOB You've seen Emily. \nThat lands with her.   She nods. \nJACOB Sam lost it for a split second; Em was standing too close -- he's still messed up about it. (beat) I don't want to be that kind of nightmare. \nBELLA You're not like that. You save people, right? You saved me from Laurent. \nJACOB Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too. \nBella stops, chilled to the bone. \nBELLA Victoria.     She's here? \nJACOB We chased her all the way to the border the other night. But she won't stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after... (sees Bella's face) ... What? \nBELLA I know what she wants.      Me. SMASH TO: \nEXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY \nA MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a blinding speed -- \nINT. MASERATI - SAME \nCLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her words laced with longing and fury. \nVICTORIA James hated cars. He liked being close to the ground. But I'd steal one occasionally, to throw him off the scent... See, we played hide and seek sometimes. No one can hide like me -- (grins to her passenger) -- but no one could seek like James. \nINCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out. \nDENISE What -- what are you -- ? VICTORIA Some games   lasted months... but we always got   hungry for each other. (sly,   to Denise) So I'd let   him find me... \nDenise now lucid, looks around to SEE -- \nIN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him -- \nDENISE Michael?    Oh my God -- \nVICTORIA We never could get enough of each other... (seething) We would have had forever to try. \nDenise, scared, shakes Michael's arm -- DENISE Michael?! \n-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side, revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins. \nVICTORIA James always loved a screamer. \nVictoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we -- \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY \nON JARED -- \nJARED Excellent. If the redhead's after Bella, we've got bait. \nWith stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head - Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it. \nJACOB She is not bait. \nINCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small, quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam, Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast. \nBELLA I should leave town. \nSAM Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her. \nBELLA No one can catch her.   She can escape anything. \nPAUL Ooh.   She has special powers. \nBELLA Some of them do. \nThey all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it. JACOB Like... what? Bella? \nJARED The mind reader you said you knew. He was a suckhead? Can they all do that? \nEMBRY That would blow. \nBELLA No, I -- shouldn't have - no. \nTHE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others... \nSTAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH -- \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME \nLIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest -- \nBACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side -- \nSMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she bursts out of the trees to -- \nEXT. THE OCEAN (CONTINUOUS) - SAME \n-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore -- \nTHE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go -- \nBACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR... \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY \nBella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down -- \nBELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps. \nEDWARD (O.S.) Step back. \nBella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She turns to find Edward's apparition at her side. \nShe steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to disappear. \nThat's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat, adrenaline pumping -- \nEdward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going -- \nEDWARD Stop this now, Bella. \nBELLA You won't stay with me any other way. \nShe takes a last look at him... then with a running leap -- FLINGS herself over the edge -- \nON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down, down... then SPLASHES into the water. EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \nNo sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up. Inhales deeply -- and laughs! \nBELLA Yes! \nShe enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes how strong the current is... \nA WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under... \nUNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles -- \nABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES -- \nBELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish, bobbing on the surface of the water -- \nBella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing is suddenly thirty yards closer. \nBella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks. \nANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips below the surface, vanishing... UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love. He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR -- \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nCLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious. \nJACOB Breathe, Bella! C'mon! \nJacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to. \nJACOB Bella?   Can you hear me? \nBELLA ... Jake? She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved. Behind him stands Sam. \nSAM She'll be alright. \nSam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something. \nJACOB What the hell were you thinking? \nBELLA I needed... to see... something. \nBELLA It's Carlisle's car!   They're here. Go back! -- \nJACOB It's a trick -- \nHe's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out -- \nJACOB Damn it, Bella -- \nEXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \nBella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's suddenly standing in front of her, furious -- \nJACOB Stop.   You gotta come with me. BELLA It's okay.   They're my friends -- \nJACOB Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands. \nBELLA -- It's not a war -- \nJACOB It is. And you'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore. \nBELLA I don't need you to -- \nJACOB -- You're about to cross a line -- BELLA Only if you draw one. \nShe starts to move past him, but he stops her -- \nJACOB I'm not letting you do this. \nBELLA You don't have a choice.   I don't belong to you. \nHer words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but can't take them back. He hands her the keys. \nJACOB Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die. \nShe flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road. \nShe's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her... nothing but darkness... she faces forward again --- \nAnd runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice. \nBELLA Alice! ALICE You're... alive. \nShe's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy. \nBELLA Oh my God, Alice.    You're here. \nALICE I heard voices - I didn't think it was you but - you're alive. \nBELLA You keep saying that. \nALICE I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too late but -- (becoming angry) Why the hell would you try to kill yourself?! \nBELLA I didn't.    I was cliff diving. \nALICE Why?! \nBELLA Um... fun? \nALICE That was fun for you. \nBELLA Until I hit the water. \nALICE I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell? \nBELLA Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a werewolf. \nOff Alice's horrified expression. \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces. \nBELLA Werewolves are not vicious. \nALICE Until they lose their tempers. \nBELLA They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria -- \nALICE (shocked) Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled from the water either. \nBELLA It was Jacob who saved me. More than once. I couldn't have made it without him. You have no idea what it was like. \nALICE (softening) Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't be good for you. I tried to tell Edward, but he wouldn't listen. \nBELLA (hesitantly) ... Does he know you're here? \nALICE No.   He's been... away... \nINT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY \nJACOB You alone? \nBELLA Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral? \nJACOB Had to talk to you first. (to the guys) I'll meet you there. Go on. \nThey're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into -- \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him... BELLA Look, Jake, I'm sorry I -- \nJACOB This place stinks to hell. \nShe sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well. \nBELLA You're welcome to leave.      In fact -- \nJACOB -- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying? \nBELLA (snapping back) Just Alice. And she'll stay as long as she wants. \nJACOB Are the rest coming back? \nBELLA Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else? \nJACOB That's it. \nBELLA Better go report to Sam. \nJacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger turn to hurt. He stops. Beat. \nJACOB I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you. \nBELLA It doesn't have to be this way. \nHe moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness. \nJACOB Yeah, it does. \nBELLA Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob? \nHe can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek. JACOB It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it? \nThey look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face, his eyes searching hers. \nSlowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away... \nSuddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump. Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers -- \nJACOB Swan residence. \nShe smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold. \nJACOB He's not here. He's at a funeral... \nThen the phone goes dead -- \nINT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME \n-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief- stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it. \nINT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME \n-- Jacob hangs up the phone. \nJACOB Filthy bloodsucker. \nBELLA Wait, who was it? \nJACOB (spitting it out) Dr. Carlisle Cullen. \nBELLA You should have let me talk to him. \nJACOB He didn't ask for you -- \nSuddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph. JACOB Step away from me, Bella. \nBella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella immediately hurries to her side. \nBELLA Alice, what's wrong? \nALICE ... Edward. \nBELLA What about him? What happened? \nALICE I just saw him in a vision.   He... thinks you're dead. \nEDWARD It's alright. Alice will catch you. \nEdward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole -- INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \n-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri. \nEdward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring, but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach -- \nA FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside. They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them -- \nSMASH TO: \nCLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into -- \nINT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \nAn elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist. \nGIANNA Buon pomeriggio. \nThey head through the lobby to -- \nTHE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally, they reach the carved double doors which open -- \nINT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \nBella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients: Aro, Marcus, Caius. \nEight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats. \nBELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center that leads to a drain. Bella shivers. \nAro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's hand and shaking it -- \nARO What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful? \nCaius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as -- \nARO Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her? \nEDWARD It's not without effort. \nARO (laughing) I can see that. \nOff Bella's look, Edward explains -- \nEDWARD One touch and Aro can see every thought I've ever had in my life. \nARO You're quite the telepath yourself, Edward. Though... you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating. \nHe releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella. ARO I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well. \nHe reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his hand. Bella finally takes it. \nA beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him. \nARO Interesting. \nHe releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought. \nARO I wonder if -- \nEDWARD (reading Aro's thoughts) No! \nARO Let's see if she's immune to all our powers, shall we Jane? \nJane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her -- \nJane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain. BELLA Stop! \nBella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks away, Edward's pain ceases. \nARO Jane, dear.    The girl? \nJane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy. \nJane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with a tiny gesture. \nARO Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So what do we do with you now? \nMARCUS (seemingly bored) You already know what you'll do, Aro. \nCAIUS She knows too much; she's a liability. \nARO That's true. Unless Edward intends to give her immortality... (looks at Edward) But that's not your intention, is it. Shame. \nHe nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a step before Edward tackles him. \nINT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \n-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall. As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming toward them -- \nA GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire, HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass. As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile -- \nDEMETRI (sotto) Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me. \nHeidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then continues on. \nHEIDI (to the group) This way, please. Stay together... \nA HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass Bella. The Husband winks at Bella -- \nTOURIST HUSBAND Unusual tour, isn't it? TOURIST WIFE Bill, get a picture of that bust there. \nAs the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages, German, Japanese, English. \nThe group is moved toward the carved double doors which swing open for them. They file into the marble hall -- \nEdward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as the last of the tourists disappear inside. \nAs the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING -- \nEdward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder -- \nSMASH TO: \nINT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS -- Bella sits bolt upright, yelling -- \nBELLA -- Stop! \nShe catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her. \nBELLA It... wasn't a dream. \nEDWARD Go back to sleep. You've been through a lot. \nBELLA No, you might -- \nEDWARD I'll be here when you wake up. \nBeat, she looks at him, wary. \nBELLA Why?   Out of guilt? \nEDWARD (realizing) You... think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty? BELLA Didn't you? \nEDWARD I went to them because I thought I'd lost you. \nBELLA You didn't even want me. \nNow Edward takes her by the shoulders. \nEDWARD Bella. The only reason I left was to protect you. I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life. \nBELLA But it was so easy for you to leave. \nEDWARD I had to be convincing. But easy?     In my hundred years, I've never had a harder time than what I just went through. \nShe's beginning to believe him. \nBELLA I kept seeing you. Visions of you. Always protecting me. I thought I was going crazy. \nEDWARD Your own instincts were speaking to you. I wish it had been me. But you're the heroic one. You saved me. \nHe moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly -- \nHER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone. \nCHARLIE You alright? Another nightmare? \nBELLA I'm okay.    You don't have to worry. \nCHARLIE Last time you said that, you disappeared. You want to talk nightmares? BELLA (sincere) I'm really sorry, Dad. \nCHARLIE Just... don't ever do that to me again. Okay? (off her nod) And you're grounded for the rest of your life. \nBELLA I know. \nCHARLIE Get some rest so I can keep lecturing you in the morning. \nHe kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find Edward sitting on the bed. \nEDWARD He won't forgive me easily. \nBELLA Nope. \nVICTORIA (a slow grin) Sounds perfect. \nAs she climbs in... \nINT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING \nEdward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned. \nEDWARD When? BELLA After graduation. \nEDWARD Just two months. \nBELLA It'll be best for Dad that way. I can pretend to be at college somewhere. Carlisle suggested it. But... (quiet, emotional) I wish you'd be the one to change me. \nEDWARD (beat) Would you be willing to trade for that? \nBELLA (hopeful) Name it. \nEDWARD Five more years as a human. \nBELLA The Volturi won't wait that long. \nEDWARD I'll settle for three. \nBELLA (sadly, shakes her head) I won't risk it. It'll have to be Carlisle. \nHe takes her hand. \nEDWARD Why are you so willing to give up your soul? \nBELLA Because I don't believe you've lost yours. And I want to share mine with you forever. \nHe looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward SLAMS on the brakes -- \nTHEIR POV - THE ROAD \n-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them -- it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods. BELLA What is he doing? \nEDWARD He wants to talk to me. \nBELLA Well, he can talk to me first. \nShe pushes out of the car -- \nINT. WOODS - MORNING \nEdward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob leaning against a tree. His expression is hard. \nJACOB You're still alive. \nBELLA I've been calling you. JACOB Couldn't drop by? \nEDWARD He thinks I'm keeping you away. \nJACOB (spinning on him) Stay the hell out of my head! \nBELLA Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying to get back before he wakes up. \nJacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic. \nEDWARD Jacob, I know you have something to say to me, but I'd like to say something first. Alright? \nJacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting. \nEDWARD (sincere) Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't. \nJACOB No, you didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me. \nEDWARD I know. I'm still grateful. (then) But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away. \nShe looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it. \nJACOB We'll see. \nEDWARD Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out. \nJACOB She's been laying low. Ever since your freaky sister showed up. Guess she can't stand you Cullens either. \nEDWARD She'll come back. \nJACOB She does, she's ours.   She killed on our turf. \nEDWARD We'll see. \nJACOB My turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty. \nEDWARD (reads his thoughts, nods) I haven't forgotten. \n", "test1_input": "BELLA Stop.   I don't want normal, I want you. \nEdward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into -- \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \nThe truck stops.   Beat. \nBELLA You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age... as long as I'm human... EDWARD (appalled) That's your solution?   My ending your life? \nBELLA Your giving me forever. \nHe faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented. She reaches for his hand -- \nBELLA Carlisle told me how you feel, about my soul, but I don't believe that -- \n-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers. \nEDWARD You should go in. It's late. \nHe climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face - he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek. \nBELLA I'll leave my window open for you. \nEDWARD (quietly) I won't be coming back.   Not tonight. \nBELLA Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's still my birthday. (off his nod) Kiss me? \nHe lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye. \nAbruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks off into the night. Off Bella... \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY \n\"Romeo and Juliet\" lessons are on the board. Everyone's scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty -- \nFLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S EYES, hard, turning away from her... \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY \nBella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke, throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward. \nFLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND moving away from hers... \nBACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to -- \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nPAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it out, takes a closer look... EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY \nON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house but stops, relief washing over her -- \nBELLA Edward.   You're here. \nHe stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask. \nEDWARD Walk with me? \nEdward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets him guide her toward the woods... \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nEdward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella. \nEDWARD We need to leave Forks. \nBELLA What?   Why? \nEDWARD It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing. \nBELLA But... when? \nEDWARD Now. \nBella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally -- \nBELLA I'll have to think of something to tell Charlie, but I can be ready -- \nEDWARD Not you.   Us. \nBELLA (stunned) What? -- no -- Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing. EDWARD Nothing compared to what could happen. You don't belong in my world. \nBELLA -- I belong with you -- \n", "test1_true": "BELLA -- I'm coming -- \nEDWARD I don't want you to come! \nBella is stung, as if slapped. \nBELLA You don't... want me. \nEDWARD No. \nShe steps back.   Trying to understand this. \nEDWARD I'd like to ask one favor though. \nBELLA (looks up, hopeful) Anything. EDWARD Don't do anything stupid or reckless -- do you understand? (adding) ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take care of yourself. \nBELLA I... yes... I will. \nHe softens ever-so-slightly. \nEDWARD Don't worry. You're human. Time heals all wounds for your kind. Particularly if you're not reminded. \nDesperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity. \nBELLA No, this is - don't do this.     Please. He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face turns cold again. \nEDWARD Try to understand. Every second with you is about restraint. You're too fragile. I'm tired of pretending to be something I'm not. Reining myself in so I can be with a human. \nBELLA Then take my soul. I don't care!        I don't want it without you -- \nEDWARD (sharply) -- You're not good for me, Bella. \nBella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve. \nEDWARD I've let it go on too long.     I'm sorry. \nTears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes. \nEDWARD I promise, it will be like I never existed. Goodbye, Bella. And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see. \nBy the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins -- \nBELLA -- Wait -- \nShe SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries down the path, then runs -- \nBELLA Edward?! \n-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods... \nA SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING \nBella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS -- \nBELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up, the trees spinning around her... \nSTAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS \nShe remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.       Darkness shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her. \nECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name being called in the distance. A search party. She's too wrecked to respond. \nRain begins to pour; she doesn't register it.... \nSERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper -- \nEDWARD (O.S.) Move, Bella. \nShe lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something else instead -- \nBELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage. \nBella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She closes her eyes, trying to disappear... INT. WOODS - LATER NIGHT \nBella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried... \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nHalf the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black. \nCharlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER, 46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face). \nCHARLIE I'll call the Cullens again. Her note said she and Edward went for a walk. \nBILLY They left town, Charlie. HARRY CLEARWATER Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job somewhere else. \n", "test1_id": 1440, "test2_input": "Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder. \nHARRY CLEARWATER We'll find her, Charlie. \nCharlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends. \nJACOB Charlie! \nCharlie spins to where Jacob points -- \nTHEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS \nSAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella. \nBILLY It's Sam Uley. He found her. \nCharlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life. He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms. \nCHARLIE Thank you, Sam. Thank God. \nCharlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs away, avoiding any accolades. \nON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable, quickly looks away. \nON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house -- \nCHARLIE What were you thinking, Baby?   Why were you out there? \nBELLA He's... gone. \nOff her as Charlie carries her inside -- \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nOVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps her in blankets... A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA \nShe's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed. Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In various different arrangements. Meanwhile... \nA BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed, higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness... \nEXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER \nThe leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the upstairs window -- \nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nBella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her -- \nOCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or- treating. DISSOLVE INTO... \nNOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern... WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare... \nDECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house... worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains unchanged... \nBELLA (V.O.) Dear Mom... I'm... (beat) ... lost... \nPAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone are all traces of Edward... \nBELLA (V.O.) Edward took everything with him. Including my life. He promised it would be like he never existed... \n... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone. INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nBELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee. \nBELLA (V.O.) ... But I need to know he did. \nA SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER: \n-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nBella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie watches her, concerned. \nBELLA (V.O.) It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest... \n-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIn the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor. \nBELLA (V.O.) But the pain is my only reminder that he was real... that they all were... \n-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY \nLunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead.

TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY \nAlice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner. \nCARLISLE No.   We promised Edward. \nALICE But she won't do well without us. I get flashes of her, but they're unclear -- \nROSALIE Forget her, let's drag Edward home. \nESME He'll come back when he's ready. After Bella moves on. \nCARLISLE Yes. When she's living her life, safe from danger -- \nJASPER (with self-contempt) You mean safe from us. \nAlice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly. \nROSALIE (pointedly to Alice) And when will that be? \nEMMETT Can you see him, Alice? They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes, trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as -- \nALICE The only decision he's made... \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY \n(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized. \nALICE (O.S.) ... is to be alone... \n-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below -- Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him -- \nON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the ravine - as they hit ground we -- \nSMASH BACK TO: \nCLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS \n-- as they hit computer keys -- \nBELLA (V.O.)

Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise... \nBella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then she hits \"select all\" and \"delete\" -- \nON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: \"Hi Mom, things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends. Stop worrying. I'm fine.\" \nBella presses \"send\", and the cheery e-mail disappears. Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE... \nAN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW \n-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY \nBella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles. \nCHARLIE It's about time you got rid of those, Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway. \nBOB Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy. (starts off, but stops) Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem? Folks are saying they're huge. \nCHARLIE (distracted) That's just... talk... \n-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.

They gaily head toward the town square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward. \nINTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE -- \nBELLA Why are they all wearing red? \nALICE San Marcos Day festival. The perfect setting. Large crowds. The Volturi won't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he's counting on that. \nBELLA We only have five minutes -- \nAlice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE wave her back.

Don't! \nEdward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind. EDWARD Carlisle was right... heaven... \nBELLA No, I'm here.

They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind him, taking a protective stance in front of her -- \nThey face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower. Out of the alley's shadows emerge -- \nTWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI, slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES. \nEDWARD I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen. \nFELIX Aro wants to speak with you again. \nEDWARD No rules were broken. \nDemetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more gracious of the two. But no less dangerous. \nDEMETRI We should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue. \nEDWARD Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and enjoy the festival? \nFELIX The girl comes with us. \nEDWARD That's not going to happen -- \nALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat. \nALICE Come on, guys, it's a festival. \nShe reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a protective stance, as well. \nALICE We wouldn't want to make a scene. \nFELIX There won't be any scene.    And we'll still win. EDWARD But not easily -- \nJANE (O.S.) Enough. \nA very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES. \nFelix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of this small girl. \nEDWARD (nodding to her) Jane. \nBELLA (sotto to Alice) Who is she? ALICE (sotto to Bella) Just do as she says. \nJane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it. \nJANE Follow me. \nJane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of him. Edward takes Bella's hand... \nEXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY \nJane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow, dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward never loosens his grip on Bella's hand. \nTheir path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK.

{"test1_input": "A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either side of the Rogue's face. Compassion? \nEDWARD (V.O.) We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die. \nAro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF. Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away... \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT \n-- as Bella spins on Edward -- \nBELLA Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else. \nEDWARD (sees she's worried) Who else would hurt me? \nBELLA You said there were more dangerous things out there than you. And I know you have at least one enemy -- \nOFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS: \n-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread- locked LAURENT (from \"Twilight\") \n-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes, feral, vicious grin (from \"Twilight\") \nBELLA (O.S.) You said she'd come after you for killing her mate. \nBACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD \nEDWARD Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win. \nBella looks up at him, pained. \nBELLA I hate that I can't protect you. \nHe laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not. \nBELLA That was me being serious. \nEDWARD (kissing her face) I know. But you do protect me... (kisses her nose) From boredom... (kisses her lips) And loneliness... (in between kisses) You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you... \n-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind -- EDWARD ... from everyone but my sister. \n-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in. \nALICE It's time it's time it's time! \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT \nAlice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then skips down the stairs. They look down into -- \nTHE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful. \nBella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to -- \nTHE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly. CARLISLE Sorry about all this.   We tried to rein Alice in. \nESME Like that's even possible.   Happy birthday, Bella. \nFLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them. \nALICE (re: camera) Found it in your bag.   Mind? \nEmmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him. \nEMMETT Dating an older woman.    Hot. \nBella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up. \nEMMETT What? \nRosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella. \nROSALIE It's a necklace. Alice picked it out. \nShe walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper across the room. They wave to each other. ALICE (aims the camera) Show me the love! \nEdward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into one another's eyes. FLASH! \nALICE For your scrapbook.    Now open your presents! \nAlice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates. \nBELLA Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty. \nALICE Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's from Emmett. The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box. \nBELLA Um... thanks? \nEMMETT Already installed it in your truck. \n", "test1_true": "BELLA No hating on the truck.     Thank you, Emmett. \nALICE Open mine. \nAlice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but -- \nBELLA Ouch - paper cut. \nCLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood appears. \nBella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing, grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as -- \nBELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes beyond reason -- \n-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to CRASH into the table, plates shattering as -- \n-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding. \n-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella. \n-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down -- \nALICE (soothingly) Jaz... shhh -- \n... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella. Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the overwhelming scent -- \nON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards; bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up -- \nBELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION) \nAll of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly ravenous vampires... \nSLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and stands between her and the others. \nCARLISLE Emmett, get Jasper out of here. (no response) Emmett. \nEmmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic -- \nALICE I'm sorry, I... can't... \nShe slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle examines Bella's arm. \nCARLISLE I'll have to stitch this up. \nEDWARD I'll carry her to the kitchen. \nHe moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood. \nCARLISLE I'll take care of her, Edward. (Edward doesn't move) Check on Jasper. Go. \nEdward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes... \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nBella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood. BELLA I sure can kill a party. \nCARLISLE It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us. \nBELLA Seems like you're the only one it doesn't effect. \nCARLISLE Centuries of practice. \nBELLA Did you ever think of... living differently? \nCARLISLE I enjoy   my work too much. Helping people,   saving lives. I'm hoping there's   a point to my existence, even if I am   damned. \nBELLA Damned?    You're not damned. \nCARLISLE Then you and I agree. But Edward doesn't believe there's an afterlife for our kind. (looking at her) He thinks we've lost our souls. \nBELLA (realizing) That's why he won't... He thinks he'd be damning me. \nCARLISLE (CONT'D) If you believed as he did, would you risk it? \nOff Bella, no, not ever... \nINT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT \nA large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard. Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally -- \nBELLA Say something. EDWARD What do you want me to say? \nBELLA That I'm a klutz. That I should have been more careful -- \nEDWARD You got a paper cut. Normal people get paper cuts. And a normal boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend wouldn't have had to fight the urge to kill you -- \n", "test1_id": 1440, "test2_input": "Desolation fills him.   She sees this. \nBELLA It's bad, huh? \nJACOB I just hate feeling... out of control. Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me. \nBELLA Like you could get rid of me. \nJACOB You've seen Emily. \nThat lands with her.   She nods. \nJACOB Sam lost it for a split second; Em was standing too close -- he's still messed up about it. (beat) I don't want to be that kind of nightmare. \nBELLA You're not like that. You save people, right? You saved me from Laurent. \nJACOB Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too. \nBella stops, chilled to the bone. \nBELLA Victoria.     She's here? \nJACOB We chased her all the way to the border the other night. But she won't stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after... (sees Bella's face) ... What? \nBELLA I know what she wants.      Me. SMASH TO: \nEXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY \nA MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a blinding speed -- \nINT. MASERATI - SAME \nCLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her words laced with longing and fury. \nVICTORIA James hated cars. He liked being close to the ground. But I'd steal one occasionally, to throw him off the scent... See, we played hide and seek sometimes. No one can hide like me -- (grins to her passenger) -- but no one could seek like James. \nINCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out. \nDENISE What -- what are you -- ? VICTORIA Some games   lasted months... but we always got   hungry for each other. (sly,   to Denise) So I'd let   him find me... \nDenise now lucid, looks around to SEE -- \nIN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him -- \nDENISE Michael?    Oh my God -- \nVICTORIA We never could get enough of each other... (seething) We would have had forever to try. \nDenise, scared, shakes Michael's arm -- DENISE Michael?! \n-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side, revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins. \nVICTORIA James always loved a screamer. \nVictoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we -- \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY \nON JARED -- \nJARED Excellent. If the redhead's after Bella, we've got bait. \nWith stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head - Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it. \nJACOB She is not bait. \nINCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small, quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam, Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast. \nBELLA I should leave town. \nSAM Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her. \nBELLA No one can catch her.   She can escape anything. \nPAUL Ooh.   She has special powers. \nBELLA Some of them do. \nThey all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it. JACOB Like... what? Bella? \nJARED The mind reader you said you knew. He was a suckhead? Can they all do that? \nEMBRY That would blow. \nBELLA No, I -- shouldn't have - no. \n", "test2_true": "JARED I don't know why. It's not like they stuck around to protect you -- \nJACOB Guys, back off. \nJacob looks apologetically at Bella.   She shrinks, stung. \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJacob walks her to the door. \nJACOB Don't worry, we've got this place covered. She won't get near you or Charlie. \nBella nods.   He sees she's blue. \nJACOB Hey, we should do something fun. Like... cliff diving, right? \nBELLA I could use the rush. \nJACOB Soon.   After we catch her. \nHe offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods. \nEXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT \nBella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home. She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door... \nINT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm, candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper. \nBella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them. \nBELLA You're here. \nBut they ignore her. Won't even look at her.      She starts toward them but suddenly -- \nEdward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door and pushing her out, slamming it on her -- \nEXT. CULLEN HOUSE - (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \n-- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward -- \nINT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING \nBella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But it stays with her... \nEXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY \nBella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her. EMILY Bella.   Are you okay? \nBELLA Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He wasn't at home... \nSam appears behind Emily. \nSAM He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an eye on things. I'm heading out soon. Should I tell him something? \n-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is achingly obvious. Off Bella's face -- \nFLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture -- \nBACK ON BELLA - pained. EMILY You want to come in? \n-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination on her face. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nCLOSE ON A RIFLE as it locks and loads. INCLUDE CHARLIE, who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the end of the line, pausing, looking down. \nCHARLIE You got something, Harry? \nON HARRY - he looks down at a large WOLF PAW PRINT. \nHARRY CLEARWATER Nope, nothin'. \nThe hunting party moves forward.   Harry lets them get ahead, stomps out the paw print. \nON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree -- \nWHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare. \nShe noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready to pounce on Charlie -- ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES -- \nShe HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.    Before Harry can raise his shotgun -- \nVictoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly -- \nTHE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her away. She rights herself immediately and takes off -- \n", "test2_id": 1441, "test3_input": "THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing.

ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME \nLIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest -- \nBACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side -- \nSMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she bursts out of the trees to -- \nEXT.

Off Charlie beginning CPR... \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY \nBella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down -- \nBELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps. \nEDWARD (O.S.) Step back. \nBella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She turns to find Edward's apparition at her side. \nShe steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to disappear. \nThat's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat, adrenaline pumping -- \nEdward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going -- \nEDWARD Stop this now, Bella. \nBELLA You won't stay with me any other way. \nShe takes a last look at him... then with a running leap -- FLINGS herself over the edge -- \nON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down, down... then SPLASHES into the water. EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY \nNo sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up. Inhales deeply -- and laughs! \nBELLA Yes! \nShe enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes how strong the current is... \nA WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under... \nUNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles -- \nABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES -- \nBELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish, bobbing on the surface of the water -- \nBella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing is suddenly thirty yards closer. \nBella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks. \nANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips below the surface, vanishing... UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love. He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR -- \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nCLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious. \nJACOB Breathe, Bella! C'mon! \nJacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to. \nJACOB Bella?   Can you hear me? \nBELLA ... Jake? She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved. Behind him stands Sam. \nSAM She'll be alright. \nSam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something. \nJACOB What the hell were you thinking? \nBELLA I needed... to see... something. \n", "test3_true": "SAM Get her home. I'm heading to the hospital. I'll meet you there. \nJacob nods.   Sam jogs off. \nJACOB Why would you jump? Didn't you notice it's like a hurricane out here? \nBELLA I know. It was stupid -- (realizing) -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt? \nJACOB Harry Clearwater had a heart attack. \nBELLA Oh my God - does my Dad know? \nJACOB He and my dad are both over there. \nBELLA Will Harry be okay? \nJACOB I don't know. Come on. I'll find you something dry and drive you home. \nAs Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to -- \nANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface. \nINT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT \nJacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her -- \nJACOB Hundred and eight degrees over here. \nShe tucks herself into him. \nBELLA Must be nice, never getting cold. \nJACOB It's a wolf thing. \nBELLA It's a Jacob thing.   You're just... warm. \nJACOB (grins) Like the sun. \nBELLA (meaning it) Like the sun. \nJACOB Which always comes back.   You can count on me. \nShe nods.   Awkward silence.   He fills it. \nJACOB There are other cool things about all this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see me stab my hand? \nBELLA (no!) Yeah, `cause that would be fun. \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT \nThe truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside. Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off. \nBELLA So... this wolf thing's not all bad? JACOB It's better. Now that you know. But... \nBELLA ... but... \nJACOB It just... comes so easily to me. More than the other guys. \nBELLA That's a good thing, isn't it? \nJACOB Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less... human than the others. (beat, quieter) Sometimes I'm scared I might... disappear, you know? Who I really am. \nBella faces him, looks directly in his eyes. \nBELLA I won't let that happen. \nTheir faces are close... and stay close for an intimate beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks herself back to reality and pulls away. BELLA Thanks for driving - for everything. \n-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob reacts to a repugnant smell outside -- \nJACOB Holy crap -- ! \nHe abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door shut and starts the truck. \nJACOB There's a bloodsucker out there. \nBELLA How do you know? \nJACOB I can smell the stink.   I'm getting you out of here. As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE -- \nBELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in front.

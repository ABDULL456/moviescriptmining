Machete points to the hole in his shoulder. 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Wait, you want this gunk squirted in there...I don't... 
Machete takes a swig of Tequila. 
MACHETE Do it. 
ELEKTRA I....can't. 
She takes a swig, pops a pill and stares at the bloody hole. 
She holds her arm up ready... 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Fuck. 
She JAMS the baster in. The fluid squirts in the hole and SIZZLES. 
Elektra watches in awe as dark green fluid dribbles out of the wound, followed by a thick yellow goo with veins and lumps of flesh. 
It bubbles like a volcano, she peers in and suddenly... 
It BURSTS and SPRAYS pus and flesh chunks all over her. 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Ahhhh! 
Elektra runs screaming into the bathroom. 
INT. CHURCH, INNER ROOM 
April and June rouse from two small cots in a drugged and drunken stupor. They're surprised to find they're naked in a windowless room. There's a small webcam in a corner. 
APRIL Mom? Where are we? I'm scared. 
JUNE Me, too, honey. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 58. 
APRIL What is this place? 
POV: WEBCAM. Grainy B&W image. 
They embrace, huddle. 
INT. BUNGALOW- NIGHT 
Elektra walks out in a hot new outfit, blow drying her hair. 
ELEKTRA That was disgusting. 
Machete smashes knife handles off and fits the blades into a belt under his jacket. 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Do you mind not breaking knives in the house? It's kind of one of my rules. I mean... 
Elektra's phone rings. It's Boss. 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Oh shit. All right. I'm going to tell him what you told me. Wish me luck. 
MACHETE Luck. 
ELEKTRA (ANSWERING PHONE) Yeah. 
BOSS (ON PHONE) Where the hell have you been? 
ELEKTRA I had a little fender bender. 
BOSS (ON PHONE) Goddamnit! I said where have you been? 
ELEKTRA Calm down! I have him right now. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 59. 
BOSS (ON PHONE) You do? 
ELEKTRA Yes, but it's complicated. He's innocent. Sort of.

BOB (Coming into scene) Father... 
GROUCHO (Looks up and sees Bob... without being a bit disturbed... remains on her lap) Take a letter... 
Bob takes out pad and pencil. 
BOB Who to? 
GROUCHO None of your business...  Take another letter. 
Groucho rises to his feet and paces the floor in the manner of a studious business man with his hands behind his back... then starts to dictate as Bob writes on his pad. 
GROUCHO Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight -- (Turns to Mrs. Teasdale) Gloria, I could go for you in a big way -- (turns to Bob) However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty -- (Then to Mrs. Teasdale) -- and I don't say that to everybody -- (Now to Bob) Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come? (To Mrs. Teasdale) Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. (Dashes back to Mrs. Teasdale's lap) 
BOB (Reading from pad) Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly... 
GROUCHO (Rising to his feet) They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too. 
BOB Yes, sir. (Exits from scene) 
GROUCHO (Turning to Mrs. Teasdale) Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here. 
MRS. TEASDALE Well, if you must go -- 
She picks up Groucho's hat and hands it to him.  He removes a white rabbit from hat and gives it to her.  He is about to put the hat on his head when something in the hat attracts his attention.  He empties six baby rabbits out of the hat onto the table; puts his hat on and exits. 
CUT TO outside of house just as Harpo is pulling up to the curb in his motorcycle and sidecar.  Groucho comes out of house and walks directly to motorcycle. 
GROUCHO (To Harpo) I'm not taking any more chances. You sit in the sidecar... 
Harpo gets off seat and sits in sidecar.  Groucho sits on driver's seat.  The sound of the motor is heard and Harpo drives off in the sidecar, leaving Groucho on the motorcycle.

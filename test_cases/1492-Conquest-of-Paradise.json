{"test1_input": "EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER \nThe CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of FERNANDO. \nCOLUMBUS Be good to your mother, Fernando. Do you promise? \nFERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear. \nBEATRIX Speak to Diego. \nBut COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS' shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly, they hug. \nCUT TO: \nActivity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying... BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them. \nCOLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and throws it at DIEGO. \nCOLUMBUS Diego!  Here! \nDIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated. \nTHE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY. SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS. \nSANTANGEL (casually) Take care of my investment, wherever you're going! \nCOLUMBUS (ambiguous) I have to tell you Santangel.  I don't know where on earth I am going! \nThey both laugh. \nA FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the SAILORS leaning on the rail. \nSAILOR Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!) \nThey wave back. \nCUT TO: \nMARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally turns, sad and distraught.  He sees: \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY \nTHREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN. \nThe sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath. A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety of the crew, the fear of the unknown... \nENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging majestically through the waves.  Sinking back, disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nA SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck. \nA SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast. \nA COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of the evening meal. \nTEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail, punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT \nThe crystalline north star -- as if seen through an instrument. \nCOLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars. \nSOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque. \nNear COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him. \nCOLUMBUS (softly) Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us... \nMENDEZ God be with us admiral. \nMENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS. \nCOLUMBUS What is it Mendez?  Speak! \nMENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat. \n", "test1_true": "COLUMBUS (still taking readings) And what do you think Mendez? \nMENDEZ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before. \nCOLUMBUS Come over here. \nMENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation. \nCOLUMBUS Now, find the North Star.  Do you have it? \nCUT TO: \nThe picture swims across the heavens, until we see the north star. \nCOLUMBUS (O.S.) Steady yourself...!  Keep the plumb line vertical... \nThe picture steadies. \nCUT TO: \nMENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line swings. \nCOLUMBUS Don't move!  A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 6,000 leagues! \nMENDEZ tries again. \nCOLUMBUS What do you read? \nMENDEZ Twenty eight. \nMENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS. \nCOLUMBUS That's it.  The twenty eighth parallel.  And we'll follow it until we reach land. \nALONSO does not seem convinced. \nALONSO How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel? \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nA blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the air shimmer over the decks. \nDesperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the sagging prow sail. \nThe SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO watches him. \nALONSO Chicken-ass face! \nThe others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them. ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he reacts like he was burnt. \nALONSO Shit! \nHe sucks his blistered fingers. \nALONSO I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas! \nSAILOR The water's going putrid in the barrels. \nALONSO You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard! \nThe SHIP'S BOY glances round at them. \nALONSO What are you listening to, chicken ass? \nSAILOR Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm. \nALONSO With a face like that? (to boy) I don't want you looking at me.  You hear? \nThe BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea. \nALONSO He's the devil's child... \nSAILOR We'll all go crazy... \nThe BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song. \nSAILOR Culo de galina es el hijo del demonio... (Chicken ass mouth is the devil's child... Born from the loins of a stinky old goat etc...) \nThey all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the crow's-nest like a monkey. \n", "test1_id": 684, "test2_input": "EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY \nWe experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast, high above the rolling deck. \nThe BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest, exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning white.  He begins to piss himself... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nPiss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue their bitter conversation. \nALONSO We should have seen land. \nSAILOR We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near. \nALONSO Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign... \nThe COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him. \nCOOK (shaking his head) Of course it smells like it!  That's why sailors take to the sea! \nThey all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear. \nALONSO And why does this one take to the sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a word... \nMENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He approaches them. \nMENDEZ To your post!  At once! \nThey split in silence. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT \nThe SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS sleep on deck. \nThe SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair lip he has a pure, melancholy voice... \nCOLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears it carry over the darkness. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nCLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time. \nThe SHIP'S BOY throws an \"ampoulette\" over board.  We follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another SAILOR shouts \"MARK\".  A very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed. \nSitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in a log-book, watching the hourglass. \nSHIP'S BOY Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir! \nTHE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed. \nCOLUMBUS Six hundred and twenty nine. \nTHE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PINTA - DAY \nPINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA MARIA. \nSHIP'S BOY Six hundred and twenty nine! \nAN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message. \nOFFICER Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir! \nPINZON does not seem too pleased. \nPINZON I heard. \nTHE OFFICER examines his own calculations. \nOFFICER Captain, I don't understand. \nPINZON I think I do. \nHe goes back to his cabin. \n", "test2_true": "EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY \nABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed. \nThe caravels are being towed by three rowing boats. \nCLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat. \nFROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon. \nALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant figure with hate and resentment. \nALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat into disarray.  Chaos. \nTotal silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other. \nMENDEZ Continue rowing! \nALONSO To where? \nALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls. \nMENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic. \nON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his mouth. \nOFFICER Captain Pinzon requests permission to board. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY \nCOLUMBUS Granted. \nINT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY \nPINZON enters.  He looks furious. \nPINZON You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues! \nCOLUMBUS (calmly) Six days ago, yes. \nPINZON You must be mad...! \nCOLUMBUS We have to keep the hopes of these men alive! \nPINZON We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon! \nCOLUMBUS You think I don't know that? \nPINZON We're lost! \nCOLUMBUS The land is there.  I know it! \nPINZON You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back! \nCOLUMBUS And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that! \nPINZON (apoplectic) Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you! \nCOLUMBUS You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember? \nPINZON You bloody... \nCOLUMBUS Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that! \nPINZON You tell that to them! \nCOLUMBUS You're right.  Let the men decide. \nCOLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nMost of the men are now back on board. \nThey go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening... \nCOLUMBUS Who gave you the order to come on board? \n", "test2_id": 685, "test3_input": "COLUMBUS They come and go as naked as the day God created them... \nISABEL blushes slightly. \nCOLUMBUS They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And... \nSANCHEZ (interrupting) Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold? \nCOLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back. \nCOLUMBUS These are gifts for Your Majesty. \nISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside.  She takes out some of the little golden ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask. \nShe holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty. \nISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at COLUMBUS. \nThe image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask. \nISABEL We are more than gratified. \nThe guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little -- looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at him, coldly. \nINT.  ROTUNDA - DAY \nA SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not see, and comments his movements. \nMASTER Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente! (Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!) \nWe discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade. \nOut of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return. \nCOLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages. SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a glass. \nSANCHEZ You defend yourself admirably... \nCOLUMBUS ... for a commoner? \nSANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass. \nSANCHEZ To your second expedition. \nThey drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of imposing energy, approach them. \nSANCHEZ Don Colon -- Don Alonso de Bobadilla.  A man who knows our laws. \nBOBADILLA bows. \nBOBADILLA I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so? \nCOLUMBUS Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. \nBOBADILLA (disappointed) May I ask by whom? \nCOLUMBUS Bartolome and Giacomo Colon. \nSANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens. \nBOBADILLA I trust they are men of quality. \nBOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ. \nCOLUMBUS But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration. \nSANCHEZ (amused) Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal. \nCOLUMBUS Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves! \nA grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA. \nBOBADILLA (to Sanchez) I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon has no need for my services... \nAnd he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of ham. \nSANCHEZ (amused) You seem to have a special talent for making friends. \nCOLUMBUS What...?  Do I have so many already? \n", "test3_true": "INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY \nCOLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS' brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful. \nBARTOLOME You might have given us a choice! \nGIACOMO Bartolome is stronger, more capable than I will ever be... \nCOLUMBUS I need both of you.  What are you afraid of?  We are living what we always dreamt of. \nGIACOMO You know I never shared those dreams with you. \nCOLUMBUS Are you saying you refuse to help? \nCOLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise... \nBARTOLOME (amused) You bastard... you always had your own way... \nCOLUMBUS Let me show you something. \nHe opens the door to a terrace. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  GALLERY - DAY \nThe large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE -- applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint. They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there... \nCOLUMBUS Of course... Of course... We'll see to it... Yes... Thank you... Soon... Soon... \nFighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way, reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS, MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second expedition. \nCOLUMBUS puts his arms around them. \nCOLUMBUS (indicating the applicants) Now -- you tell me.  Who can I trust? (almost amused) We're brothers!  We must be a House. A bloodline!  In this country one can't exist alone!  I need you...! Both of you! \nHe walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants begin to look up, aware of his presence. \nSOLDIER Where is the Admiral?  Has anyone seen the Admiral? \nEverybody laughs. \nCOLUMBUS He is here!  What is it? \nHe leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is brandishing a document. \nMAN Admiral!  The horses have arrived. \nCOLUMBUS I know.  I saw them!  Who did we hire today? \nANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes. \nASSISTANT Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a hundred farmers, twenty miners... and Doctor Chanca, the royal surgeon. \nCOLUMBUS The royal surgeon?  Then we can count on royal health! \nThe whole courtyard bursts out laughing. \nEXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY \nUTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over. UTAPAN falls to the ground. \nCOLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX. \nCOLUMBUS (looking at his son) He's growing up! \nBEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on. \nCOLUMBUS Beatrix, I want to ask you something. \nBEATRIX (with a smile) You don't usually ask. \nCOLUMBUS (after a pause) I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service. \nBEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him. \nCOLUMBUS It is a great honor.  We could not hope for anything better. \nBEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at FERNANDO. \n", "test3_id": 686}

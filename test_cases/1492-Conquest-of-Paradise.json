{"train": "1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE \n1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE \nby \nRoselyne Bosch \nREVISED \nSeptember 23, 1991 \nFADE IN: \nCREDITS AND MUSIC OVER: \nINT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY \nWe start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing on marble floors. \nCUT TO: \nA Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion, dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is TREASURER SANCHEZ. \nA door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We can now here a subdued conversation. \nTREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as: \nThe door opens at the far end of the large gilded room. A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him. \nHe bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and three dignitaries of Church and State. \nAll sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document and starts to read aloud. \nOn screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500 \nSANCHEZ Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island.  You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us -- the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining. \nSANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully. \nSANCHEZ From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island.  He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him.  He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty.  What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. Is that not so, Brother Buyl? \nThe PRIEST nods. \nBROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Honor. \nSANCHEZ He promised gold.  Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute.  Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties... \nISABEL lowers her eyes. \nSANCHEZ Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians. \nISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL. \nISABEL Could it be so? \nBROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Majesty. \nSANCHEZ But there is worse.  From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery.  When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment... (he pauses) ... he was executed. (pause) Is that not true also, Brother Buyl? \nBROTHER BUYL Yes, Your Honor.  It is all true. All of it.  I saw it with my own eyes. \nSANCHEZ He has lost control.  His great arrogance has led him into depravity.  He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors. \nSilence. \nISABEL Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez? \nSANCHEZ Yes, Your Majesty. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY \nCLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed, sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away. There is a dripping sound of water. \nFERNANDO (V.O.) Of all the words my Father wrote and there were many, I remember these the most.  \"Nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent...\" \nRain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A lizard scuttles into the shadows. \nMARCHENA (fumbles in a pocket under his robe) I have something for you. \nAlmost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter. \nMARCHENA You will be heard at the University of Salamanca... \nCOLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes. \nCOLUMBUS God... That's in a week! \nMARCHENA That's what it says. \nCOLUMBUS How did you manage it? \nMARCHENA (smiling) With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool. \nMARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel. \nINT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY \nMARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an inquiring mind. \nWith practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath. \nWhen he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression.  He turns over an hourglass. \nMARCHENA Why do you wish to sail west? \nCOLUMBUS To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it... \nHe leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the desk. \nCOLUMBUS By sea, sailing around the African Continent -- the journey takes a year... \nHis finger traces the journey, from west to east. \nCOLUMBUS Or by land... \nWe are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between Europe and the Far East. \nCOLUMBUS (O.S.) ... But the Turks have closed this route to all Christians.  Trading with the Orient has become arduous, if not dangerous. (he pauses) There is a third way... \nWe notice that the outline of the European continent is familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse of ocean, the whole American continent is missing. \nCOLUMBUS By sailing West across the Ocean Sea. \nCLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery. \nMARCHENA How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite. \nCOLUMBUS Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands. \nMARCHENA How can you be so certain? \nCOLUMBUS The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras... \nMARCHENA (interrupting) Esdras is a Jew. \nCOLUMBUS So was Christ! \nMARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He glances at the hourglass: \nMARCHENA Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon. \nCOLUMBUS (mockingly) I'll try to remember that, Marchena... \nMARCHENA Father Marchena! \nCOLUMBUS (ignoring this) Passion is something one cannot control! \nMARCHENA (heatedly) You get so carried away when you are being contradicted! \nCOLUMBUS I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity! \nMARCHENA (amused) Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son. \nEXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING \nDIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to go. \nThey are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks over at BEATRIX. \nCOLUMBUS Fernando, don't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman? \nHe winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles. \nINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her skin.  She flinches, murmurs... \nThey make love. \nEXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY \nA medieval \"campus\".  Students-novices are playing \"pelote\", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to their class. \nWe find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes from a door, and looks around the group. \nMONK (hesitant) Christopher Columbus? \nINT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY \nAn El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in bourgeois outfits. \nOnly one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers. \nAROJAZ You say Asia can be found by sailing west? \nCOLUMBUS Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks. \nAROJAZ Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... (pause) Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus? \nCOLUMBUS I am, Your Eminence \nAROJAZ Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... (he leans forward) 22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable. \nHe leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect. \nAROJAZ But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken! \nA ripple of mirthless laughter. \nCOLUMBUS Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr? \nHERNANDO DE TALAVERA We are. \nCOLUMBUS Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus... De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues... \nA murmur of protest spreads among the members of the Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his theories. \nCOLUMBUS The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations.  And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed. \nIndignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his voice to quiet the assembly. \nDIEGO DE DEZA Gentlemen, let us suppose Marin de Tyr is right... (the laughter subsides) Are we here to examine this proposal or not? \nSilence. \nDIEGO DE DEZA (to Columbus) In your opinion, how long would the voyage be? \nCOLUMBUS Seven weeks.  Six, during the summer months. \nThe murmur increases. \nAROJAZ Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a year! \nA MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as being a seaman, interrupts. \nVICUNA How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? Water is undrinkable after six weeks!  You'd never be able to turn back! \nCOLUMBUS We wouldn't have to turn back!  We would find land at this point! \nAROJAZ Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment. \nCOLUMBUS Excellency, you are right. \nInstantly, the protests stop. \nCOLUMBUS I am a seaman, not a scholar... But as a simple man craving for knowledge, I have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean... \nSANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry. \nSANCHEZ You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so effortlessly... \nHe offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter, pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table, leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass. \nSANCHEZ ... can so easily be taken away. \nAnd he drinks with a smile. \nINT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING \nMARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter. \nMARCHENA ... and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical... if not impossible. \nHe shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks appalled; devastated. \nCOLUMBUS They didn't listen.  They didn't want to listen! \nHe paces about the book-lined room. \nMARCHENA You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait. \nCOLUMBUS Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait? \nMARCHENA If God intends you to go, then you will go. \nCOLUMBUS (angrily) Damn God! \nMARCHENA is shocked. \nMARCHENA Colon! \nCOLUMBUS Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! \nHe seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk. \nCOLUMBUS These don't mean anything!  They're full of assumptions!  Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens! \nHe hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified. \nMARCHENA No...!  My books...! \nCOLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping them to the floor. \nCOLUMBUS All of them!  Just lies! \nMARCHENA Colon!  Don't! \nMARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room. \nAs COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends COLUMBUS crashing to the floor. \nINT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING \nCOLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him. \nFERNANDO Father? \nDIEGO Sssshhhh...!  One can't speak to a man doing penance. \nFERNANDO What can you do? \nDIEGO Nothing.  That's the point, Fernando. \nA pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to join them. \nEXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY \nAlong the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition. Another MONK works nearby, in silence. \nPINZON (O.S.) Senor Colon? \nCOLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a middle-class gentleman.  He nods. \nPINZON Ah, thank God!  I've been looking all over Seville for you!  Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh? \nHe laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything. PINZON is clearly a little surprised. \nINT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY \nAn ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand. We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades, mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of Granada's rooftops. \nAgainst this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS falls to his knees. \nISABEL Rise...!  Come forward! \nHe approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL scrutinizes him quickly. \nISABEL I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool. \nCOLUMBUS (bold) No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors. \nISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness. \nISABEL The ocean is uncrossable? \nCOLUMBUS What did they say about Granada before today? \nISABEL (a beat) That she was impregnable. \nISABEL smiles again. \nISABEL I cannot ignore the verdict of my council. \nCOLUMBUS Surely you can do anything you want. \nA direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this man. \nISABEL How little you know. \nThis little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her. \nCOLUMBUS May I speak freely? \nISABEL (with a smile) You show no inclination to speak otherwise! \nCOLUMBUS I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... \"What if?\"... \nISABEL (amused at his familiarity) A woman? \nA slight pause. \nCOLUMBUS Forgive me... but you're the only Queen I know. \nShe bursts out laughing. \nISABEL Then we are equal... since you are the only sailor I know! \nA beat. \nISABEL How old are you, Senor Colon? \nCOLUMBUS Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you? \nOnce again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it. \nISABEL Thirty eight... \nA pause. \nISABEL You will be informed of our decision. \nCOLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the door for him, he turns back. \nCOLUMBUS Actually, I thought you were younger than me! \nAnd he goes out, leaving her stunned. \nEXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY \nA chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large silver tray, the other a smaller tray. \nThey are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along the road, with documents under his arm. \nEXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY \nThe CLERK enters an imposing stable block. \nCOLUMBUS If you can do that, Excellency -- I'll become a monk! \nHe turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S muffled laughter. \nAs COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret door.  SANCHEZ bows. \nISABEL goes over to the window and looks out. \nISABEL You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted. \nSANCHEZ Never, Your Majesty.  Although... \nShe turns, questioningly, towards him. \nSANCHEZ ... Although one may always renegotiate a contract.  Especially signed by Royal Hands. \nEXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY \nSANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS striding out and away. \nINT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY \nBACK TO SANCHEZ \nSANCHEZ (quietly) ... Into a monk... \nISABEL (with a smile) Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it? (turning to Sanchez) Call him back! \nEXT.  STREET - EVENING \nTeeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds. He is expressionless and distracted. \nHe looks around him, stops walking.  And then, unexpectedly, shouts. \nCOLUMBUS YEEEEEEES! \nAll heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on as if nothing happened. \nINT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nCOLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt. \nCOLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad. \nCOLUMBUS She said yes. \nBEATRIX (moved) Thank God... \nShe smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her happiness. \nCOLUMBUS If I ever come back, I swear I will... \nShe crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his mouth. \nBEATRIX (softly) I'm not asking you to swear to anything. \nCOLUMBUS I don't want you to wait for me. \nBEATRIX (smiling) That's something you can't decide. \nCOLUMBUS kisses her. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nStrange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks slowly down the dark corridor. \nQuietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study. \nINT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal. \nSitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map. \nFERNANDO (O.S.) You can't go there! \nTurning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him. \nCOLUMBUS Why not? \nEXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER \nThe CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of FERNANDO. \nCOLUMBUS Be good to your mother, Fernando. Do you promise? \nFERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear. \nBEATRIX Speak to Diego. \nBut COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS' shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly, they hug. \nCUT TO: \nActivity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying... BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them. \nCOLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and throws it at DIEGO. \nCOLUMBUS Diego!  Here! \nDIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated. \nTHE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY. SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS. \nSANTANGEL (casually) Take care of my investment, wherever you're going! \nCOLUMBUS (ambiguous) I have to tell you Santangel.  I don't know where on earth I am going! \nThey both laugh. \nA FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the SAILORS leaning on the rail. \nSAILOR Vaya con Dios!  (Go with God!) \nThey wave back. \nCUT TO: \nMARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally turns, sad and distraught.  He sees: \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY \nTHREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN. \nThe sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath. A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety of the crew, the fear of the unknown... \nENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging majestically through the waves.  Sinking back, disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music. \nEXT.  DECK - DAY \nA SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck. \nA SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast. \nA COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of the evening meal. \nTEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail, punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT \nThe crystalline north star -- as if seen through an instrument. \nCOLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars. \nSOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque. \nNear COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him. \nCOLUMBUS (softly) Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us... \nMENDEZ God be with us admiral. \nMENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS. \nCOLUMBUS What is it Mendez?  Speak! \nMENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY \nWe experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast, high above the rolling deck. \nThe BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest, exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning white.  He begins to piss himself... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nPiss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue their bitter conversation. \nALONSO We should have seen land. \nSAILOR We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near. \nALONSO Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign... \nThe COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him. \nCOOK (shaking his head) Of course it smells like it!  That's why sailors take to the sea! \nThey all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear. \nALONSO And why does this one take to the sea?  Nobody knows.  Never says a word... \nMENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He approaches them. \nMENDEZ To your post!  At once! \nThey split in silence. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT \nThe SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS sleep on deck. \nThe SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair lip he has a pure, melancholy voice... \nCOLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears it carry over the darkness. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nCLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time. \nThe SHIP'S BOY throws an \"ampoulette\" over board.  We follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another SAILOR shouts \"MARK\".  A very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed. \nSitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in a log-book, watching the hourglass. \nSHIP'S BOY Mark.  Twenty nine, Sir! \nTHE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed. \nCOLUMBUS Six hundred and twenty nine. \nTHE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PINTA - DAY \nPINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA MARIA. \nSHIP'S BOY Six hundred and twenty nine! \nAN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message. \nOFFICER Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir! \nPINZON does not seem too pleased. \nPINZON I heard. \nTHE OFFICER examines his own calculations. \nOFFICER Captain, I don't understand. \nPINZON I think I do. \nHe goes back to his cabin. \nHe looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They stare at one another. \nALONSO God doesn't want us to cross the ocean...!  This voyage is cursed! \nSome of the MEN murmur their agreement. \nCOLUMBUS Cursed? \nALONSO We set sail for greed.  God has abandoned us.  The voyage is cursed. There are signs... \nALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip. The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO. \nCOLUMBUS This boy has the voice of an angel. What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso.  What comes out of your is evil. \nSome of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN. \nCOLUMBUS Listen to me!  Every man is afraid who does something for the first time.  But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards.  I do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean -- but I am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts... \nThe MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of mood... \nCOLUMBUS This jacket to the first man who sights land!  I want a man up that mast day and night. \nCOLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY. \nCOLUMBUS You start first. \nThe SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to move under their feet. \nThis movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers. \nMENDEZ Alonso!  Jaime!  Don't let this wind escape us. \nCRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief. \nPINZON (murmuring) You lucky bastard... \nCOLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to PINZON. \nCOLUMBUS Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier I get. \nTurning abruptly, he enters his cabin. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT \nCOLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him with a bowl of soup. \nMENDEZ Shall I take my turn? \nCOLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the bowl. \nCUT TO: \nCOLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face. \nA mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT \nIn the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy. \nCOLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see the land that must be close. \nHe kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his shoulder. \nCOLUMBUS (murmuring) Mendez!  Mendez! \nMENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye. \nCOLUMBUS Land... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SHIP - DAWN \nAn opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the rail, and standing on the shrouds. \nSuddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion. \nSHIP'S BOY TIERRA...!  TIERRA! \nThe INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first... and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine... \nDogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle their babies.  The MEN are entranced. \nPINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He points to it, indicates his interest in it. \nPINZON Gold...!  Gold! \nThe INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing. We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold ornaments. \nPINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON, who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods -- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN from taking it. \nCOLUMBUS (to Pinzon) Give it to him! \nPINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the INDIAN. \nPINZON (irritated) By God!  That's the worst trade of my life! \nHis friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN laughs. \nJust outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN. \nINT.  TENT - DAWN \nThe first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal. \nCOLUMBUS (V.O.) October 21st, 1492.  I think we have returned to Eden.  Surely this is how the world once was, before the beginning of time.  I believe no man will ever see this land again as we do, for the first time... \nHe looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the margin of his log-book.  He draws well. \nHe gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship. \nUTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he wishes to offer. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING \nUTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS follows him. \nUTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come, UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same. \nA gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering. Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS discovers -- \nA large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for? \nCOLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills his palms with liquid gold. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  RIVER - DAY \nWide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream. \nINDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft. THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we notice that some other crew members are beardless, some even wearing tribal patterns. \nEXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY \nINDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON. \nUTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no, indicating another distant place. \nOLD INDIAN Cuba!  Cuba! \nTHE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away to UTAPAN. \nUTAPAN Say not here!  Cuba! \nCOLUMBUS What is it?  A tribe?  An island? \nUTAPAN Island.  Far. \nEXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY \nStanding at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed. \nEXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY \nLed by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem somehow more sinister... \nCUT TO: \nCOLUMBUS Tell the Chief we thank him. \nUTAPAN Chief knows. \nCOLUMBUS Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort. \nUTAPAN translates. \nCOLUMBUS Tell him we will return very soon. Many of us. \nUTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple question. \nUTAPAN Chief says -- how many? \nCOLUMBUS Thousands. \nUTAPAN Why? \nCOLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the first time he seems to be caught short. \nCOLUMBUS To bring the word of God. \nUTAPAN Chief says -- he has a God. \nCOLUMBUS (pursuing) ... and also to bring medicine. \nUTAPAN Chief says... \nCOLUMBUS (interrupting) He has medicine. (pause) Tell him we admire his people. \nUTAPAN translates. \nUTAPAN Chief says he knows you like his... (searches for the word) Women... \nAnd the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving COLUMBUS alone. \nCOLUMBUS (with a little smile) That's a beginning... \nEXT.  SHORE - DAY \nWatched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull out towards the two remaining ships. \nPINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS, UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat. \nCOLUMBUS (V.O.) March 1493... Thirty nine of my men volunteered to stay behind.  God willing we will be back in less than a year... \nThe boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore growing smaller. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty in his log-book. \nCOLUMBUS (V.O.) ... Several men are ill.  We did not find signs of civilization.  No cities, no temples... Nothing that resembles Marco Polo's descriptions. My ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that Spain was hoping for.  But this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes... And all I can think of, is to return to these untamed lands... \nSuddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls. \nEXT.  SEA - NIGHT \nWe are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the massive seas. \nEXT.  DECK - NIGHT \nFive MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack. Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard above the storm. \nCOLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a lifeline. \nCOLUMBUS (screaming to the sailors) Get below!  All of you!  Go! \nThe MEN start to scramble below decks. \nCOLUMBUS (to Mendez) Stay with me! \nThe ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The wood groans. \nCOLUMBUS We may have to cut it! \nMENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment. \nCOLUMBUS They come and go as naked as the day God created them... \nISABEL blushes slightly. \nCOLUMBUS They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And... \nSANCHEZ (interrupting) Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold? \nCOLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back. \nCOLUMBUS These are gifts for Your Majesty. \nISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside.  She takes out some of the little golden ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask. \nShe holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty. \nISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at COLUMBUS. \nThe image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask. \nISABEL We are more than gratified. \nThe guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little -- looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at him, coldly. \nINT.  ROTUNDA - DAY \nA SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not see, and comments his movements. \nMASTER Si!  Si!  Muy bien!  Excellente! (Yes!  Yes!  Good!  Excellent!) \nWe discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade. \nOut of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return. \nCOLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages. SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a glass. \nSANCHEZ You defend yourself admirably... \nCOLUMBUS ... for a commoner? \nSANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass. \nSANCHEZ To your second expedition. \nThey drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of imposing energy, approach them. \nSANCHEZ Don Colon -- Don Alonso de Bobadilla.  A man who knows our laws. \nBOBADILLA bows. \nBOBADILLA I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so? \nCOLUMBUS Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken. \nBOBADILLA (disappointed) May I ask by whom? \nCOLUMBUS Bartolome and Giacomo Colon. \nSANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens. \nBOBADILLA I trust they are men of quality. \nBOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ. \nCOLUMBUS But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration. \nSANCHEZ (amused) Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal. \nCOLUMBUS Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves! \nA grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA. \nBOBADILLA (to Sanchez) I see I was mistaken.  Don Colon has no need for my services... \nAnd he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of ham. \nSANCHEZ (amused) You seem to have a special talent for making friends. \nCOLUMBUS What...?  Do I have so many already? \nBEATRIX For once I wish you weren't right. \nCOLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her closer, they move away. \nEXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY \nFERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes pensive. \nWe become aware of the rustling of the jungle. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY \nFIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS, and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN. \nMOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand.  All are waiting. \nA signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle. Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the MEN they left behind. \nCOLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ. \nMENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer. \nMOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning out as they do so, weapons at the ready. \nEXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY \nRuins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the flight. \nIn silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the devastation. \nThe ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled to the brim with gold. \nBut of the living, there is no sign. \nMOXICA Is this your new world, Don Colon? \nCOLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN, HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword. \nGUEVARA These animals should be shown what savagery can be! \nOther SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word. \nNOBLEMAN Three heads for every life taken. No mercy before God! \nGUEVARA No mercy!  Let's find them. \nCOLUMBUS No Guevara.  There will be no revenge. \nSilence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS. \nMOXICA We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood. \nCOLUMBUS If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say. \nThey are all listening. \nCOLUMBUS Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty nine brave men who trusted me. \nHe walks among them. \nCOLUMBUS You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe? \nMOXICA We don't need to know. \nCOLUMBUS We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for. \nEXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY \nMOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything living. \nAll we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously. \nUTAPAN calls out in dialect. \nUTAPAN They here. \nSlowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared. \nMOXICA You know what they will say in Spain about my death -- don't you? \nHe takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards him. \nMOXICA You are nothing!  You bastards will never inherit your titles.  We are everything.  We are immortal! \nHe smiles, and steps back into space. \nEXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY \nHis body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into the water. \nEXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY \nCOLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY \nCLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face. \nCUT TO: \nA MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held fast, a rope is put around his neck. \nCOLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives a signal. \nDrums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive. \nA grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking. \nThe drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his eyes. \nA wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole, their heads straight, the rope still tight around their necks. \nJustice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in silence, COLUMBUS stands up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY \nCLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together. They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares at the INDIANS. \nBROTHER BUYL I wish to go back with them, Don Colon.  I have no desire to remain in this godless place. \nCOLUMBUS You may do as you please, Brother Buyl -- though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly. \nBROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment. \nBROTHER BUYL You treat Christians equally with heathen savages.  You execute members of the nobility.  And what do you offer in return? \nCOLUMBUS (quietly) A new world, Brother Buyl. \nBROTHER BUYL Nobody wants one...!  Only you! \nAnd he walks away. \nEXT.  ISLAND - EVENING \nAgainst the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of the jungle. \nINT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING \nThe wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the building... a melancholy sound. \nCOLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself. \nCOLUMBUS Perhaps hope only exists in the journey.  When it begins, everything is still possible -- every expectation; every dream... \nThe BROTHERS do not answer. \nCOLUMBUS This is not how I imagined it to be. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT \nUTAPAN begins to shave his head... \nSANCHEZ (V.O.) I am thinking of a man.  A devotee to Your Majesties.  A man extremely motivated... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY \nFIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes, canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel. Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the hurricane are still visible... \nPeople look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the Palace. \nINT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY \nOne of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda. \nCOLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them. \nBOBADILLA Don Alonso de Bobadilla. \nCOLUMBUS Yes... I remember... \nBOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing the royal seal. \nBOBADILLA My letters of appointment. \nCOLUMBUS Appointment to what? \nBOBADILLA Viceroy of the West Indies. \nCOLUMBUS Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland. \nBOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low blow. \nBOBADILLA Didn't you learn?  The mainland was discovered.  Weeks ago.  By another Italian.  I forgot his name. \nA MAN IN BLACK Amerigo Vespucci, Excellency. \nCOLUMBUS pales.  Then... \nCOLUMBUS How far from here? \nBOBADILLA I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed. \nCOLUMBUS How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would. \nBOBADILLA I am afraid this is not the worst news. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY \nAll is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish. \nA key turns in the lock. \nThe JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN. COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light. \nFERNANDO (quietly) Father? \nUnable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up. \nCOLUMBUS Fernando...!  My God...! \nHe laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO. \nCOLUMBUS A man!  Diego, how did this happen? \nDIEGO Santangel is going to see the Queen. We are going to get you out of here. \nCOLUMBUS Good!  I have to go back! \nDIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus. \nDIEGO Go back? \nThere's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures... \nCOLUMBUS I have to explore the mainland. \nFERNANDO This time with me! \nSANCHEZ Then why? \nISABEL Because he is not afraid of me. \nINT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY \nSANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS. \nSANCHEZ All I have to do is call the guards. \nCOLUMBUS Call them. \nSANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets go of him. \nSANCHEZ I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer. \nCOLUMBUS Look out of that window. \nSurprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out. \nCOLUMBUS What do you see? \nSANCHEZ Roofs... towers, palaces... spires... \nCOLUMBUS All of them created by people like me. \nSANCHEZ turns round again to face him. \nCOLUMBUS No matter how long you live, Sanchez, there's something that will never change between us.  I did it! You didn't! \nCOLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the echoing corridor. \nEXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nCOLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life... \nINT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nCOLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing. \nHe turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back at him.  They are both moved. \nCOLUMBUS God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me... \nBEATRIX They tried... but I didn't let them. \nShe smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks round the empty room. \nBEATRIX They took everything... \nCOLUMBUS (looking at her) Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier... \nThey laugh.  There's a pause. \nCOLUMBUS God, how much I've missed you! \nAnd they throw themselves into each other's arms. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING \nAll that has been left is a simple table and one chair. They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as BEATRIX sits on his lap. \nSANTANGEL (O.S.) One chair.  One table.  What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown? \nThey laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to the kitchen. \nCOLUMBUS I owe you everything, Santangel... but as you see, I can't repay you. \nSANTANGEL On the contrary.  It is I who owe you everything.  Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world... but it's here... (he points to his head) And here... (pointing to his heart) \nCOLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass for SANTANGEL. \nSANTANGEL What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination... not a politician.  You weren't meant to govern -- You cannot be all things to all men. \nHe takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass. \nSANTANGEL I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life easier... \nCOLUMBUS (stunned) An ocean...?  He's says it's an ocean? \nFERNANDO I don't understand. \nCOLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The INDIANS laugh. \nThen COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son. \nCOLUMBUS Here is Europe... and over here, the continent of Asia.  But there's something in between!  Another continent!  We've found... another continent! \nFERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat. \nFERNANDO Father... \nCOLUMBUS There must be a passage to that other ocean. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT \nCOLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes his eyes. \nSuddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters. \nTRANSLATOR I help. \nA little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER. The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands. \nCOLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep. \nEXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT \nWe see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating, giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer and closer... \nCOLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent. COLUMBUS walks outside. \nEXT.  DECK - NIGHT \nCOLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY \nThe roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at anchor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RIVER - DAY \nTwo canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the jungle. \nEXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY \nSmoke rises lazily above the trees. \nCUT TO: \nThe boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village. THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village. \nFERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is still warm in bowls on the matted floor. \nA famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something disturbing about the appearance of the content. \nFERNANDO Oh my God... \nThe remains of human beings. \nCOLUMBUS (approaching) What is...? \nHe stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat, and vomits. \nSOLDIER Oh Virgen Maria... Oh Madre de Dios... (Oh Virgin Mary... Oh Mother of God...) \nBut as he vomits and cries, he notices: \nA HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass. Disturbed flies rise in clouds. \nSOLDIER Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos... (Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints...) \n", "test1_input": "Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming horse, his eyes full of hatred. \nEXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT \nA wide, high shot of the new \"City\", dominated by a huge wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles burning in the doorways.  A main square with the Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church. \nIn the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning, dirty and tired. \nEXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT \nMOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the \"veranda\", watching the MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute. \nMOXICA To the Governor of the Mosquitoes! \nThey laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire. Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language. \nMOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him. \nMOXICA Do you want her? \nHe turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside. \nGUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically: \nGUEVARA To the new world, my friend!  To the new world! \nINT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT \nIn an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO, served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with gusto. \nGIACOMO (as Nima pours the wine) Nima's a good cook! \nBARTOLOME She's more than that! \nSeeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh. \nTo cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic of the food. \nGIACOMO What is it? \nCOLUMBUS Eat!  I'll tell you later. \nAs he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses. \nGIACOMO I'd like to know what I'm eating. \nCOLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME. \nCOLUMBUS Iguana. \nA look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine. The BROTHERS laugh again. \nCOLUMBUS What wrong with it?  The Indians eat it! \nGIACOMO I'm not an Indian. \nBARTOLOME He wishes he were back in the seminary.  Priests always eat well. (tasting his wine, grimacing) And they have very good cellars. \nGIACOMO Nothing grows here!  Everything rots in the ground.  The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them. \nCOLUMBUS We've got to learn to live like the Indians. (pause) Eat your Iguana! \nReluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner. \nEXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT \nThey are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away. GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle beyond. \nCOLUMBUS How much gold have we found? \nBARTOLOME Not enough to justify a single shipment. \nCOLUMBUS Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination. \nBARTOLOME Then let's hope not... (pause) What will happen if we can't find enough gold? \nThey begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm. \nCOLUMBUS (jokingly) Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes. \n", "test1_true": "INT.  INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT \nAn INDIAN is playing the flute. \nIn the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.  On a segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several coughing. \nThey are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER BUYL, and other NOVICES. \nA NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head, helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do. \nBROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him. \nBROTHER BUYL What kind of disease is this? \nDOCTOR CHANCA I don't know.  It seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the Indians.  They die of our most common cold, and we of their plague. \nBROTHER BUYL God forgive us! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY \nA MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his agony.  He is held down, his voice muffled.  ISABEL turns away, shocked. \nShe is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR, SANCHEZ and other members of her court. \nThe patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered with virulent sores.  NUNS move between the beds. \nDOCTOR It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women, Your Majesty. \nISABEL Will he survive? \nDOCTOR No, Your Majesty.  They go mad -- then they die.  There is nothing we can do. \nISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled. \nSANCHEZ Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty. \nISABEL We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time. \nSANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.  But ISABEL, despite her words, looks distressed. \nEXT.  MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY \nExcavations carved into a hillside. \nIt is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill, GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in line at the table. \nIn turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each contribution. \nMOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly. \nTRANSLATOR He says he has not found any! \nMOXICA He's lying! \nAgain the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits him across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER. \nMOXICA Bring him here! \nThe frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.  One of the CLERKS slips away. \nMOXICA Tell him to put his hands on the table.  Like this! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY \nAt the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER. \nCLERK Don Giacomo, you'd better come at once! \nEXT.  MINE - DAY \nMOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS, still passively waiting. \nMOXICA Tell them I want them to watch this! \nThe terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS. \n", "test2_input": "CLERK Don't Moxica!  You can't... \nCUT TO: \nGIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene. \nCUT TO: \nMOXICA (to the clerk) I can't?  I can't? \nWith a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and cuts off the INDIAN'S hands. \nALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He stares at the dismembered hands in horror. \nINT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING \nA tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands before them. \nCOLUMBUS In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery! \nMOXICA (casually) Savagery is what monkeys understand. \nCOLUMBUS You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say? \nMOXICA (with exquisite insolence) You will regret this. \nHe strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room. \nEXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT \nEverything is quiet on the mine site. \nOn the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT \nA THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the wall. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT \nOn the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage his efforts. \nA whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is nailed to the wood behind him. \nTHE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry out for help. \nINT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT \nFOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted, burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be his friends. \nSOLDIER (without stopping) You animals!  Can't you wait! \nDiscovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her, the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his trousers. \nTHE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror. TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and suffocates. \nTHE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall, terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings, slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language. THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly. \nEXT.  MINE - DAY \nPAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air. \nPulling back, we discover: \nA DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been removed. \nUTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS. \nA SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is still alive -- not for long. \nCOLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage. \nBARTOLOME (aggressively) Moxica is right.  Our ways don't work! \nBARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN. \n", "test2_true": "UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people.  He looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion. \nCOLUMBUS You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did! \nUTAPAN You did the same to your God! \nCOLUMBUS is caught short. \nCOLUMBUS We have to stop this war. \nUTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines it. \nCOLUMBUS Do you know them? \nUTAPAN nods, uncomfortable. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY \nAround a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot. \nThis sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands up shouting. \nCOLUMBUS Stop!  Stop this! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT \nMOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them), silently approach the entrance of the mansion. \nA GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry. \nINT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT \nMOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall. On the table, the model of the future city. \nWatched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel. \nA mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes... \nEXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT \nThe half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS, his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS. \nGIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at him in disbelief. \nGIACOMO (through cracked lips) Moxica... \nEXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN \nCOLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle, looking for the MUTINEERS. \nThey reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing. COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a HALBERDIER. \nOthers follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads. \nA crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current. \nTwo more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river stained with blood. \nStill no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield... others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is shot down from the branches of a tree... \nThe first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to him is killed, and carried away by the current. \nNow, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves. There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are beginning to surrender. \nIn the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him. COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a cliff. \nEXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY \nMOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing in slow motion. \nEXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY \nMOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him. \nKnowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance. He steps backwards towards the edge. \n", "test3_input": "We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending a lecture of \"Nova Geographica\" -- the new geography. \nAROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him, enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS, including SANCHEZ. \nWe slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces. \nAROJAZ ... West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo.  From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael... Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios... \nWe continue to rise up the tiers of seats... \nAROJAZ Spain -- by Your Majesty's grace -- has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent... Tierra Incognita... \nOn a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, listening impassively. \nAROJAZ ... This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty... \nCLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes. \nAROJAZ His name... Amerigo Vespucci... \nOn COLUMBUS. \nEXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY \nAround the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS, a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him. \nCOLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the CROWD. \nCUT TO: \nAROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off. \nAROJAZ My God...!  I thought he was dead. \nThey pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not see them. \nSANCHEZ You can see for yourself. \nAROJAZ What a tragedy... what a waste of a life... \nSANCHEZ A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his. \nAROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN THE CROWD. \nEXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY \nANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers. \nThe presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved. \nMARCHENA I suppose we're both old men now. \nCOLUMBUS You'll always be older than me, Father. \nThey laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the sunlight. \nCOLUMBUS Have you ever forgiven me? \nMARCHENA nods his head. \nMARCHENA Yes.  I forgave you a long time ago. You see, I was proud of you.  You were like a willful child.  You wouldn't accept what others told you.  You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process. \nMARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly. \nMARCHENA Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens. \nCOLUMBUS nods. \nMARCHENA More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens... The world changes -- and yet it seems the same.  We find new worlds, but fill them with the same people... \nHe pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently. MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun. \nCOLUMBUS I have to disagree. \nMARCHENA I knew you would. \nCOLUMBUS New worlds create new people. \nMARCHENA Oh?  So you are a new man? \n", "test3_true": "MARCHENA starts laughing. \nMARCHENA God bless you, and those like you! \nThey both laugh. \nEXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING \nFERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass of pure white hair. \nBEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder. \nAs she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her back. \nCOLUMBUS Can't you stay with us a little? \nBEATRIX I am busy inside. \nHe smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued. \nBEATRIX What is it, now?  Tell me... \nCOLUMBUS I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you. \nFERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake air of reproach. \nCOLUMBUS What are you listening to? \nFERNANDO I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing. \nFERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly. \nFERNANDO It's Diego... He is at the Court, with Santangel... He says they hope to get your privileges restored... And maybe the house. \nCOLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very little importance to him now. \nCOLUMBUS But how is he?  And Dona Maria? \nFERNANDO continues to read. \nFERNANDO Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo... He says he received many letters for you.  Some of your men, mostly. \nHe opens one of them, glances at it. \nFERNANDO This one is from Mendez! \nCOLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy. \nCOLUMBUS What does he say? \nFERNANDO He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address. \nCOLUMBUS (smiling) He never had one... except aboard my ships! \nFERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious. \nFERNANDO I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything. \nCOLUMBUS Really? (pause) God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet... \nFERNANDO Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. \nCOLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur. \nCOLUMBUS I remember... \nWe see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER... \nA drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the words. \nFERNANDO is waiting. \nCUT TO: \nCOLUMBUS' eyes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY \n"}

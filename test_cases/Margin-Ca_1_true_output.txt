JOHN TULD They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs... Good luck. 
JOHN TULD looks at her. There is a security person standing at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks out. 
INT. PARKING GARAGE, BASEMENT OF OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 
WILL and SETH are sitting waiting for WILL'S car to be brought up. As they wait they see JARED COHEN come out of the elevator and walk towards them. 
SETH Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this way. 
WILL What does wonderboy want? 
WILL stands up and walks over to JARED. 
JARED COHEN Do you have a minute? 
WILL We're heading to get Eric Dale. 
JARED COHEN I know. I just need a second. 
THEY walk away from SETH. 
WILL What is it? 
JARED COHEN Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here. 
WILL looks around the garage, than back at JARED. 
WILL I don't think that's ever been a problem. 
JARED COHEN Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations. 
(CONTINUED) 52   CONTINUED:                                                       52 
They look at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the question. In the background the squeals of tires on concrete are heard. 
WILL Sam will step up. 
JARED COHEN I know he will...but if he doesn't... 
As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL. The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED hands the attendant a tip. JARED then looks back at WILL who is waiting to get in the car. 
JARED COHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But if he doesn't, we need to know that you will. 
WILL That I will what? 
JARED COHEN Step up. 
WILL climbs into the car and shuts the door. He looks at JARED through the open window with SETH now sitting next to him within earshot. 
WILL I have no doubt Sam will make the right choice. And if it makes you feel any better he and I have always had the same interpretation of what's right...no matter how acute the situation. 
WILL puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage leaving JARED standing there. 
INT. TRADING FLOOR - MORNING 
The floor is totally empty. Slow guitar music playing. The camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer screens. It turns the corner and then finally enters SAM'S office. 
INT. SAM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He is totally asleep. He has headphones on and looks like he could be dead he is so passed out. The music suddenly changes pace and the volume change startles him up. He looks around.

LENA (cont'd) Shut up. 
Monica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P. 
CAMILLE You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. 
LENA He's fine. 
CAMILLE (warning) Okay. 
Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son. 
LENA Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too cold. 
She exits inside.  Camille makes a face. 
CAMILLE God.  "Grandma." 
Monica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille stares at her daughter.  And then... 
CAMILLE (cont'd) You know, I'd probably be a lot more "prissy" in the situation than you'd like, but the thing I always admired that drove me crazy, was the fight you had in you. 
MONICA What are you talking about? 
CAMILLE When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. 
Monica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves. INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to 
sleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her 
choices, her future... 
Suddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and climbs out. 
EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS 
Monica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window. 
QUINCY (half-asleep) What's going on? 
MONICA We need to talk. 
Quincy just looks at her. 
MONICA (cont'd) Please. 
QUINCY Hold on. 
Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T- shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground. 
Quincy looks at her. 
MONICA You asked me what was missing. 
QUINCY What? 
MONICA From basketball. 
QUINCY you woke me up to tell me that? 
MONICA It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. 
Quincy stares at her. 
MONICA (cont'd) What I'm trying to say is -- 
QUINCY I heard enough. 
MONICA What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. 
QUINCY We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? 
MONICA I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. 
Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares. 
QUINCY You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't. 
MONICA Then why are you so upset? 
QUINCY Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. 
MONICA Better late than never, right? 
QUINCY Wrong. 
Quincy starts back toward the window. 
MONICA I'll play you. 
QUINCY What?

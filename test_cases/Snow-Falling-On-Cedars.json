{"test1_input": "HOOKS (O.S.) ...you were acquainted with the defendant and his family. \nETTA HEINE is a linebacker in a dress.  Stout and German and wary. She is 57, and pulls her hem down tight below her knees. \nETTA Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first. \nHOOKS So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then. \nETTA They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend. \nSaid not with pride, but regret. \nHOOKS But the dispute began.  With the father, yes? \nINT. HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY \nEtta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.  Carl is a huge rawboned man, and puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that. Etta knows trouble when she sees it. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nEtta pours her husband's coffee.  It is very quiet. \nETTA Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it. \nCARL SR. Only seven acres, and the worst seven, at that.  They're decent folks.  They got five hunnerd to put down now. \nETTA Don't go wavin' new church clothes at me.  We're not such paupers as sell to Japs, are we?  For what, a pouch of fancy pipe tobacco? \nShe walks about the kitchen with her arms folded.  Too upset to be still. \nCARL SR. They work hard, live clean, don't spend nothin'.  Even kind to the Indjuns.  People is people, comes down to it. \nEtta turns sharply.  Glares at the big man.  He just blinks blandly, puffs his pipe.  She can see this ship has sailed. \nETTA You wear the pants, doncha?  Go ahead, sell our land to a Jap and see what comes of it. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks pacing, slow and calm.  This part needs to be clear. \nHOOKS But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land.  So...? \nETTA Carl held it for 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December... \nHOOKS Why?  If they could never take title. \nETTA Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it. \nShe folds her hands.  Looks Kabuo square in the eye. \nETTA But they missed their last two payments.  So that was that. \nINT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY \nCarl Sr. and Zenhichi sit at the table.  There is coffee.  But it is untouched.  Etta watches by the stove. \nETTA (V.O.) March 1942, orders came down.  Japs had eight days before the Army was gonna cart 'em off. \nCarl lights his pipe.  Compassion in his broad weathered face. \nCARL SR. (softly) Eight days.  It ain't right. \nZENHICHI We must leave everything.  If you like, you can work our fields, sell berries, keep the money.  Otherwise, they just rot. \nETTA (V.O.) Japs are shrewd.  Offer berries he can't use.  Soften us up about those two payments still to come. \nAnd sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills.  Puts them on the table. \nZENHICHI Today, I have $120 toward next paym... \nCARL SR. Absolutely not, Zenhichi.  I'm not gonna take your savings at a time like this. \nThe small man spreads the bills out.  On the table. \nZENHICHI Please, you take.  Then, I send more from where I'm going.  If not enough, you still have seven acres strawber... \nETTA Thought you was givin' us those. \nAnd everything.  Stops. \nETTA Didn't you come in here givin' them away?  Now you want $130, after our labor and fertilizer.  Is that what you come here hopin' on? \nZenhichi keeps his anger within.  His face is stone. \nETTA (V.O.) I spit on him, and he's pretending it didn't happen that way.  How could anyone trust people like that? \nETTA You want more coffee? \nZENHICHI No, thank you.  Take money, please. \nBut Carl is staring at his wife.  She stares right back.  Carl turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi. \nCARL SR. Etta's been rude to you, and I apologize for that.  You keep this money, and those payments will work out fine.  Somewhere down the road. \nINT. PARLOR - TWILIGHT \nSilence.  Palpable.  Two figures sit at opposite ends of this darkening room, each under a lamp.  Carl Sr. is reading the paper. His face is stone.  Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills and ledgers.  Her face is angry. \nA screen door opens.  Slams shut.  Big footfalls coming.  No one looks up. \nCARL JR. Look at this! \nHe stands in the doorway.  A bamboo fishing road in his giant hand. \nCARL JR. Kabuo loaned it to me.  Til he gets back. \nAnd his parents stare back him. \nCARL JR. It's great for sea-run cutthroat. The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped. \nETTA Take that back.  And do it now. \nThe big young face is stunned, hurt. \n", "test1_true": "ETTA Those Japs owe us.  I don't want nothin' confusing that. \nThe boy looks to his father.  Who says nothing. \nETTA I said now, boy.  Supper's in forty minutes. \nCrestfallen, defeated, the boy backs away.  Hear his footfalls. The screen door SLAM hard. \nAnd Carl Sr. looks at his wife.  No sound, until... \nCARL SR. We ain't right together. \nThe words are flat and straight.  Etta stoic. \nCARL SR. You and me.  We just ain't right. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks settles back.  His butt on the edge of the prosecutor's table.  The soul of patience and clarity. \nHOOKS You said neither of the last two payments were made.  But your husband told defendant's father that he could pay them...what, 'down the road'. \nAnd straight back... \nETTA Road ended October 1944, when my husband passed away. \nShe nods.  That's all there was to it. \nETTA I sold all the land to our neighbor, Ole Jurgensen.  Got a fair price, this time.  And... \nStraightens her spine.  To deliver the clincher... \nETTA Sent all their equity back to those Japs down in California.  Which I didn't have to do.  Specially since my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin' shot at by Japs at the time. \nHooks pauses.  As if drinking this in. \nHOOKS Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity. \nETTA In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they? \nKabuo watching the woman.  Eyes as hard as her own. \nHOOKS And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps. \nETTA Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son. \nINT. ETTA'S APARTMENT, AMITY HARBOR - DAY \nKabuo stands at the open door.  No one is inviting him inside. \nETTA He's over the ocean, fighting the Japs.  They're just about licked. \nKABUO (quietly) Just about. \nAnd there it sits. \nETTA When Mr. Heine passed away, I couldn't farm the place myself, could I?  You're gonna have to talk to Ole abou... \nKABUO I just did.  He didn't know we were one payment away.  You didn't tell him Mr. Heine promised my fath... \nETTA I was s'posed to tell him there's some illegal contract muddling things up?  You folks didn't make your pay- ments.  In America, bank comes in and repossesses your land.  I didn't do anything wrong. \nKabuo stands.  Calm, unblinking. \nKABUO Nothing illegal.  Wrong is a different mat... \nETTA Get out of here. \nKABUO You sold our land out from under us, Mrs. Heine.  You took advantage of the fact that we were gone.  You... \nSLAMM.  The door has closed in his face.  And Kabuo stands there. As if deciding. \nWhether to break it down. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks standing at the jury box now.  Looking at them, as he asks... \nHOOKS What do you mean by 'dirty looks'? \nETTA Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face. \nHOOKS When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this? \nETTA That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him. \nHOOKS Did he see some danger from defen... \nNELS Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind. \nHOOKS All right.  What did your son say to that effect? \nShe looks up.  As if trying to recall. \nETTA He said he wished Kabuo would forget about his seven acres, and stop lookin' at us cross-eyed. \nHooks stares at the jury.  Holds the moment. \nHOOKS Your witness. \nAnd goes slowly back to his seat.  Nels waits until his opponent is seated.  Then, rises. \nNELS Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for \nETTA Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments. \nNELS Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre? \nETTA A thousand. \nNELS So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500. \n", "test1_id": 1560, "test2_input": "HOOKS Except even when Sheriff Moran arrested you.  You said nothing about seeing Carl. \nTurns to the jury.  Openly bewildered. \nHOOKS At that point, you were already under suspicion.  The battery story explained things.  If the story was true...and not simply something you thought up later... \nTurns back.  To the defendant. \nHOOKS Why.  Didn't you.  Tell it? \nNo reaction from the defendant.  Nothing anyone can see. \nKABUO Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer... \nHOOKS But even after you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know nothing.  Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct? \nA beat. \nKABUO Yes.  Initially. \nHOOKS Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance! \nSilence. \nKABUO I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it. \nHOOKS Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth. \nWe can just discern the anger.  At the edge of Kabuo's steady gaze. Silence. \nHOOKS Nothing to say? \nKABUO (quietly) I didn't know that was a question. It sounded like a speech. \nAnd Hooks smiles.  Loving it.  Walks toward the witness, stalking him. \nHOOKS My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth? \nKABUO I have told the truth. \nHOOKS You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir. \nKABUO (even quieter) Yes.  And I told it long before this morning. \nHOOKS I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest. \nKABUO I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat. \nHOOKS Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth. \nKABUO Yes. \nHooks leans over the box.  Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space. \nHOOKS Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible? \nKABUO I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up. \nAh.  I see. \nHOOKS Conveniently, in your shed.  Only you didn't mention that a moment ago. Why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised? \nKabuo looks at him, evenly. \nKABUO You asked if I went straight to the boat.  I did.  With the battery. \nHooks steps back.  Looks the witness over. \nHOOKS You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f... \nNELS (O.S.) Objection! \nJUDGE You know better than that, Mr. Hooks.  Either ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with it. \nSilence.  The judge staring hard.  Hooks never flinching. \nJUDGE Shame on you. \nHooks turns his eyes to Kabuo.  Stares him down, so the jury can watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return.  And softly... \nHOOKS I apologize to the court, for letting my feelings get the better of me. \nTurns away. \nHOOKS No other questions.  We'll go to summation. \nAs he returns to his table.  As Kabuo steps down from the box. We PAN... \n...reporters' row.  The boys are writing as fast as their hands can move.  Only Ishmael is not writing at all.  He stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee.  We CLOSE to see... \nOne word circled.  The word 'lantern'. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nAlvin Hooks stalks the jury box now.  Prowls before them along the rail.  As their eyes follow. \nHOOKS ...believing that Etta Heine's son would never sell him the land.  Land that in his mind, filtered through ancient rules of behavior handed down from his ancestors' culture, belonged to his family by right... \nStops.  To make sure they understand. \nHOOKS His only choice to get the land would be to eliminate Carl Heine. So that Ole Jurgensen would need a new buyer. \nPacing again, hand trailing along the rail... \nHOOKS In his mind.  Seen through codes of revenge difficult for us to fathom, this was also the only way to avenge what he felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father, his family... \nRaises his finger.  This must be heard... \nHOOKS ...to a thousand years of ancestry, in a foreign land we still find an enigma.  Despite our recent bitter experience with its ways. \nAnd stops once more.  Places his hands on the rail. \nHOOKS Thus believing cold-blooded murder to be justified...he trailed Carl Heine... could hear his engine in the fog...and sounded his own horn, claiming distress. \n", "test2_true": "HOOKS As Carl pulled alongside: 'Please, Carl,' the defendant must have said. 'I am sorry for what has come between us, but adrift here in the fog, I plead for your help!' \nImagine.  Imagine that. \nHOOKS And so this good man tied his boat fast, while his enemy leaps aboard, striking the treacherous blow he was trained to strike by his father's hand. \nCounting off the facts.  One finger at a time. \nHOOKS The feud over these seven acres had festered for eight years.  He argued with Carl about buying the land one week before Carl was killed. Carl's skull was crushed, and his blood is on a murder weapon with which the defendant is a deadly expert! \nSpreads his arms.  Wide. \nHOOKS And after a series of lies.  The defendant at last admits he was there.  Alone on the boat.  In the fog.  Carl Heine's blood on his fishing gaff. \nA hush.  A murmur... \nHOOKS My lord.  My lord. \nLooking into the eyes now.  Of each man.  Each woman. \nHOOKS Look clearly at the defendant. See the truth self-evident in him. And in the facts of this case. \nAnd turns.  So that they will follow his eyes to Kabuo's stone- hard gaze. \nHOOKS Look into his eyes, ladies and gentlemen, consider his face. And ask yourself what your duty is as citizens of this community. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nPAN the jury, slowly, as they hear... \nNELS (O.S.) ...not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre- meditated murder.  Not in the days before Carl Heine's death...or at any time...has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased. \nNels stands very still.  Hands resting on the rail.  As calm and quiet as his adversary had been dramatic. \nNELS Etta Heine had cheated his family. He had asked his childhood friend Carl to sell him the land.  And Carl was considering it. \nLeans forward.  Just a little. \nNELS There is no evidence of anger at Carl, much less rage, much less murderous rage.  No reason for premeditation and no evidence of it.  Anywhere. \nHe picks out a housewife.  The youngest.  Smiles sadly, wisely.  As her grandfather might. \nNELS And yet the state is required to prove these things.  Beyond.  A reasonable.  Doubt. \nHis eyes widen. \nNELS Can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt?  Why is Kabuo's D-6 battery in Carl's well, if Carl was helping him? \nWhy? \nNELS Why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with Carl's hand wound than a skull fracture?  Given the absence of bone or brain tissue. \nAnd now.  he begins to pace, limping slightly, eyes down. \nNELS What Mr. Hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed.  Against a man who bombed Pearl Harbor. \nSlow.  Eyes on his feet. \nNELS Look at his face, the prosecutor said. Presuming that you will see an enemy there.  Treacherous by nature, by a thousand years of something or other. \nHe stops.  Looks at them. \nNELS An argument I find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all.  Mr. Miyamoto is a much-decorated hero of the United States Army.  For God's sake. \nThe feeling wells in te old man.  It bleeds through the very quietness of his voice. \nNELS If someone said you should convict Carl Heine.  Or his lovely widow. Of murder.  Without proof.  Because their ancestry is the same as Hitler's.  You would spit in his eye. \nYes, you would. \nNELS And every decent American.  Would applaud you. \nHe leans his elbows on their rail.  As if confiding to them across their backyard fence. \nNELS Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing wrong.  He was afraid to trust us, at first.  Afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice.  As Mr. Hooks is urging you to do. \nSilence. \nNELS Well, we sent him.  And his wife. And thousands of Americans to concentration camps.  They lost homes, belongings, everything. We did that, folks.  Can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty? His mistrust? \nLooking in their eyes.  As if waiting for an answer.  They shift their weight, fidget beneath his gaze. \nNELS You may think this is a small trial. In a small place.  Well, it isn't. \nHe straightens his spine.  Winces slightly, with the pain of it. \nNELS Every once in awhile.  Somewhere in the world.  Humanity goes on trial.  And integrity.  And decency. Every once in awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race. \nThe eyes are watering.  But the voice gains strength. \nNELS Now here in America.  We relish those chances.  Give us that one, we say.  That's why we built this country in the first place. \nOne step back.  Just above a whisper... \nNELS Be Americans.  Make your children proud. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nCLOSE on handcuffs SNAPPING into place.  Sheriff Moran checks their snugness about Kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the courtroom in the wake of adjournment.  Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the witness box.  But... \n...someone is there.  In the doorway.  And Moran's grip tightens as they approach... \nMORAN I'm awful sorry, Ma'am, but you know I c... \nHATSUE What are you afraid of, Sheriff? \nThe edge on that, the ballsy undertone, throws him a little. \nHATSUE Am I going to slip him a weapon for a mad escape?  Perhaps a kendo staff hidden in my dress? \nMORAN There's rules. \n", "test2_id": 1561, "test3_input": "There it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other cigarette to his lips.

You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone.  I liked that one, they didn't.  No surprise. \nNels leans to the flame.  Sucks it in.  Savors a drag. \nNELS Last.  You gave your arm.

But Nels doesn't seem to notice. \nNELS Some let go, some don't.  Where did you? \nAsked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now, surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm. \nISHMAEL (a murmur) Hooks called her deceitful. And I knew she wasn't. \nHe's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently. \nISHMAEL She was an honest person.  Doing the best she could. \nWe follow her approach toward the courtroom door.  She has not yet turned to us. \nNELS (O.S.) The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off.  She was desperate.  Her husband helpless...I was helpless... \nNels rises.  With great effort. \nNELS You couldn't let her.  Be helpless. \nIshmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her mother's murmurings, as she... \n...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way. \nNELS When this verdict is read.  She may look for your face. \nAnd Ishmael's eyes come up.  Because the voice commands it. \nNELS Here's what she needs to see:  This is nothing.  We win it on appeal. \nThe old man is stern and strong.  He wants a promise. \nISHMAEL It'll be there. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one coughs, no one blinks... \nJUDGE (clears his throat) Mister foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? \nHe looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury box. \nHAROLD JENSEN We have, Your Honor. \nAnd holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded once. \nJUDGE Will the bailiff please bring the verdict to the bench. \nThe bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and... \n...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and as he hands it back to the bailiff... \nJUDGE (softly) Will the defendant please rise. \nKabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either man.  But something passes, all the same. \nAs the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we SNAP TO... \nREVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman, now opening the slip of paper. \nEvery pair.  But one. \nJUDGE (O.S.) Will the foreman please read the verdict aloud. \nOne reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines. Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes. To be waiting. \nHAROLD JENSEN (reads) We the jury, find the defendant, Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not guilty of the cri... \nA sharp SCREAM, and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth in embarrassment. \nHAROLD JENSEN (continues) ...of the crime with which he has been char... \nAPPLAUSE breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum, as has... \n...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now... \n...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.

Saying only to the jury... \nJUDGE This is your verdict, so say you all? \nAs they assent... \nJUDGE This Court thanks you for the good work you have done under difficult circumstances... \nReaches STRONG to the gavel, turns to the defendant... \nJUDGE Go home, son.

COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - LATER \nThe Miyamotos holding court, surrounded by nearly twenty reporters and photographers, and countless looky-loo's of all persuasions. Hatsue's face is flushed and intense, unsmiling, she seems scarcely to have caught her breath.  She holds tight to her husband's hand, as he... \n...carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench beside her mom.  Kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of humility and friendliness.  An American family.  Photogenic as hell. \nREPORTER #1 And how about the jury?  You had confidence they'd see justice done? \nKabuo glances to his lawyer, wanna field this one?  But Nels sends it back with a twinkle. \nKABUO Oh, sure.  These are our neighbors, you know.  They've got good hearts.  We could see they were following the evidence real close... \nAt his side, Hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces... \nKABUO We're just grateful to every one of them. \n...looking for something she doesn't find. \nREPORTER #2 And you ma'am?  You felt the same as your husband, I expect? \nHer eyes move to the eager young man.  She reflects for a beat. \nHATSUE Honestly, no. \nWhich catches everyone.  A little short. \nHATSUE (quietly) I felt my husband would be found guilty.  Unless proven innocent. \nNo apologies for the truth.  That's not her way. \nHATSUE And Mr. Chambers did that. \nINT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT \nA vending machine stands in silence.  The eerie strobing glow of defective neon.  PULL BACK as... \nIshmael thinks it over.  Drops in his dime.

The crowd of onlookers has grown. \nREPORTER #3 ...can we get some background on your handsome family?  I understand you two were childhood sweethearts... \nAnd brings his Parker pen to his notepad.  His subject smiles easily... \nKABUO Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I guess that was the most beautiful place I've ever been. \nThere is gentle laughter.  And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something in the rear of the crowd.  Something we do not.  And softly... \nKABUO No, her first love was another fella... \nWhich brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze.  And there, in the back.  A man watches.  Eating a candy bar. \nKABUO (O.S.) I was the lucky one. \nNo one sees their eyes lock.  It is only an instant. \nIt is enough. \nREPORTER #4 It all sounds very romantic, ma'am.  Falling in love under those circumstances... \nAnd as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away... \nHATSUE He went off to the Army, right from Manzanar.  And that last night, we danced alone in the desert... \nAnd somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old daughter.  So he pulls a coin from his pocket... \nHATSUE (O.S.) I told him.  If you don't come back alive, I'll kill you. \n...Ishmael ROLLS the coin across his knuckles.  And the child responds... \nWith her mother's smile. \nEXT.

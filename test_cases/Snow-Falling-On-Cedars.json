{"train": "\"Snow Falling on Cedars\", early, by Ronald Bass \nSNOW FALLING ON CEDARS \nRonald Bass First Draft Screenplay March 3, 1997 \nEXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT \nFog.  Penetrated only by sound.  The LAPPING of sea at a drifting hull.  Tendrils of mist part, revealing... \n...a face.  Strong and blond and handsome. \nSUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954 \nLONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross spar of his mast.  He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN TITLES BEGIN... \nANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.  Empty, silent.  A tin COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to... \n...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where... \n...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part, we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see... \n...his eyes.  They are Asian.  SMASH CUT to... \nEXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - MORNING \nBlinding sun.  Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to... \n...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed. CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the floor.  PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.  CUT to... \n...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface... \n...the face of Carl Heine.  Turned to the sun.  SMASH CUT to... \nINT. CORONER'S LAB - DAY \nWHITE fills the frame.  A hand PULLS back the blanket-shroud revealing Carl's face.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, tilt up to the coroner, HORACE WHALEY, gazing down.  A shading of regret behind the professional mask.  A series of QUICK CUTS... \n...Whaley's hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carl's pocket... \n...examines the open, empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carl's belt... \n...Carl's wrist, its WATCH stopped at 1:47... \nWhaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus, watching pink FOAM rise from Carl's mouth and nose.  And then. He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair from above Carl's left ear, to reveal... \n...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across. \nEXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY \nSnow falling on cedars. \nSUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6. \nThe heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent, hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of QUICK ANGLES... \n...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows... \n...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene... \n...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water, and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes... \n...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and flawless as the Sahara... \nFinally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can, people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to... \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nCLOSE on impassive EYES.  They are Asian.  We have seen them before.  PULL BACK to see... \nKABUO MIYAMOTO.  Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt.  He sits ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a storm of movement in... \n...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals, the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS, cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) It was the first murder trial on the island in thirty-one years. \n...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's, dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on his right leg. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Our only newspaper was the San Piedro Review, a four-page weekly that I operated alone. \nHe glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) What, I wondered, could the Seattle boys know of the hearts of these people... \nTo the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober neckties.  A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Neighbors, sitting in judgement. On their neighbor. \nTo the neighbor.  The ramrod-still defendant. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if detached from his own trial. \nIshmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee, until... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be?  With this jury. \n...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see... \n...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom. A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more, unheeded. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Hatsue Miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days. \nIshmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad. For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) He was in jail.  When his baby son learned to walk. \nThrough his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes meet.  A string of FLASHES... \nBut none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his face... \nINT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY \nMATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door. Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as removed from this place as is her husband's. \nHOOKS So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two. \nMORAN These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip. \nEXT. DOCKS - DAY \nIshmael walking down the sunlit wharf.  Purpose in his stride... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) A gill-netter works through black nights with only himself to talk to.  And learns to be silent. They were lonely men and products of geography. \nUp ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.  Moran stands chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) ...men who, on occasion, realized that they wished to speak, but couldn't. \nAs he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.  Not happy to see him. Of course, neither is anyone else. \nMORAN Figure you'da heard by now. \nIshmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.  WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp cigar butt. \nGJOVAAG You go fishing, it happens. \nISHMAEL (to Moran) You see Susan Marie? \nMORAN I did.  Boy. \nISHMAEL Three kids.  What's she going to do? \nGJOVAAG (disgusted) Well, what can she do?  Jesus Christ. \nISHMAEL Excuse me, Gjovaag. \nGJOVAAG I don't need to excuse nothin'. Fuck you anyhow, Chambers. \nEverybody laughs.  It is all good-natured, sort of. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Like the Sheriff, I did not work the sea, and could never merit trust. Or respect. \nMARTY JOHANSSON Sheriff's been askin' which boats followed Carl out last night... \nMORAN (quickly) Only to see if somebody talked to him out th... \nISHMAEL So who talked to him?  Out there. \nStaring.  At each other.  Eye contact holds during... \nJAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish) So far, we figured the guys who went to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry, Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto... \nGJOVAAG (spits) Japs. \nMORAN All right, look, if you see these boys... \nGJOVAAG Never saw you so hard-ass, Art. Ain't this just an accident? \nMoran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's.  Which are right there, waiting.  Moran looks away. \nMORAN Course it is, but a man's dead, William.  I got to write my report. \nANGLE...Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf.  The Sheriff is worried.  Finally... \nMORAN I'm not gonna see some article about an investigation, am I? \nISHMAEL (quietly) You want me to lie? \nMORAN No, I wanna be off the damn record, that's what I want. \nNo answer.  They keep walking. \nMORAN I mean, if there is a killer, why would you want him all alerted? \nSilence.  Silence.  And slowly... \nISHMAEL Let's say...someday I need some cooperation from you on this thing. Do I get it? \nAnd looks over.  Like the guy holding all the aces. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nMoran fidgets on the stand. \nNELS (O.S.) No sign of a struggle, you say. \nSEE him now.  NELS GUDMUNDSSON, attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto, stands beside his impassive client.  Nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a little shaky.  His body is winding down. \nMORAN Well, the coffee cup was layin' right in the middle of the floor, like I said.  And with a fella so neat as Carl, that did seem peculiar. \nAnd Nels begins to walk toward him.  Limping, as he comes. \nNELS As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake? \nHOOKS (O.S.) Objection, asking the witness to speculate. \nNELS My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that? \nA real.  Friendly smile. \nJUDGE (wearily) That's quite enough horseplay, Nels, why don't you act your age? \nNELS If I did that Your Honor, I'd be dead. \nSome gentle laughter.  Judge Fielding doesn't even bother to look annoyed. \nJUDGE Any more homely loveable tricks, and you'll be worse than that. Proceed, gentlemen. \nHOOKS There's an objection, Your H... \nJUDGE And it's overruled, answer the question.  If you can recall it. \nMORAN Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup. \nNELS Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor. \nMORAN Maybe. \nZENHICHI Elbow soft, or there is no follow- through.  You cut your bokken off from the power of your body, unl... \nWHAP!  WHAP!  WHAP!  The boy LASHES fiercely, the man parrying each stroke with blinding ease. \nZENHICHI Hips sink more.  Less weight on the heels, so tha... \nCRASH!  The father has sent a blow in mid-word, FLINGING the child like a doll.  The boy BOUNCES up, snatching his bokken into ready position. \nZENHICHI (very quiet) Zenshin.  Is constant awareness. Of dang... \nWHAP!  The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his father's HEAD.  It has been blocked.  The staffs rest against each other, just above Zenhichi's ear.  There is no anger in either warrior.  That we can see. \nZENHICHI Elbow soft.  A little better. \nLATER...father and son sit on the ground, eating a small meal. The sun has risen, angling light across the undulating fields. They are alone in beauty.  A long silence.  Dialogue in subtitled JAPANESE... \nZENHICHI You can be good with the bokken. If you begin to concentrate. \nEyes on his food.  As if alone, as if speaking to himself.  The boy darting glances, unseen, at his father's profile. \nZENHICHI You must choose now, Kabuo.  At eight years.  If you want this. \nKABUO (boldly) I want it. \nThe father keeps eating.  Never turns. \nZENHICHI Then speak quietly.  So you may be heard. \nINT. COURTROOM - MORNING \nWhaley stares down the end of his needle-nose.  The air of disdain of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent. \nNELS (O.S.) So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there? \nWHALEY As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that. \nNELS (slightly confused) But a drowned person can't breathe. \nWHALEY Of course not.  The foam means that he went in breathing. \nAh. \nWHALEY That's why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death. \nNELS Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard. \nWHALEY Well... \nNELS Your report says death by drowning, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...? \nWHALEY (bristles) Of course it's accurate, but... \nNELS Of course, it is.  Now as to the head injury.  You say made by an object narrow and flat.  That is your inference, correct? \nWHALEY (really pissed) It's my job to infer, that's what coroners do.  You get hit with a crowbar, or a ball-peen hammer, or fall off a motorcycle, the injuries look different, that's my area of expertise. \nNels nods.  He can be quiet now.  The witness distracted from volunteering the opinions Nels did not wish for. \nNELS In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes? \nWHALEY Obviously. \nNELS Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same. \nWHALEY The same. \nNELS So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have... \nWHALEY If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be. \nNELS Is it possible? \nWHALEY Sure, anything's poss... \nNELS Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was. \nWHALEY I already said that, b... \nNELS And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death? \nWhaley thinks. \nWHALEY For certain, no. \nNELS But you are certain that he died by drowning. \nWHALEY For the third time, yes. \nNels nods.  Whaley is beyond frustrated. \nWHALEY Can I say something, here? \nNELS Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death? \nWHALEY Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most. \nA pause. \nNELS Are you absol... \nWHALEY Yes, I'm sure. \nNels nods.  Silence. \nNELS Thank you, Horace.  No more questions. \nHorace wants to say more.  Doesn't immediately move. \nJUDGE We'll take our luncheon recess. Reconvene at...2 o'clock sharp. \nThe gavel CRACKS onto the block.  Judge Fielding stands to leave, and the BAILIFF begins to usher the jury from its box.  Abel Martinson, the deputy, stands near as Kabuo rises.  As he puts his hand gently on Kabuo's arm, the defendant turns smoothly... \n...to face a woman.  Standing at the rail.  And beneath the courtroom buzz... \nMRS. SHIGEMURA No.  You must never look at a man directly.  This is part of grace. \nThe girl smiles a small sour smile.  Speaks quietly... \nHATSUE I don't think the boys on this island.  Are impressed.  By grace. \nThe old woman studies her without irritation. \nMRS. SHIGEMURA Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue. \nApparently, the girl has heard this before. \nMRS. SHIGEMURA This is why they fear death.  Because life here is separate from Being. \nThe girl takes a long pin.  Begins carefully to fasten her hair. Breaking eye contact with the mirror. \nMRS. SHIGEMURA It is why they have no soul. \nIs the girl even listening?  The old woman's voice never rises. Remains patient. \nMRS. SHIGEMURA Life embraces death, includes it. This truth brings tranquility.  You must see yourself... \nHATSUE ...as a leaf.  On a great tree. \nNo irony in the girl's voice.  No disrespect.  The old woman reads the young face in the mirror. \nMRS. SHIGEMURA The pin.  Could be better placed. \nINT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY \nCLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael.  Neutral eyes.  Eating an apple.  A horrific CLANGING surrounds us.  The clash of metal on metal. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) My lessons came from my father.  They were different.  Or seemed so, at the time. \nSee ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast- iron housing.  The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient locomotive. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) He operated the Review alone, with an integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect.  If slightly larger than life. \nArthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves.  He wears the soft, perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) He never spoke of wanting me to succeed him.  And, in truth, it was the last job on earth I thought I'd ever want. \nThe boy rises now.  Sets his apple carefully aside.  And under his father's supervision, takes his place operating the press.  His arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) When I was five, he casually mentioned that if his sleeve got caught in the press, he'd be instantly popped open like a child's balloon, and splattered across the walls. \nWatch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with complete concentration. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Even his bones would disappear, to be discovered later on the floor, as strips of white confetti. \nArthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence.  Picks up the boy's apple.  A crisp BITE. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Which, of course, made me certain that life would have no meaning until I could run that teakettle. \nEXT. MAIN STREET, AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET \nArthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of what seems a festive carnival. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) He was, for better or worse, the only God in my life.  I guess it's our nature to resent those we know we can never measure up to... \nThey are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games. A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races heedlessly mingling.  A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips his arm over the shoulder of his tall son. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) ...which keeps us from accepting the warmth.  The way we should. \nUp ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse. Something's up. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Every summer, after harvest, the Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor- ite story to cover.  Good news was his preference.  Making him an oddity among journalists. \nAs we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the courthouse steps. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Highlight was crowning the Strawberry Princess.  Always a Japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony. \nWe are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael would use years later.  Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the crown on the radiant young girl... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Senior Year.  It was Hatsue. \nAnd as the applause ripples through the crowd.  As the Strawberry Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on... \n...Ishmael.  She drops him a wink.  And a special wave. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) She winked at me.  In public. Which was unusual. \nEXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY \nTwo 14-year-olds alone on a beach.  Digging for clams in the mud. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I had kissed her once, when we were ten.  Looking at fish through a glass-bottomed box.  It was just an impulse, and no big deal. \nIshmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to reach down.  We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in geoduck clam. \nHATSUE He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret. \nThey are digging now, together.  Carefully. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily. \nHATSUE Easy.  Slow is best. \nGently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I thought about her.  Sometimes, all the time.  I knew I was unhappy. But I knew if I told her... \nShe lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her movements. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) It might be a mistake.  I could never correct. \nISHMAEL (quietly) I like you. \nThe words make her turn.  Not startled, exactly.  Alerted.  But neutral, without affect. \nISHMAEL Do you know what I mean, Hatsue? I've always liked you. \nETTA Is that your third question? \nNELS It is. \nETTA You done your math right. \nThe old man wears a thin, cold smile. \nNELS You, too.  No further questions. \nHOLD on Kabuo.  As he watches Etta rise heavily from the box. \nEXT. DEEP FOREST - FIRST LIGHT \nMist of moments before dawn.  As tendrils part, there is enough light to see... \n...eyes.  They are Asian.  They are razor-keen.  PULL BACK to reveal... \n...Kabuo alone in G.I. gear and helmet.  Rifle up high, sweat on his face, moving soundlessly, turning in a circle as he goes, until... \n...he stops.  A heartbeat of silence.  Then... \n...the BLAST of automatic tracer TEARS through trees, as he WHIRLS and RETURNS FIRE in a single motion, until... \nSilence. \nHis heart is pounding.  He waits.  Waits.  Weapon at the ready, he pushes THROUGH the dense foliage to see... \n...the 15-year-old German SOLDIER, splayed on the forest floor, his chest torn and bloodied.  Kabuo's gaze LOCKS with the boy's.  The young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly... \n...INTO view, metal GLINTING in motion, as Kabuo... \n...BLOWS the boy AWAY with staccato rifle BURSTS that JUMP the already-lifeless body like an electric jolt.  And falling from the kid's hand, not a pistol, but... \n...ID TAGS. \nNo expression on Kabuo's face.  None at all.  He moves on. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nOLE JURGENSEN wobbles slightly in the witness box, hands resting on the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs.  His eyes leak water, his beard is wispy and unkempt. \nHOOKS Were those his exact words? \nOLE (shaky) He say Mrs. Heine robbed him. Mr. Heine never woulda let no such ting like that hap... \nHOOKS Robbed.  He was angry. \nOLE Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back. \nHooks nodding.  Nodding. \nHOOKS Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you? \nOLE Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell. \nHOOKS And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy? \nOLE Carl Heine came. \nHooks pauses.  Lets that sink in. \nHOOKS But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it. \nOLE He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place. \nThe old man's head bobs.  Recalling. \nOLE Liesel and me.  Was happy for him. \nHooks smiles.  As if he would be happy, too.  Anyone would be. \nHOOKS And later, that same day.  Only eight days before Carl Heine died. Did another prospective buyer appear? \nEXT. FARMHOUSE PORCH - DAY \nOle sits in a wicker chair at a wicker table.  His wife LIESEL is setting out cold drinks.  But their visitor stands rigid, disbelieving. \nLIESEL I'm sorry to tell you, we took his earnest money, he shook Ole's hand. Come November, he'll sell his boat, and take over the farm. \nKabuo is thunderstruck. \nKABUO But your sign... \nOLE We din't have no time to take it down. He just come ten o'clock. \nKabuo nods.  His voice is soft, but his eyes are steel. \nKABUO It's my fault.  I should have come earlier. \nHe looks so odd, perhaps he's ill.  Liesel looks concerned. \nOLE If you want t'buy them seven acres.  Carl Heine's the only fella can sell 'em. \nINT. COURTROOM - EVENING \nThe witness box is empty.  The snow outside the windows is falling in darkness.  And Judge Lew Fielding is leaning his frame toward the jurors... \nJUDGE I apologize for keeping you folks from your families in a storm like this.  I do hope you'll be reasonably comfortable in the hotel tonight.  And one more thing... \nHe smiles softly. \nJUDGE This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that tomorrow is the 13th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. \nSlight pause.  To make sure they are listening. \nJUDGE Which has no relationship to this trial.  Which is why I mention it. \nGavel CRACKS down. \nJUDGE 10 o'clock tomorrow, folks.  Stay warm. \nINT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER \nReaches stiffly.  Kabuo bends toward him.  Accepts the flame. Takes a puff. \nNELS Prosecutor thinks.  What was your reason?  To kill Carl Heine. \nKabuo says not a word. \nNELS Well, there is the land itself. Raise your children where you were raised.  Sleep with your wife at night, 'stead of bein' alone on the sea. \nBrings the match to his own cigar.  Careful.  Expert. \nNELS There's fairness and honor.  You were cheated by that old bitch. Boy, she is something. \nKABUO (simply) She's not alone. \nWorlds within those words. \nNELS (a murmur) None of us are. \nAnd in those. \nNELS And prejudice, like you say.  Your people locked in a concentration camp.  You go off to fight for our country's freedom.  Come back to this. \nShakes his head. \nNELS But Mr. Hooks has missed the one reason.  One reason.  You coulda done it. \nA flicker.  Behind the defendant's eyes. \nNELS I read you Etta Heine's deposition. So I could watch your mind.  Like I do when you move your rook, or when I move mine. \nA smile now.  Very kind.  Very sad. \nNELS And you weren't thinking about her. Or about land.  Or about you. \nNo, you weren't.  And in the gentlest voice... \nNELS No, someone cheats you, you can rise above that.  You're a family man.  You put them ahead of you, hmmn? \nHe sighs.  But... \nNELS Wasn't you she dishonored. \nAnd the old watering eyes are rock steady now. \nNELS Your father was a strong and tireless man.  Honest to a fault. Kind, and humble as well... \nThere is a silence.  And then... \nKABUO (real quiet) Nice.  When two fellas.  Understand each other. \nThey let that sit. \nNELS Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth... \nKABUO Mr. Gudmundsson, we know what that jury is looking at. \nHe won't let hs eyes lie to this man. \nNELS Your father needs you.  To return to your family. \nSilence. \nNELS So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity. \nKABUO I should show them an American? \nNels sees the rage.  It breaks his heart.  It makes him feel old and helpless. \nNELS Show them an innocent man. \nWhat he stares at now.  Is a neutral mask.  As powerful and opaque as the voice is quiet. \nKABUO Shame you couldn't play chess with my dad, sir.  He'd kick your ass. \nINT. ISHMAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThrough glass, snow is tumbling in endless cascades, the world dwarfed by a descending heaven.  A sound, a strange soft CLICK. PAN across... \n...the small, well-kept bachelor apartment.  Neat stacks of books on the floor, catching the overflow of shelves crammed full. Someone likes to read.  Another soft CLICK.  To... \n...the kitchen now, along the floor.  An awkward high-top SHOE, its buckled straps above elastic LACES that fasten across the instep. The shoe steps on a crude wooden PEDAL.  And we hear another CLICK. PAN up along a vertical strip of mesh WIRE to... \n...a plywood CONTRAPTION, held by a partially closed drawer.  A piece of spring steel holding a set of NAIL CLIPPERS. \nIshmael inserts his pinkie carefully.  CLICK.  Finishes clipping the fingernails of his only hand.  And looks out.  At the magic of white. \nEXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY \nSafe within their haven, the 18-year-olds kiss and hold each other urgently.  Their tongues exploring each other's mouth, her legs open beneath her skirt, pressing her body up against him. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I gave her all of my soul to love. I knew someday we would live in France.  Italy.  Somewhere.  Far from the things that upset her. \nANGLE...later, they lie so quietly.  Her head nestled in the crook of his arm, he gently plays with her hair.  Her face so still, so thoughtful and grave. \nISHMAEL (a murmur) You don't have to be so tragic, you know. \nAh.  Her dark eyes flicker. \nHATSUE (dry) Kind of magical, the way you know how to comfort a girl. \nShe cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his. \nHATSUE I can just feel my spirits soar. \nISHMAEL Well, I don't do it for just anybody. \nAnd kisses her head.  But her eyes still stare off into the tangle of her worries.  He draws a breath... \nISHMAEL There can't be any wrong in this, Ha... \nHATSUE I lie to my parents every day. And every night. \nHis light tone against the fear... \nAGENT These are real nice things. They'll take special care of 'em. \nHisao sees his wife's sudden alarm.  And, as respectfully as he can manage... \nHISAO The flute is precious.  The kimono, the music.  Must you take th... \nAGENT ...oh yeh, any old country stuff, we have to take. \nAnd sees on the sofa, an open album.  Strolls over. \nFUJIKO This is only my daughter's scrapbook.  For her memories. \nSo he picks it up.  Doesn't see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway... \nAGENT (calling out) Wilson?  Don't go pawing through the underwear! \nAnd chuckles.  He knows they appreciate a joke.  It means there's nothing to be afraid of.  Stops turning pages now.  Looks up, his eyes moving until they find Hatsue. \nAGENT Strawberry Princess, huh?  You musta been flattered by that. Looks just like y... \nThe soft slamming of a screen door.  Another AGENT, large and shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate.  And a telling look. \nAGENT #2 (quiet triumph) Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks. \nAnd the crate BANGS onto the table.  Just beside the kimono.  Lifts out two sticks and holds them high.  Proof. \nHISAO You must believe.  This for tree stumps.  For clearing land. \nThe small man's smile fades now.  First time.  And his eyes fix Hisao before he speaks.  As if reading his mind. \nAGENT Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still bad, y'see. \nFujiko slips her hand into her husband's.  To give him strength. \nAGENT It's illegal contraband, you were s'posed to turn this stuff in. We, uh... \nSlight shrug. \nAGENT We gotta arrest you.  Have to take you to Seattle. \nFujiko's breath catches.  One of the daughters whimpers.  The silence hangs thick and frightening.  The bigger agent unhooks a pair of handcuffs from his belt, but... \nAGENT Naw, you don't need those.  Mister Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act, a real gentleman. \nThe younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters.  The agent regrets this. \nFUJIKO Please, reconsider.  He has done no bad th... \nAGENT Well, nobody knows that yet, do they?  So, best for an honest man to clear his name for godd and all. \nAin't that right? \nAGENT Only a few questions in Seattle, okay?  Few questions, few answers, the whole thing is over. \nHe puts his hand on Hisao's arm.  Not roughly, but much firmer than the ease of his voice... \nAGENT Simple as that. \nINT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT \nEight pages of a letter, carefully written in Kanji characters, folded neatly on a table. \nFUJIKO (O.S.) Why do I read you this distres- sing letter?  From your father. From this hakujin...work camp, it is called.  In Montana. \nPULL BACK to see mother and five daughters around the table.  Even the youngest girls somber, attentive.  As if they have aged these past few weeks. \nFUJIKO Because you need to know the darkness.  In the hearts of the hakuj... \nHATSUE (blurts) Not all of them. \nThe silent wake of her outburst, her interruption, lingers.  Her mother studies her. \nFUJIKO The whites are enslaved by their egos, Hatsue.  Each believes his aloneness is everything.  We seek union wi... \nHATSUE ...the ones seeking union with the Greater Life bombed Pearl Harbor. They are not humble.  I am not part of them, I'm part of here. \nHer voice so loud, so insistent.  Her sisters are afraid for her. To have shown such disrespect.  They look down at their hands.  Or away, as if not hearing. \nFUJIKO (quietly, slowly) I see this.  This lack of purity is a mist around your soul.  I see it every day, it haunts your face in unguarded moments. \nThe room is still as the grave.  The mother's eyes burn silently. \nFUJIKO I see it in your eagerness to leave here.  And walk the woods. In the afternoon. \nWhat does she know?  Hatsue's heart pounding.  And to her surprise, her mother's voice softens... \nFUJIKO If you lose your true self, Hatsue. True self... \nThe stern warning, the unrelenting judgement, has become a plea. \nFUJIKO There is no way back. \nINT. ISHMAEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nIshmael washing his supper plate.  His fork and knife.  His coffee mug.  His skillet.  Hard labor with one hand.  And as he works, he looks at... \n...the window above his sink.  Darkness and moonlit snow.  And his own reflection.  CLOSE on his face in the glass, and MATCH DISSOLVE to... \nINT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - NIGHT \n...Arthur Chambers.  Weary.  Worn behind the smile of knowing ease, as he sips coffee from a mug of his own. \nHis boy sits across from him in the silent press room.  Feet up, reading their paper.  Its headline, ISLAND JAPANESE ACCEPT ARMY MANDATE TO MOVE. \nISHMAEL See, you bring it on yourself. 23 ladies honored by the PTA, you single out three names.  And they're all Japanese.  That isn't journalism. \nARTHUR (quietly) Because...? \nIshmael has heard this gently prodding word all his life.  He sighs. \nISHMAEL Because journalism.  Is just the facts. \nARTHUR Which facts?  You can't print them all.  Journalism is balance. Finding the facts folks need to know. \n...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors file toward the ferry.  A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.  And just as they reach the gangway... \n...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance, among a group of students.  She pauses.  Her eyes hold his for a heartbeat... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) ...with some exceptions. \nThe wisp of a smile.  And she is gone. \nEXT. IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nHatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.  Snow is no longer falling.  She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively. The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain impenetrability of her Asian exterior.  She closes her eyes, and... \n...draws deep on the smoke.  The act seems to cause her pain.  When the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.  Nowhere to turn. The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto the snow.  Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her feet against the cold, the helplessness.  And looks out... \n...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered moonlight, become... \nEXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT \n...a moonlit DESERT.  PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks, the desolation.  Come to... \n...two women walking alone.  The younger one glancing at her mother as they go.  Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead. The barracks, everything, in distance behind them. \nHATSUE You think we're far enough away now? \nNo sarcasm in the voice.  She lets the words carry her irony. Her mother stops.  Looks at her so directly, so strong.  Even her tough-minded daughter flinches slightly. \nHATSUE Mom, whatever this is, they don't keep war secrets this carefully. \nFujiko thinks that over.  Nods. \nFUJIKO Secrets are hard to keep. \nShe goes over to a large, flat rock.  Sits down.  Pulls two sheets of paper from her coat.  And waits.  As her daughter comes and crouches at her feet.  Fujiko clears her throat. \nFUJIKO This letter.  Was opened. By mistake. \nAnd watches.  As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask. Silence.  Then... \nFUJIKO (reads) 'My love.  I still go to our cedar tree in the afternoons every day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.' \nHatsue has turned to stone.  To ice.  Wind blows. \nFUJIKO (reads) 'I smell your smell.  And I dream of you.  And I ache for you to come home.  So I can hold you and feel you near.' \nFujiko scans the page silently.  Turns to the second... \nFUJIKO (reads) 'After all these years that we've been together, I find you're a part of me.  Without you, I have nothing.  All my love, forever...' \nAnd looks up.  Her eyes calm, quiet. \nFUJIKO The neighborhood boy.  Who taught you to swim? \nThe look holds.  And holds. \nHATSUE You shouldn't have opened that. It was mi... \nFUJIKO (so quiet) How deceitful of me. \nAnger only at the edges.  Like finely-honed steel. \nFUJIKO How can I ever hope.  For your forgiveness. \nThe wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.  They seem not to notice. \nFUJIKO I have written this letter to the boy's parents... \nShe pulls out a single page.  Hands it down to her daughter. Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words. \nFUJIKO Attraction is no crime, certainly among children.  The dishonor lies in the concealment.  From your families. \nWatches her daughter reading.  And quietly... \nFUJIKO I know that you know this.  I know you have suffered.  Even if the hakujin could not. \nSilence.  Hatsue's eyes cast down.  She folds the page. \nFUJIKO There will be no further letters. No contact of any k... \nAnd stops.  Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.  She looks up.  Into her mother's shock. \nHATSUE One more letter.  I will write it.  You may read it, and send it for me. \nHer mother's anger fades.  Into interest. \nHATSUE I deceived more than you.  I deceived this sweet boy.  And myself.  It was never love. \nNever love.  The mother's face changes.  There is understanding, acceptance.  Even pride. \nHATSUE I will work hard.  To earn your forgiveness. \nA sigh.  A sadness deep, beyond her years. \nHATSUE I can never hope for his. \nINT. BARRACKS - NIGHT \nMother and daughter enter their crude quarters.  They find Hatsue's sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching... \n...a team of young MEN, working with tools and pieces of lumber. One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers.  Their leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the floor.  One girl beams at her mother... \nSUMIKO These boys are buildings us a mansion! \nThe leader grins and rises.  Bows slightly to Fujiko.  He is, of course... \nKABUO I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada. \nThe woman smiles.  Bows slightly in return. \nFUJIKO We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san. How are your parents, your family...? \nKABUO My father is sick with the camp food.  The rest of us are fine. Don't speak of dept, please, we just want to help. \nAnd glances.  To the eldest daughter.  In the doorway. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) It was all I could think of to say. \nHis eyes squeeze shut. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) There was nothing more to say. For a long while. \nINT. KABUO'S CELL - LATE NIGHT \nCLOSE on a dark blue suit.  Clean shirt.  Hanging on a hook against the green wall.  PAN ACROSS the bars in the cell door's tiny window.  All is dark out there, and silent.  Here... \n...the bare bulb glows.  Its light throws shadows of castles and horses across the chessboard. \nKabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone.  His back erect.  His eyes calm.  Stare at the pieces. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nKabuo at 19 sits on the earth.  By a shovel.  By a lantern.  This place is shielded by trees.  PAN across the ground to... \n...his father.  Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.  Wooden swords, hakama pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.  Dialogue plays in subtitled JAPANESE... \nZENHICHI Your great-grandfather was a samurai, a magnificent soldier. \nThe father never looks at the son.  Only at his work. \nZENHICHI He killed himself.  On the battlefield.  At Kumamoto. \nThe boy knows this.  Yet his entire being is focused on every word. \nZENHICHI He went to battle with a sword. Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing what honor required. \nAn elegant SWORD.  Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light. \nZENHICHI He was angry.  To the point of being crazy, yes.  But he knew what honor.  Required. \nA separate sack, just for this.  Folded with respect. \nZENHICHI Honor can require loyalty. Revenge.  Death. \nIt goes into the ground.  With the others.  He seems nearly overcome now.  By some emotion that sweeps through him.  Prompting the boy to murmur... \nKABUO These are safe, father.  The hakujin will never f... \nZENHICHI (quietly) ...it is the only scale... \nMeaning, be still.  So the boy is still. \nZENHICHI Only scale.  In which our worth. Is weighed. \nThe man gazes into the hole.  At his treasures. \nZENHICHI Every life ends.  And if it ends dishonored.  It is as if... \nAnd turns to his son.  To complete the words. \nKABUO (in English) ...we have never lived. \nThere is love.  There is strength.  There is no more to say. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nSheriff Moran sits in the witness box, blade-thin and fidgeting ever so slightly.  Uncomfortable in the limelight.  In his hands are four pieces of ROPE. \nMORAN Well, this one here comes off Miyamoto's boat.  Matches all his others, worn equal and so on.  But this one here... \nHolds it up for Hooks.  So the jury can see. \nMORAN ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest. \nHOOKS And the next one...? \nMORAN From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. \nHOOKS And the last...? \nMORAN Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect. \nAh.  Hooks nods.  Significant. \nHOOKS So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up? \nMORAN You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat. \nHOOKS And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference? \nMORAN Pretty darn clear. \nI see.  Hooks begins to pace.  Toward the jury. \nHOOKS And when you visited defendant on his boat.  The evening after Carl Heine's death.  Did it seem pretty darn clear to him? \nEXT. THE ISLANDER - NIGHT \nKabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.  He is sliding a new BATTERY into place.  Beside its older companion.  He bolts it down.  Starts his engine.  He is visibly tense.  As he steps onto the deck, he sees... \n...two figures at the pilings.  Sheriff Moran makes a cutting motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line. \nMORAN Cut your engine, we're coming aboard. \nKabuo doesn't move.  The tension has fled beneath the surface.  His face now a mask. \nKABUO What for, Sheriff? \nMORAN We have a warrant.  To search your boat. \nHe holds it up.  Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything. \nKABUO Well, what are you looking f... \nMORAN (calmly) A murder weapon.  We think you might be responsible for the death of Carl Heine. \nKabuo blinks.  As if hearing a foreign language.  Words that do not compute. \nKABUO Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl, it sure as hell wasn't me. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows. \nIshmael rises, stiffly.  Starts to pull on his coat. \nLEVANT You get what you come for? \nAnd Ishmael looks at the youngster.  A little oddly.  Admits... \nISHMAEL Guess I'm not completely sure. What that was. \nEXT. FLETCHER'S BAY - MORNING \nIshmael at 24, crouched among trees.  Above a sunlit stretch of beach. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I left the grocery, and wrote a letter.  I apologizes from my heart. I should never have said that word to her.  I never would again. \nCLOSE on his face.  Eyes gazing down.  At something. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) It sat in my desk for two weeks. Before I threw it away. \nHe sighs.  Rises slowly. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I knew her car.  And sometimes when I'd see it, I'd...drive that way.  At a distance. \nSee Hatsue down on the beach.  Alone, raking for steamer clams. Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella. \nIshmael walks down to the sand.  Crosses to where she works.  And squats down.  At a respectful distance. \nISHMAEL Can I talk to you? \nShe must have seen who was coming.  Because the words do not startle her.  Or slow her work. \nHATSUE I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t... \nISHMAEL There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you. \nHer back is to him.  She is motionless. \nISHMAEL Don't you owe me that? \nAnd she turns.  Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.  Then she walks over, and sinks to the sand.  Just before him.  Near enough to touch. \nShe looks in his eyes.  And waits. \nISHMAEL I'm like a dying person. \nThe words just came out.  His eyes move over her face.  His aching for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope. \nISHMAEL I don't sleep.  I tell myself this can't go on, but it goes on anyway. \nHe seems at the edge of insanity.  Or tears. \nHATSUE I did a terrible thing, Ishmael. I knew what you felt.  And what I didn't. \nSadness in her voice.  But strength as well. \nHATSUE And I never found the courage to tell you. \nHis eyes swim with tears.  He chokes them back, he has to. \nISHMAEL You'll think this is crazy, but all I want is to hold you.  Just once. And smell your hair. \nShe absorbs this.  No sign of repulsion or anger.  Her eyes seem wise.  And very sad. \nHATSUE You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go. \nISHMAEL Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again. \nShe just keeps looking at him.  There is a bravery to her steady gaze.  Her calm resolve. \nISHMAEL Please?  As one human being to another, just because I'm miserable and don't know where to turn.  I need to be in your arms.  If it's just for thirty seconds. \nHis pleading look holds her for a moment.  In the silence... \nHATSUE I hurt for you.  Whether you'll ever believe that or not. \nFeeling behind her eyes.  First time she lets it show. \nHATSUE I feel sick sometimes, with the guilt of what I've done to you. And I can't make it right. \nShe rises slowly.  Brushes the sand from her skirt. \nHATSUE To hold you would be wrong and deceitful.  You're going to have to live without holding me, that is the truth of the way things are. \nShe takes one step back. \nHATSUE Things end.  They do.  Get on with your life. \nAnd turns away.  She gathers her baby in her arms.  Takes her blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.  He watches, never moving, as she gathers her things.  Gathers them as if he wasn't there.  And with her back turned... \nHATSUE Get on with your life. \nShe walks slowly away.  Her baby cries. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCLOSE on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove.  A woman's hand stirs with a wooden ladle.  PULL BACK to see... \nHELEN CHAMBERS, slender and strong and keen.  She is not yet 60.  A code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned features. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I drove from the lighthouse to my mother's place.  I brought her some groceries. \nBeyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever.  Silent. Spellbinding. \nHELEN Your father thought that heavy snow was God's kindness.  Despite the hardship, it brought us beauty... \nIshmael at the rustic table.  Watching her back. \nHELEN ...and reminded us.  Of our place in things. \nSofter.  Not bitter, but regretful that... \nHELEN You don't believe in God anymore. \nHATSUE (V.O.) The last time.  At the cedar tree. I knew we could never be right together.  And that soon I would have to tell you. \nHis eyes are dry.  The letter has used up his tears long ago. \nHATSUE (V.O.) This is the last time I will write to you.  I am not yours anymore. \nHe sets the letter on the bed beside him. \nHATSUE (V.O.) I wish you the very best.  Your heart is large and you are gentle and kind.  I know you will do great things in the world. \nHe reaches now to his inside coat pocket.  Withdrawing... \nHATSUE (V.O.) I must say good-bye to you now. Our lives will move on.  The best we can. \n...a page.  Folded in quarters.  Sets it near the letter. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Milholland's report was like her letter.  Something no one else. Would ever read. \nHe stares at them.  Side by side. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Thing about having only one hand. It's hard to tear pages up.  And I wasn't carrying a match. \nHe lies back.  Across the bed. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) So I thought of my father.  The man who would have taken this report to Judge Fielding. \nTears stand in his eyes. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) But every reporter.  Chooses his own balance.  FInds the facts that matter. \nShuts the eyes.  Against them.  Against everything. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) After all, the freighter was only a theory.  It proved nothing at all.  There were other facts. That mattered. \nWe CLOSE on his face.  The tightness of the muscles. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Tomorrow I would write a column. About prejudice.  And she would be grateful.  For my large...and gentle...heart. \nThe eyes open, they are blank.  Staring... \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Her husband would be judged.  And she would be alone. \n...at the future. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Alone.  The past looks different. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHatsue Miyamoto in the witness box. Graceful, erect, her porcelain beauty accessible, eager to cooperate.  Humble. \nHATSUE Hopeful.  Is the word I would use. \nAnd Nels seems slightly surprised. \nNELS But Carl didn't say yes. \nHATSUE He didn't say no.  That was Kabuo's point.  Given how Carl's mother felt, Carl was still willing to consider selling to us.  It was a good sign. \nNels considers that. \nNELS Well, in the week that followed, the week before Carl's death... did your husband pursue him? \nHATSUE No.  Kabuo did not wish to beg, he respected Carl's right to reflect.  He was sure Carl would do the honorable thing. \nNELS (right back) And did he? \nShe nods.  Only once.  Her eyes bright. \nHATSUE The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped Carl at sea.  With his dead battery. \nNels raises his eyebrows.  To give the point its weight. \nHATSUE Right there, on the boat, they agreed.  $8400 for the seven acres, $800 down.  They shook on it.  Kabuo was so excited when he came home. \nNels lets that sit.  And sit. \nNELS And when did you first learn. That Carl had drowned? \nThe slightest pause.  As if hesitant to confess... \nHATSUE One o'clock, that afternoon, from a clerk at Petersen's. \nNELS (turning to Hooks) Your witness. \nAnd Alvin Hooks rises.  Perches on the edge of the prosecutor's table.  And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion. \nHOOKS Your husband came home agitated, after his encounter with the deceased? \nNo impatience across her perfect features.  Only earnestness will do. \nHATSUE I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed. \nHOOKS You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news? \nHATSUE Happy for him.  And relieved. \nHOOKS So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes? \nHATSUE (calm, respectful) No. \nHOOKS Really?  Didn't call your mother, your sisters, about starting a new life.  Your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated. \nHatsue shifts in her chair.  Smooths her skirt. \nHATSUE We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later. \nHOOKS Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock? \nHATSUE Closer to eight. \nHOOKS So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'. \nShe nods, he was. \nGILLANDERS Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog. \nNELS All right, what if the defendant heard?  So Carl let him aboard, to help.  And then the fishing gaff? \nGillanders grins.  Wide. \nGILLANDERS You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him? \nNELS Well, what if? \nGILLANDERS Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so. \nAnother chuckle or two from the gallery. \nNELS Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather. \nGILLANDERS Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks. \nAnd looks at the prosecutor.  Who rises, easily.  A most polite fuck-you smile.  Hooks strolls now.  Slow and steady.  Straight to the witness box.  Rests his hands on the rail.  Leans in. \nHOOKS What if the defendant follows Carl. And pretends his own batteries are dead?  Would Carl tie up and help? \nAnd the smile on Gillander's face.  Stops.  Cold. \nHOOKS Is the word you're groping for...'yes', perha... \nJUDGE (O.S.) Alvin! \nHOOKS Rephrase.  Do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant's bo... \nGILLANDERS So why's the D-6 in Carl's well? \nHOOKS Who's to say?  Maybe it was just a spare, after all.  Or maybe the defendant left it, as a potential alibi.  In case somebody saw him in Ship Channel Bank. (beat) In case we put two and two together, knowing of the hostility. Between the families. \nGillanders.  Actually thinking about that. \nHOOKS My question is.  Could Carl have tied up to help the defendant? \nA beat.  A cleared throat. \nGILLANDERS It coulda happened.  And if I start to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y say 'no further questions', right? \nOnce more, laughter.  Enough to bring the gavel DOWN. \nHOOKS Right about that.  And right that it 'coulda happened'. \nTurns his back, walks away. \nHOOKS Thanks for your help.  Hope the witness box wasn't too warm for your comfort. \nAll eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits.  Except for the defendant.  His stare forward.  Recalling... \nINT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT \nKabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back against the wall.  Leaving the cot.  For his guest. \nNELS But the toughest scenario.  Is the one Hooks will never raise. \nKabuo watching.  Quiet.  Takes a breath... \nKABUO And what's that? \nNELS That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said. \nThe hardest.  Straightest.  Look. \nNELS Only.  He said no. \nSilence. \nNELS And something...happened.  That you'd never planned.  Because you're not a cold-blooded killer. \nNobody flinches.  Nobody blinks. \nKABUO I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai. \nNELS You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge. \nDo you understand? \nNELS So if the jury thinks you did kill. but only in the heat of anger.  They have to acquit. \nDo you? \nNELS And you couldn't.  Be.  Re-tried. \nKabuo's face is stone.  A warrior's mask. \nKABUO You want me to say that. \nNELS I want you.  To tell the truth. \nThere is no kindly smile tonight.  No candy bars. \nKABUO You think that is the truth. \nNELS I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad.  And it's real. \nKABUO And what do you believe? \nNels sighs.  Cocks his head just to one side. \nNELS A question first.  Why do you want to know? \nKABUO (straight back) Because you're my friend. \nThe old man thinks about that.  Studies his client. \nNELS I believe you are a good man.  Who belongs with his family. \nAnd then the feeling comes.  To the watery eyes. \nNELS And I believe.  You didn't do it. \nHOOKS Except even when Sheriff Moran arrested you.  You said nothing about seeing Carl. \nTurns to the jury.  Openly bewildered. \nHOOKS At that point, you were already under suspicion.  The battery story explained things.  If the story was true...and not simply something you thought up later... \nTurns back.  To the defendant. \nHOOKS Why.  Didn't you.  Tell it? \nNo reaction from the defendant.  Nothing anyone can see. \nKABUO Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer... \nHOOKS But even after you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know nothing.  Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct? \nA beat. \nKABUO Yes.  Initially. \nHOOKS Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance! \nSilence. \nKABUO I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it. \nHOOKS Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth. \nWe can just discern the anger.  At the edge of Kabuo's steady gaze. Silence. \nHOOKS Nothing to say? \nKABUO (quietly) I didn't know that was a question. It sounded like a speech. \nAnd Hooks smiles.  Loving it.  Walks toward the witness, stalking him. \nHOOKS My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth? \nKABUO I have told the truth. \nHOOKS You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir. \nKABUO (even quieter) Yes.  And I told it long before this morning. \nHOOKS I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest. \nKABUO I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat. \nHOOKS Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth. \nKABUO Yes. \nHooks leans over the box.  Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space. \nHOOKS Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible? \nKABUO I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up. \nAh.  I see. \nHOOKS Conveniently, in your shed.  Only you didn't mention that a moment ago. Why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised? \nKabuo looks at him, evenly. \nKABUO You asked if I went straight to the boat.  I did.  With the battery. \nHooks steps back.  Looks the witness over. \nHOOKS You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f... \nNELS (O.S.) Objection! \nJUDGE You know better than that, Mr. Hooks.  Either ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with it. \nSilence.  The judge staring hard.  Hooks never flinching. \nJUDGE Shame on you. \nHooks turns his eyes to Kabuo.  Stares him down, so the jury can watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return.  And softly... \nHOOKS I apologize to the court, for letting my feelings get the better of me. \nTurns away. \nHOOKS No other questions.  We'll go to summation. \nAs he returns to his table.  As Kabuo steps down from the box. We PAN... \n...reporters' row.  The boys are writing as fast as their hands can move.  Only Ishmael is not writing at all.  He stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee.  We CLOSE to see... \nOne word circled.  The word 'lantern'. \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nAlvin Hooks stalks the jury box now.  Prowls before them along the rail.  As their eyes follow. \nHOOKS ...believing that Etta Heine's son would never sell him the land.  Land that in his mind, filtered through ancient rules of behavior handed down from his ancestors' culture, belonged to his family by right... \nStops.  To make sure they understand. \nHOOKS His only choice to get the land would be to eliminate Carl Heine. So that Ole Jurgensen would need a new buyer. \nPacing again, hand trailing along the rail... \nHOOKS In his mind.  Seen through codes of revenge difficult for us to fathom, this was also the only way to avenge what he felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father, his family... \nRaises his finger.  This must be heard... \nHOOKS ...to a thousand years of ancestry, in a foreign land we still find an enigma.  Despite our recent bitter experience with its ways. \nAnd stops once more.  Places his hands on the rail. \nHOOKS Thus believing cold-blooded murder to be justified...he trailed Carl Heine... could hear his engine in the fog...and sounded his own horn, claiming distress. \nHATSUE Well, please break them, then. I won't keep you a moment. \nAnd she reaches past him.  To take her husband's hands.  She looks in his eyes, as if they are alone. \nHATSUE I love you.  And tomorrow, when I make our bed.  I'm setting out your pillow. \nTears just flood her eyes.  Sudden, unbidden.  She holds tight to her smile.  And to his hands. \nHATSUE (whispers) You better be there. \nHe smiles.  A lovely, easy, cowboy-American smile. \nKABUO Only if you ask me nice. \nANGLE...from the gallery.  One man watches.  Watches as a woman brings manicled hands to her lips.  And walks quickly away... \n...toward us.  Straight toward us, in fact.  And when she stands before us, her hands mangle her purse.  The eyes are hollow, flint- edged. \nHATSUE Did you write that column? \nISHMAEL I did.  But the jury won't s... \nHATSUE It's not for the.  They only get to convict him. \nShe arches her throat.  As if facing a firing squad. \nHATSUE It's the judge who decides.  If he'll hang. \nHe reaches.  His fingertips find her shoulder.  She does not resist his touch. \nISHMAEL (gently) None of that is gonna ha... \nHATSUE You don't think he did this. \nHis hand comes away.  From his heart... \nISHMAEL I know he didn't. \nShe nods.  Nods.  Her eyes filling.  Moving over his face. \nHATSUE Come to supper, tonight.  My mother would be proud to have you with us. \nHe hears the emotion in her voice.  He swallows hard. \nISHMAEL I can't. \nNo, I can't. \nISHMAEL Tell your mom.  I want a rain check. \nINT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT \nKabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him.  Alone in his mind.  Footfalls.  Kabuo oblivious, far away.  The door CLANGS open. \nMORAN You have a visitor, son. \nTurns to the visitor... \nMORAN You said three minutes. \nISHMAEL Won't take two. \nAnd Moran leaves.  The door CLANGS shut.  They are alone.  Only one man smiling... \nKABUO Please, sit down... \nBut the tall man doesn't.  Doesn't move. \nKABUO She told me you're writing a column.  We're very grateful. \nIshmael nods, awkwardly.  Acknowledging this. \nKABUO She.  Said you two go way back... \nIshmael stares into Kabuo's earnest smile. \nKABUO That's nice. \nISHMAEL You said there was a lantern in his hand.  When you found him in the fog. \nKabuo blinks.  The man's tone is formal.  As if the offer of friendliness is somehow rejected. \nISHMAEL And another one.  Lashed to the mast? \nKabuo's own smile has faded.  The mask has returned. \nKABUO That's right. \nISHMAEL Two.  Lanterns. \nAnd Kabuo grins.  In spite of himself. \nKABUO If I did the math right. \nIshmael leans back.  Against the door. \nISHMAEL It's the sheriff's math.  I'm wondering about. \nINT. SOMMENSEN'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nBlackness.  The sound of wind.  Of water lapping at wood.  CLICK of a key, springing a lock.  The SCRAPE of a large PADLOCK sliding away.  A door CREAKS open, and from the sound of it, a large one. \nGray light seeps in. \nMORAN (O.S.) Blackmail.  That's all it is. \nSee them now.  Three SILHOUETTES framed in thr barn's open doorway. Against the night sky. \nISHMAEL (O.S.) I call it keeping your promise. We said if I ever needed some cooperation from you... \nA soft CLICK, and the LIGHTS go on.  Such as they are.  A few bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle enclosure.  A 50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted timbers.  This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors facing the harbor. \nTwo BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers.  We've seen them before. \nALEXANDER VAN NESS We're not tryin' him for lying.  Lots of us told lies, one time or another. Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody. \nHAROLD JENSEN But what drives a man to lie? Means he's hiding somethin'. \nALEXANDER VAN NESS Not necessarily that he killed Carl.  I'm not sayin' you're wrong, just that I have my doubts. \nBURKE LATHAM Look, if you changed chairs right now, cos you doubted that maybe a chunk of the moon was gonna fall through the roof, that wouldn't be a reasonable doubt. \nFolks turn to Burke.  What the hell are you talking about? \nALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs) Okay, you win that one.  Now can we all go to bed? \nHARLAN McQUEEN The mooring line.  Doesn't that tell you something? \nALEXANDER VAN NESS I think it does.  Miyamoto was on Carl's boat, or vice-versa.  Not much doubt about th... \nMARLAN McQUEEN And Carl's blood on the gaff? \nALEXANDER VAN NESS There's a chance it came from his hand. \nBURKE LATHAM There's a chance of everything. But you add a chance from here and a chance from there, the world ain't made a coincidences only. \nEveryone agrees.  Almost everyone. \nEDITH TWARDZIK Look, if he gave Carl a battery like he said, he'd only a had one left.  Not two. \nALEXANDER VAN NESS He explained that.  He replaced it. \nHARLAN McQUEEN Only he threw that part in when he got cornered.  But first time around, he never mentioned it. \nROGER PORTER Alex, stop arguin' just to argue. You can see what really happened, same as us.  Isn't that what we're supposed to do is tell the actual truth?  My God, Carl died, here. \nALEXANDER VAN NESS So I don't care Carl died, unless I'm ready to reach for the hangman's rope?  You oughta stop tryin' to bully me into hurrying. \nLittle anger in that.  It brings a silence. \nBURKE LATHAM Been six hours.  You sayin' there's a way to go slower? \nINT. NELS' KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT \nNels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle into mismatched cups.  His hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy. He COUGHS horrible.  CLEARS his throat... \nNELS Well.  It's imaginative... \nAnd drops tea bags into the cups with a splash. \nNELS ...I'll give you that. \nLisps over to the cluttered table.  Where his guest is waiting. \nISHMAEL It's the way it happened, I know it is. \nNELS No, you don't. \nNels sits.  Slowly.  Ishmael removes his bag.  Sips his tea. \nNELS That report.  About the freighter? You didn't find that tonight, did you? \nNo answer.  Ishmael keeps sipping.  Holding eye contact. \nNELS You went right to the cell.  Then to the boat.  Then here.  How long did you know about the freighter? \nISHMAEL (just above a whisper) One day. \nNels' turn.  To sip his tea. \nNELS This tastes horrible, hmmn? \nISHMAEL You're wondering why I held it. \nNELS I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night. \nAnd he smiles.  A wonderful smile. \nNELS Your daddy.  Was quite a feller. \nISHMAEL Yes, he was. \nAnother sip. \nNELS He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts. \nISHMAEL To my father.  Everything counts. \nNels watches the pain in that. \nNELS What if I told you he once said to me...don't matter the road we take.  Just so we get there. \nISHMAEL (smiles) Then you'd be lying. \nNELS Doesn't make me wrong. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe jury once more in the jury box.  PAN their faces.  The faces we saw last night. \nNELS (O.S.) All right, let's say that twine had been there to lash a lantern. That it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceased's pocket. \nEdith Twardzik.  Burke Latham.  Alexander Van Ness. \nNELS (O.S.) Now to re-open a trial that had gone to jury...new evidence should be pretty important. \nSee Ishmael.  Quiet, intense.  On the witness stand. \nNELS (O.S.) Tell us why that lantern would be so significant. \nISHMAEL Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern. \nNels thinks about that.  So the jury will, too. \nNELS Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast. \nISHMAEL That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case. \nAnd just strolls on over to his seat.  Looks in his client's eyes. How 'bout them apples?  Kabuo loves this old guy.  And right here, he lets a little of that show. \nAcross the way, the prosector is rising.  He smiles.  Friendly, almost amused. \nHOOKS I have to start reading your paper more closely.  You're quite a storyteller. \nISHMAEL (straight back) Thank you.  Coming from the man who wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog, I plead for your help'...that's quite a compliment. \nThere is a ripple of laughter.  But no smile on Ishmael's features. His game face is on.  Come and get me, sucker.  And Hooks does come, one step at a time.  Straight to the box. \nHOOKS Everything had to happen just right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons. \nISHMAEL I'm sorry, was there a question in there? \nNo love lost.  And no pretense about it.  Hatsue Miyamoto sits with her hand in her mother's.  Watching these men battle for her husband's life. \nHOOKS Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's eleven things... \nISHMAEL Twelve. \nHooks smiles. \nHOOKS I stand corrected, sir.  And you have a neat explanation for every one of them. \nHooks nods.  Yes, you do. \nHOOKS And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts? \nISHMAEL My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist. \nRight at his eyes. \nISHMAEL And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding the facts folks need to know. \nThe words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot fully appreciate. \nISHMAEL Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed. \nHOOKS But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces. \nISHMAEL Oh, yes. \nAnd the prosecutor stops.  Confused for an instant by this confession.  Until... \nISHMAEL But no other way.  To explain them all. \nA heart-stopping hush.  As everyone, as Hooks himself, sees the cehckmate. \nISHMAEL And since they all happened. This is the only explanation that's the truth. \nThe prosecutor looks like he's been slapped.  Like every act of will is necessary to maintain composure.  To find the easy, untroubled smile. \nHOOKS Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth. \nISHMAEL Like you couldn't believe. \nService returned.  Hooks leans in. \nHOOKS Well, the defendant is a liar. He's confessed that much.  And his explanation is...he was afraid. \nAnd leans in some more. \nHOOKS Afraid that the good folks of this jury.  Would be too stupid to understand.  Too prejudiced to be fair. \nShakes his head. \nHOOKS You buy that? \nISHMAEL (gently) I think he was greedy. \nAnd once more.  The prosecutor can only blink.  Can only move toward the trap. \nHOOKS Greedy. \nISHMAEL He didn't want to lose any more. \nNo smile.  No smile as the trap springs shut. \nISHMAEL He'd lost a lot in the war, you see.  I had sent him away.  To a concentration camp.  But a nice one.  Far less brutal than the Nazis. Because I'm a civilized person. \nHe stops.  Lets Hooks clear his throat. \nHOOKS I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h... \nISHMAEL That's how journalists.  Answer questions. \nTurns to Judge Fielding.  With all respect... \nISHMAEL May I answer the question, Your Honor?  Anout the defendant's motivation to lie? \nJUDGE I wouldn't miss it for the world, son.  Now, you say you sent the defendant to Manzanar? \nISHMAEL I didn't say.  I did it alone. \nAnd things get real quiet. \nISHMAEL So there he was.  His father lost his health there, finally died. They lost more than Etta Heine's seven acres.  They lost their liberty, their dignity.  Their ideals about this country. \nSo much feeling in this.  He has to stop.  Swallow hard. \nISHMAEL They lost their trust in us.  We had treated them worse than animals. How would we now see tham.  As human beings? \nTells the jury.  Straight to their faces. \nISHMAEL This man lost a lot in the war. He didn't want now to lose his babies.  Or the woman who loves him. \nAnother level of quiet.  He turns to the prosecutor... \nISHMAEL And my expertise in this, sir.  Is that I lost a lot in the war myself. \nWords coming from someplace very deep. \nISHMAEL And the fact that I am the only witness.  Who placed his right hand upon the Holy Bible.  Is the least of it, sir.  I assure you of that. \nThere it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other cigarette to his lips.  And Ishmael takes out the match box.  Never breaking eye contact. \nISHMAEL We don't let go, you s... \nNELS It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point. \nExpertly, Ishmael's fingers withdaw a match. \nNELS You gave this jury three chances. To turn. \nPalming the box, Ishmael STRIKES the match.  On his belt buckle... \nNELS No other way to explain it all. That was one.  I caught some of 'em fluttering, waking up, on that. \nReaches the flame toward the old man... \nNELS Second.  You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone.  I liked that one, they didn't.  No surprise. \nNels leans to the flame.  Sucks it in.  Savors a drag. \nNELS Last.  You gave your arm.  To buy this woman back her husband. Are they gonna cheat you out of that? \nBAILIFF (O.S., calling out) JURY'S COMIN' IN... \nEverywhere, the buzz RISES, there is motion an expectation.  But Nels doesn't seem to notice. \nNELS Some let go, some don't.  Where did you? \nAsked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now, surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm. \nISHMAEL (a murmur) Hooks called her deceitful. And I knew she wasn't. \nHe's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently. \nISHMAEL She was an honest person.  Doing the best she could. \nWe follow her approach toward the courtroom door.  She has not yet turned to us. \nNELS (O.S.) The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off.  She was desperate.  Her husband helpless...I was helpless... \nNels rises.  With great effort. \nNELS You couldn't let her.  Be helpless. \nIshmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her mother's murmurings, as she... \n...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way. \nNELS When this verdict is read.  She may look for your face. \nAnd Ishmael's eyes come up.  Because the voice commands it. \nNELS Here's what she needs to see:  This is nothing.  We win it on appeal. \nThe old man is stern and strong.  He wants a promise. \nISHMAEL It'll be there. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nThe hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one coughs, no one blinks... \nJUDGE (clears his throat) Mister foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? \nHe looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury box. \nHAROLD JENSEN We have, Your Honor. \nAnd holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded once. \nJUDGE Will the bailiff please bring the verdict to the bench. \nThe bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and... \n...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and as he hands it back to the bailiff... \nJUDGE (softly) Will the defendant please rise. \nKabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either man.  But something passes, all the same. \nAs the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we SNAP TO... \nREVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman, now opening the slip of paper. \nEvery pair.  But one. \nJUDGE (O.S.) Will the foreman please read the verdict aloud. \nOne reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines. Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes. To be waiting. \nHAROLD JENSEN (reads) We the jury, find the defendant, Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not guilty of the cri... \nA sharp SCREAM, and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth in embarrassment. \nHAROLD JENSEN (continues) ...of the crime with which he has been char... \nAPPLAUSE breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum, as has... \n...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now... \n...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.  Others look awkward, not knowing how to react. \nThe gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem with anything that is taking place right now.  Saying only to the jury... \nJUDGE This is your verdict, so say you all? \nAs they assent... \nJUDGE This Court thanks you for the good work you have done under difficult circumstances... \nReaches STRONG to the gavel, turns to the defendant... \nJUDGE Go home, son.  God bless. \n", "test1_input": "HOOKS (O.S.) ...you were acquainted with the defendant and his family. \nETTA HEINE is a linebacker in a dress.  Stout and German and wary. She is 57, and pulls her hem down tight below her knees. \nETTA Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first. \nHOOKS So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then. \nETTA They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend. \nSaid not with pride, but regret. \nHOOKS But the dispute began.  With the father, yes? \nINT. HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY \nEtta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.  Carl is a huge rawboned man, and puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that. Etta knows trouble when she sees it. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nEtta pours her husband's coffee.  It is very quiet. \nETTA Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it. \nCARL SR. Only seven acres, and the worst seven, at that.  They're decent folks.  They got five hunnerd to put down now. \nETTA Don't go wavin' new church clothes at me.  We're not such paupers as sell to Japs, are we?  For what, a pouch of fancy pipe tobacco? \nShe walks about the kitchen with her arms folded.  Too upset to be still. \nCARL SR. They work hard, live clean, don't spend nothin'.  Even kind to the Indjuns.  People is people, comes down to it. \nEtta turns sharply.  Glares at the big man.  He just blinks blandly, puffs his pipe.  She can see this ship has sailed. \nETTA You wear the pants, doncha?  Go ahead, sell our land to a Jap and see what comes of it. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks pacing, slow and calm.  This part needs to be clear. \nHOOKS But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land.  So...? \nETTA Carl held it for 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December... \nHOOKS Why?  If they could never take title. \nETTA Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it. \nShe folds her hands.  Looks Kabuo square in the eye. \nETTA But they missed their last two payments.  So that was that. \nINT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY \nCarl Sr. and Zenhichi sit at the table.  There is coffee.  But it is untouched.  Etta watches by the stove. \nETTA (V.O.) March 1942, orders came down.  Japs had eight days before the Army was gonna cart 'em off. \nCarl lights his pipe.  Compassion in his broad weathered face. \nCARL SR. (softly) Eight days.  It ain't right. \nZENHICHI We must leave everything.  If you like, you can work our fields, sell berries, keep the money.  Otherwise, they just rot. \nETTA (V.O.) Japs are shrewd.  Offer berries he can't use.  Soften us up about those two payments still to come. \nAnd sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills.  Puts them on the table. \nZENHICHI Today, I have $120 toward next paym... \nCARL SR. Absolutely not, Zenhichi.  I'm not gonna take your savings at a time like this. \nThe small man spreads the bills out.  On the table. \nZENHICHI Please, you take.  Then, I send more from where I'm going.  If not enough, you still have seven acres strawber... \nETTA Thought you was givin' us those. \nAnd everything.  Stops. \nETTA Didn't you come in here givin' them away?  Now you want $130, after our labor and fertilizer.  Is that what you come here hopin' on? \nZenhichi keeps his anger within.  His face is stone. \nETTA (V.O.) I spit on him, and he's pretending it didn't happen that way.  How could anyone trust people like that? \nETTA You want more coffee? \nZENHICHI No, thank you.  Take money, please. \nBut Carl is staring at his wife.  She stares right back.  Carl turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi. \nCARL SR. Etta's been rude to you, and I apologize for that.  You keep this money, and those payments will work out fine.  Somewhere down the road. \nINT. PARLOR - TWILIGHT \nSilence.  Palpable.  Two figures sit at opposite ends of this darkening room, each under a lamp.  Carl Sr. is reading the paper. His face is stone.  Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills and ledgers.  Her face is angry. \nA screen door opens.  Slams shut.  Big footfalls coming.  No one looks up. \nCARL JR. Look at this! \nHe stands in the doorway.  A bamboo fishing road in his giant hand. \nCARL JR. Kabuo loaned it to me.  Til he gets back. \nAnd his parents stare back him. \nCARL JR. It's great for sea-run cutthroat. The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped. \nETTA Take that back.  And do it now. \nThe big young face is stunned, hurt. \n", "test1_true": "ETTA Those Japs owe us.  I don't want nothin' confusing that. \nThe boy looks to his father.  Who says nothing. \nETTA I said now, boy.  Supper's in forty minutes. \nCrestfallen, defeated, the boy backs away.  Hear his footfalls. The screen door SLAM hard. \nAnd Carl Sr. looks at his wife.  No sound, until... \nCARL SR. We ain't right together. \nThe words are flat and straight.  Etta stoic. \nCARL SR. You and me.  We just ain't right. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks settles back.  His butt on the edge of the prosecutor's table.  The soul of patience and clarity. \nHOOKS You said neither of the last two payments were made.  But your husband told defendant's father that he could pay them...what, 'down the road'. \nAnd straight back... \nETTA Road ended October 1944, when my husband passed away. \nShe nods.  That's all there was to it. \nETTA I sold all the land to our neighbor, Ole Jurgensen.  Got a fair price, this time.  And... \nStraightens her spine.  To deliver the clincher... \nETTA Sent all their equity back to those Japs down in California.  Which I didn't have to do.  Specially since my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin' shot at by Japs at the time. \nHooks pauses.  As if drinking this in. \nHOOKS Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity. \nETTA In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they? \nKabuo watching the woman.  Eyes as hard as her own. \nHOOKS And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps. \nETTA Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son. \nINT. ETTA'S APARTMENT, AMITY HARBOR - DAY \nKabuo stands at the open door.  No one is inviting him inside. \nETTA He's over the ocean, fighting the Japs.  They're just about licked. \nKABUO (quietly) Just about. \nAnd there it sits. \nETTA When Mr. Heine passed away, I couldn't farm the place myself, could I?  You're gonna have to talk to Ole abou... \nKABUO I just did.  He didn't know we were one payment away.  You didn't tell him Mr. Heine promised my fath... \nETTA I was s'posed to tell him there's some illegal contract muddling things up?  You folks didn't make your pay- ments.  In America, bank comes in and repossesses your land.  I didn't do anything wrong. \nKabuo stands.  Calm, unblinking. \nKABUO Nothing illegal.  Wrong is a different mat... \nETTA Get out of here. \nKABUO You sold our land out from under us, Mrs. Heine.  You took advantage of the fact that we were gone.  You... \nSLAMM.  The door has closed in his face.  And Kabuo stands there. As if deciding. \nWhether to break it down. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks standing at the jury box now.  Looking at them, as he asks... \nHOOKS What do you mean by 'dirty looks'? \nETTA Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face. \nHOOKS When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this? \nETTA That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him. \nHOOKS Did he see some danger from defen... \nNELS Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind. \nHOOKS All right.  What did your son say to that effect? \nShe looks up.  As if trying to recall. \nETTA He said he wished Kabuo would forget about his seven acres, and stop lookin' at us cross-eyed. \nHooks stares at the jury.  Holds the moment. \nHOOKS Your witness. \nAnd goes slowly back to his seat.  Nels waits until his opponent is seated.  Then, rises. \nNELS Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for \nETTA Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments. \nNELS Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre? \nETTA A thousand. \nNELS So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500. \n", "test1_id": 1560, "test2_input": "NELS And the blood could not have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative. \nDR. WHITMAN That's obvious. \nNELS You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff.  Where a fella's hand goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...? \nAnd the witness stops.  A curious question.  But Nels is waiting. With an expectant smile. \nDR. WHITMAN Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be? \nNELS No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair? \nDR. WHITMAN None. \nNELS Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull... \nDR. WHITMAN I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t... \nNELS (gently persistent) ...would that seem logical? \nDR. WHITMAN I don't know. \nNELS You don't. \nNels lifts the gaff off the table.  Looks at it. \nNELS The coroner testified that Carl Heine had a cut.  A fresh cut. Probably one or two hours old. \nAnd grasps the butt end.  Of the gaff. \nNELS On the palm.  Of his right hand. \nWalks, dragging one leg just slightly, toward the box.  And holding the butt of the gaff toward him... \nNELS With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull... \nDR. WHITMAN I'm a hemotologist, not a detective. \nNELS ...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable? \nWhitman won't be badgered.  His smile carries only a trace of coldness... \nDR. WHITMAN It is not my function.  To weigh those probabilities. \nNels looks him over. \nNELS You're right. \nAnd turns his back.  Walks away. \nNELS ...that's the jury's job. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks in pin-stripe serge today.  Pommaded hair, glossy wing-tips. He is crisp. \nHOOKS Now this regiment you were training, the 442nd, this was all Nisei boys... \nFirst Sergeant VICTOR MAPLES wears his green dress uniform, splashed with decorations.  Thick and powerful, no neck, razor cut. The eyes are alive. \nMAPLES They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir. \nHOOKS And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat. \nMAPLES It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years. \nHOOKS So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager? \nMAPLES More than eager.  He was out to make a point. \nHooks finds that interesting.  Begins to pace. \nHOOKS And what point.  Was that. \nEXT. TRAINING FIELD, CAMP SHELBY, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nThe squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces, surround Sgt. Maples.  He paces before them, holding up a wooden staff, looking in their eyes... \nMAPLES Anyone. \nAnd Kabup steps forward.  Bows slightly.  Then salutes... \nKABUO SIR! \nMaples stares.  Hard. \nMAPLES You don't salute me, you don't call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an enlisted man. \nKabuo stares back.  Blank. \nMAPLES And nobody bows in this man's Army, you're in America, son. Not Japan. \nKABUO I'm sorry, sir, force of habit. \nMAPLES No more 'sir'.  That's the last of that. \nTosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet.  A little hard.  As Kabuo slips the helmet on... \nMAPLES The exercise is avoiding thrusts. Now, first y... \nKABUO (quietly) Ready, sergeant. \nCut off in mid-word, Maples glares back.  Are you?  THRUSTS sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more than an inch.  Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, Maples unleashes... \n...a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED, and Kabuo... \n...SLIPS them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move.  As a man might toy with a child.  Maples studies the face for any trace of mockery.  And sees nothing at all.  STABS out, only to have Kabuo... \n...SLASH Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to be nearly invisible.  Maples clearly STUNNED by the display. \nKABUO (quietly) Excuse me. \nHe bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him.  And bows. Slightly.  The sergeant is hot.  He looks into the faces of this Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk.  There is none. \n", "test2_true": "KABUO For combat.  Sergeant. \nAnd Maples LUNGES with surprising speed, to be SWEPT off his feet in a BLUR, lying FLAT on the earth, his head PINNED to the ground by the tip of Kabuo's staff. \nA hush.  Kabuo withdraws his staff.  Retrieves Maples'... \nKABUO (just above a whisper) Your weapon, sergeant. \nAnd bows. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nMaples smiling easily.  Like a guy telling the story in a bar. \nHOOKS Well, what then, sergeant? \nMAPLES What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow. \nEveryone laughs.  Maples the loudest.  Hooks smiles like a regular Joe. \nHOOKS And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle? \nMAPLES Oh, in a heartbeat. \nAnd the smiles are gone.  All around. \nMAPLES Able and willing.  Like few men I've ever seen. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nHooks sits against the prosecution table.  His demeanor gentle, respectful.  His voice soft. \nHOOKS So the plan was for your husband to fish through the prime season. Then, in November, sell the boat. And you would move onto the farm. \nIn the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity.  Blonde and alabaster and modest, in her black dress of mourning. \nSUSAN MARIE That was his plan, yes. \nIn the press row, the boys are attentive.  An angle they know they can sell.  Ishmael among them, watching with neutral eyes. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Whatever she said, she was Hooks' star witness.  The jury, especially the men, would not betray this fine lady with a not guilty verdict.  How could they face her? \nHooks walks slowly toward her.  As if she were a precious object, deserving of reverence. \nHOOKS Can you think back for me to the morning of September 8?  The day after your husband purchased the farm.  One week before his death. Can you recall that morning? \nSUSAN MARIE I can. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nA bright bathroom, filled with STEAM, filtering the sunlight.  PUSH toward the opaque shower door, TOWARD the sound of rushing water. And of breathing.  THROUGH it to... \n...Susan Marie and her husband.  Her arms are wound about his neck. Her legs wrapped around his body, feet locked behind the small of his back.  Carl holds her high with his strong hands, so he can lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow, slow thrusts.  Her wet blonde hair is pasted across her face, and her eyes are closed. The intensity holds us. \nINT. PARLOR - MORNING \nCLOSE on a paint brush.  It rests across the lid of a can of wood stain.  See now... \n...Susan Marie kneeling by the table she is refinishing.  But her hands, her body, are motionless.  Her eyes stare out the window... \n...across the yard.  Her towering husband walks beside a smaller man.  Carl is doing the talking.  Kabuo's face is stone. \nINT. PARLOR - LATER \nSusan Marie sits quietly in a rocker, nursing her baby.  Her hands tenderly stroke the feeding infant.  But her eyes are attentive. Concerned. \nCARL (O.S.) What could I tell him?  There's my mother to think about.  You know what she'd say? \nSusan Marie knows.  What Etta would say. \nCARL (O.S.) I said I'd think it over, talk with you. \nSUSAN MARIE Did he go away angry? \nSee Carl now, pacing his own parlor like a caged bear.  Agitated in a way we could not have expected. \nCARL He kept talkin' about those seven acres belonged to his father, and how honorable and decent his father was.  His meaning was pretty clear. And I didn't much like it. \nSUSAN MARIE You had a scrap. \nNursing her baby.  Calm, direct. \nCARL I couldn't...talk to him.  Look, Kabuo's a Jap.  And I don't hate Japs, but I don't like 'em neither. It's hard to explain if you weren't in the war, you know? \nSUSAN MARIE He's not a Jap.  You don't mean that.  You and he were friends. \nAnd Carl turns.  Looks at her.  A full beat. \nCARL We were kids. \nHe looks helpless.  Frustrated.  He doesn't want his anger to spill onto her. \nHe leaves the room.  Without a word.  HOLD on her. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nSusan Marie's cornflower eyes are set.  Wary. \nNELS (O.S.) So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h... \nSUSAN MARIE I wouldn't say encouraged. \nNELS (O.S.) Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed. \nSUSAN MARIE Not in those words. \nNELS (O.S.) So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been. \nShe thinks about this. \nSUSAN MARIE I guess so. \n", "test2_id": 1561, "test3_input": "Nels is nodding.  Nodding. \nNELS I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate. \nSUSAN MARIE Carl never lied. \nNELS Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude. \nAnd then.  As if it had just occurred to him... \nNELS Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you? \nSUSAN MARIE He had no reason to. \nNELS Carl ever say he got one? \nSUSAN MARIE I can't speak for him. \nNELS You can speak for what he said.

ISHMAEL'S DESOTO, CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT \nIshmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry fields of Center Valley. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) My father had bought the DeSoto fifteen years before.  Driving it reminded me of him.  Which I considered a neutral fact... \nHe turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for his convenience. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Actually, it was pleasant. \nFollowing the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Snow made all the fields into one. The notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no sense. \nUp ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) But I knew such things occurred. Having been to war and all. \nThe man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind them.  And gets out. \nHe crunches over to where Hisao works... \nISHMAEL May I give you folks a lift? \nHatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair from her eyes. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I didn't look at her.  I thought that would be best. \nHer eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side. Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face Ishmael... \nHATSUE My father is grateful for your kindness.  But he will free his car, shortly. \nIshmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel. \nISHMAEL Okay, I'll help. \nINT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT \nIshmael drives with Hisao beside him. \nISHMAEL I know it's caused you trouble. But don't you think the snow is beautiful, coming down? \nHis eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet hair pasted against her cheek. \nHISAO Yes, very beautiful. \nSuddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart away.  Hers hold. \nHATSUE This trial is unfair.  You should write about that in your newspaper. \nHe keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road. \nISHMAEL (calmly) What should I say? \nHATSUE Just that.  This trial is wrong, they are calling a good man a killer. It is only about prejudice, and that is unfair. \nHe thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him. \nISHMAEL We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t... \nHATSUE I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper. \nAnd his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror. \nISHMAEL Maybe I should write a column. What do you think? \nShe studies his face. \nHATSUE What do you think? \nNo smile.  On either side. \nISHMAEL I think people.  Should be fair. \n", "test3_true": "HATSUE Will you write that? \nHer voice is soft.  The difference is palpable. \nISHMAEL I might just. \nHis voice is kindness and friendship. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I was part of her life again.  I was a person. \nEXT. COAST GUARD LIGHTHOUSE, POINT WHITE - DUSK \nA tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it. \nINT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK \nIshmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the room at all the records.  Voila. \nISHMAEL You have the night watch?  On the radio. \nLEVANT Since September.  Last guys got transferred. \nIshmael looks around.  There is a lot of stuff. \nISHMAEL And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em. \nLEVANT Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space. \nIshmael nods.  Guess so. \nISHMAEL All kinds of radio transmissions? Fisherman in trouble, and such. \nInnocent question.  Random example. \nLEVANT All kinds.  Make yourself at home. \nAnd leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled as he is. \nINT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY \nIshmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the elbow.  He turns the corner to see... \n...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An infant carried at her shoulder. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I'd been back two months.  It was the first time I'd seen her. \nHe joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes. Meet his. \nHATSUE Hello. \nThe voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her. \nHATSUE I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor... \nISHMAEL The Japs did it. \nNo one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue never blinks. \nISHMAEL They shot it off.  At Tarawa. \nShe holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her shoulder. \nISHMAEL I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that. \nAll the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell her.  A murmur... \nISHMAEL I'm sorry about everything.  All of it. \nHe drops his milk and crackers on the counter. \nAnd walks away. \nINT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT \nIshmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open in his lap. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona, a Greek-owned freighter, was lost. In heavy fog. \nHis finger.  Traces a line of the report. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) They radioed to the lighthouse. They would have to dogleg, bisecting Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip Milholland wrote that down.  In his report. \nIshmael closes his eyes. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship Channel Bank.  And his watch stopped.  At 1:47. \nHe looks out through the glass.  As if he could watch it happen. \nISHMAEL (V.O.) A huge freighter plowing through. Throwing a wake big enough to fling any man overboard. \nAnd Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket. \nISHMAEL (calls out) Seaman...? \nAnd closes the file.  Slips it back into the cabinet.  Levant appears, vaguely irritated by the summons.  So Ishmael smiles. Sorry, nothing important. \nISHMAEL How long you have this detail? \nLEVANT Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16. \nIshmael's face.  Just to clarify... \nISHMAEL You mean, early morning the 16th? \nLEVANT No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland. \nOh.  Ishmael nods. \nLEVANT They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery. \n", "test3_id": 1562}

It's the next morning, we SEE One Two running. Mumbles and Handsome Bob pull up along side of him in their car. There is a moment of pause while they admire One Two running along side of them. 
MUMBLES Don't you get bored of that? I mean, your not really going anywhere. If you wanna run, why don't you run to the shops or do something useful? 
ONE TWO You could do with some of this yourself Mumbles, you're letting yourself go. (beat) Anyway, I'm busy, have you come to talk about anything important? 
MUMBLES It's all about the zone isn't it? (MORE)

MUMBLES (CONT'D) You boys and girls like to find funny places in your head where nothing can get you, don't you? You're scared, you're running away from yourself One Two. 
ONE TWO No Mumbles, I am trying to run away from you. Bob, you sorted out the car?

HANDSOME BOB Yeah, it looks like a heap of shit, but it can't half go. (beat) A bit like you One Two. 
Mumbles turns to Handsome Bob 
MUMBLES I reckon he's trying to get fit for the lady. Nothing gets under his skin like a lady he can't have, does it? (pause) A straight going, cocky, educated, arrogant posh bird trips him right up. I reckon we should set Handsome Bob on her. That'll liven you up One Two. 
ONE TWO Bob wouldn't know where to begin. 
HANDSOME BOB I'm good with the posh ones, don't you worry about that. 
ONE TWO I've had enough of this, can you two piss off cos I am trying to find my "zone" 
One Two sprints off leaving them behind. 
MUMBLES He can't half run for a white fella. 
29   INT. LENNY'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT                                29 
Lenny is pacing in a ladies dressing gown with long silk socks. He can't sleep, he pours a large one, lights a cigar, picks up the phone and dials. 
LENNY COLE Archy? You awake? (beat) Never mind, you are now. I had a horrible dream that the Councilor didn't come through, I don't want anything going wrong on this one, that Russian's the key to the big time. (pause) You think he's all right? (MORE) (CONTINUED)

LENNY COLE (CONT'D) (beat) You sure? (beat) What did Jackie say? 
His feet go back up on the desk with confidence. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) She did? I knew he'd like the lighter, nice touch eh? She's a good girl that Jackie. (laughing) Give her another drink. (beat) You're right, he wouldn't have leant me his lucky painting if he didn't mean business. Yeah, I had it taken off it's easel and stuck it above my desk, it's looks magnifi.... 
He suddenly stops. His eyes have spotted something scary, the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the phone, the lamp, and the ash tray with him to the floor. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) (from the floor) Arch! Arch! I have been robbed. 
He turns the receiver the right way round. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) I said I have been robbed. (beat) I don't know when. The painting,.. it's gone. 
He stands fumbling and screaming, his scotch all over him. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) The one Uri gave me! (beat) All right LOANED for fucks sake! 
Beat while panic sets in and Archy is saying something on the other end. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) This isn't good Arch, it's his favorite painting, his lucky painting! Get round here and bring the troops.

Lenny's still pacing, a small gathering of tired looking HOOLIGANS are lined up in Lenny's office. 
BANDY Where was it Len? 
Lenny is standing in front of the fire place smoking and looking very anxious.

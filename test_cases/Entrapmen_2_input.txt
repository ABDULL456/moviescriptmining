MAC You mean.  Not as old as I look. 
She traces her finger along his cheek. 
GIN (a whisper) Yeh. 
And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back... 
...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the larger piece. 
GIN Do I deserve a reward? 
No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows. 
GIN It's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore.  I'm probably out of practice. 
But he just looks at her. 
MAC What's hard to find.  Is someone you truly want to be with. 
And leans closer.  Just above a whisper... 
MAC Even for awhile. 
He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for something to say. 
GIN It's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine. 
She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not forgetting that she's changed the subject. 
GIN Otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow. 
MAC Would that make it more stolen? 
She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe she's wondering if she actually likes him. 
GIN They even got my prescriptions. 
MAC Something you need? There are all-night chemists... 
He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose. 
GIN I take Prilosec.  For stomach acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma. 
She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease. 
GIN But since I didn't have to work all that hard tonight... 
He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger. 
GIN (softly) Ouch.  I had that coming. 
She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close. 
GIN Why would someone steal my luggage? Every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer. 
MAC Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there. 
Something in the tone. 
GIN Such as... 
MAC Well.  Wannabe dealers make excellent fences. 
A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the humor. 
GIN He thought I had a stolen painting.  In my bag. 
MAC I'm joking, of course. 
Kisses the top of her head. 
MAC The Vermeer wouldn't fit. 
Her eyes widen.  Just a little. 
GIN Excuse me? 
MAC Why, did you do something wrong? 
She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each reading the other's eyes. 
GIN You said.  Vermeer. 
MAC The most famous painting stolen this week. 
His turn.  To kiss her nose. 
MAC If you don't keep up on your craft.  You'll miss all the jokes. 
And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but... 
...he fills it with his own. 
This conversation.  Is over. 
INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING 
VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see... 
Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...

The female Mexican staff, some crying, shred medical files as out the door a child is dragged away by A REAVER... 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) They started putting the children to sleep. Like dogs. 
We hear Gabriela telling them (in Spanish) that "we cannot let them do this". Some of the staff meet her eyes. 
NEW SHOT-- GABRIELA IN A SUPPLY CLOSET, DOOR CRACKED... 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) (HUSHED) We are going to save as many as we can. I have read about a place in the north. A place for mutants. They call it Eden. 
SOME FLASHES OF IMAGES OF AN ESCAPE. AN ALARM SOUNDING. PANIC. SECURITY. FEDERALES COMING TO THE LAB. RUNNING. CRYING CHILDREN. Exhortations to the kids to keep running. GUNFIRE. 
LOGAN REACTS TO THE CHAOS. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   49. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) I have not shown anyone what you have now seen. Not until I am sure Laura is safe. 
AND NOW ON THE PHONE -- AN IMAGE OF GABRIELA LOPEZ IN THE MOTEL ROOM, BARELY ABLE TO KEEP HER HEAD UP... 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) If you are watching this, it means I am dead. I am not sure if any other children survived. We were separated. I am sorry, but there is no more money. That was a lie. You have everything I have in my life. 
Logan reacts to this. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) She is not my child... but I love her. You may not love her but she is your child. I see now you are not a hero. You are not what I read about. Maybe you never were. But please, I beg you, please bring her to safety. 
The recording ends. Logan tosses the phone down. 
He reaches up for the mirror, adjusts it so he can see-- 
Laura. Lying there, in a ball, sleeping, a plastic horse doll in her hands. Some comic books under her head. Suddenly, she awakes, her eyes meeting his. And holding. 
Logan blinks under the weight of her gaze. Then she looks away and rolls over. 
INT./ EXT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OKLAHOMA CITY -- NIGHT 
Laura awakes on the leatherette bench and looks up to Charles, sleeping soundly, holding her hand. Colored light passes over his face. She turns to see lights playing outside her window. She sits up to face-- 
THE SPECTACLE OF A MODERN GAMBLING STRIP. Dancing lights and thematic facades throb like fireworks. A car passes, blasting thumping hip hop. 
Charles blinks awake. We see in his eyes a quiet panic as he looks out at his surroundings and, for a moment, seems to have no idea how he got here nor who these people are. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 50. 
Laura meets his eyes. It starts to come back to him. He looks out the window as they pull into a Casino parking area. 
CHARLES ...Is this where we're hiding out? 
LOGAN We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple hours sleep, clean up, get new clothes, ditch the limo, get a new ride and get the fuck out. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - NIGHT 
Logan pulls to a stop a valet who eagerly approaches until he sees the thrashed condition of their ride and its frazzled passengers. Logan hands him cash. 
LOGAN Keep it out front. 
Laura steps out, clinging to her horse. Dazzled by the throbbing lights and sexy throbbing musak. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT 
Weary, Logan holds an electronic key in his hand as the threesome moves past slots and gambling tables still operating in the middle of the night. Laura is overwhelmed by noise, lights and activity. She jumps WHEN A LOUD BELL RINGS as someone wins a jackpot. Charles puts a hand on her. 
Logan hits the UP button of the elevator and, as they wait for the doors to open, they all looks at-- 
A DISPLAY FOR A CASINO CLOTHING STORE. A male mannequin in handsome western wear stands beside a shapely Cowgirl and a little kid mannequin in a unicorn tee/skirt and studded denim jacket. Charles eyes a suit and hat on a mannequin in an easy chair with a pipe. 
Bing! -- the elevator doors open. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
They enter, Logan pushing Charles who carries shopping bags in his lap and tries on a new hat, tag attached. As the doors close, Logan presses their floor, the button lights and Laura starts to press other floors. Logan swats her hand. 
Meanwhile, Charles digs in the bag, offers Logan a new baseball hat with a tag on it, tissue paper falling. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   51. 
LOGAN Please wait till we're in the room. 
The doors suddenly re-open and there are A COUPLE (dressed nicely) and awkwardness as Logan hits the door close button. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Sorry. Going up. 
Laura starts hitting other buttons again. He swats her again. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - SUITE - DAWN 
Oklahoma City lies beyond the big windows, morning light filling this well appointed suite. We see the remains of a room service breakfast. Clothing wrappers and boxes are scattered about. In a robe, Laura helps Charles finish donning his new outfit. Suddenly, there are gunshots from the TV. Laura turns. 
ON SCREEN -- A shootout in a 50's technicolor Western. Elisha Cook Jr is gunned down in the mud by Jack Palance. 
CHARLES This film is a classic, Laura. Almost a hundred years old now. I first saw it at the Esoldo in Dewsbury when I was your age. 
ONSCREEN -- Now, it's a cemetery scene where the homesteaders sing a hymnal as they lower Elisha Cook Jr. to the ground. 
INT. HOTEL - SUITE - BATHROOM - SAME 
A line of mini bar bottles stacked on the sink, Logan dresses in front of the mirror. Exhaustion catching up with him, his body still scarred from the battle at the smelting plant. He finished buttoning a new shirt. Picks up his hat. 
His eyes land upon Laura's bloody clothes on the floor. Her backpack nearby. Logan opens the backpack, pulls out those files he'd seen before. TRANSIGEN and ALKALI stamped on them. 
He flips through them -- records for the young mutants (some we saw on Gabriela's videos), we glimpse details: 
X23-44: Projects himself into other people via ocular lock.

JAY Yeah, I just wanted to show you this so I could say-- 
(SEEING HIM) Who the hell are YOU??? Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD I'm agent Kay. 
JAY You new around here? 
" KAY" 
(LAUGHS) Good one, partner. 
JAY Yeah, okay, but I need the other Kay. You know, craggy old white guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old white guy. I got you something. He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug -- 
"KAY" (CONT'D) Have I told you today how much I appreciate working together? 
JAY What the HELL is going on here? Why are you pretending to be Kay? 
" KAY FR You seem upset. Let's go get some coffee and talk about our feelings. 
JAY How about instead, you go find me THIS guy? Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words: 
KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969 
Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW 
WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION 
JAY (CONT'D) Killed? In 1969? Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last night -- but now everything is different. We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT 
KAY, DEAD AT SCENE... Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading... Snatches of the typewritten incident report The casualty report 
ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE... A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION. Jay stares, struck by this -- 
JAY (CONT'D) Kay's dead? How? Why? The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm! 
COMPUTER (V.0.) Attention. Inbound missiles entering solar system! Inbound missiles entering solar system! Zed enters, chuckling at the warning: 
ZED Well, must be a Tuesday. Okay, computer [twins]. Give me a trajectory and an ETA on those puppies. 
COMPUTER (V.0.) Running impact simulator... Everyone watches as we see an animated simulation: the missiles smash into EARTH... 
COMPUTER (V.0.) (CONT'D) Catastrophic Earth impact imminent. 
ZED Damn. Welp, looks like we're all done for. Sorry, kid, it's been a good ride. 
A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES Jay remains calm: 
JAY Whoa, what's everyone freaking out about? We had one of these last week. "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping. 
"KAY" We're all gonna die! 
JAY Wait - what is everyone's problem? What about that pan-galactic missile shield thing? 
ZED Sure, great idea, if we had one.

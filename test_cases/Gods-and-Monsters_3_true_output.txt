CLAY I just want to watch it, okay? 
On the tv, the blind man thanks God for sending him a friend. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Hanna's frown pops open. 
HANNA He is not going to kill the old man? 
WHALE No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black. 
In a crypt, the Monster meets Dr. Pretorius, who is having a midnight snack on top of a closed coffin.  "Friend?" the monster asks.  "Yes, I hope so," answers Pretorius, without batting an eyelash.  He offers the Monster a drink, then adds: "Have a cigar.  They're my only weakness." 
WHALE The cigars were my own brand.  So that I could have the leftovers. 
On the tv, the Monster groans:  "Love dead.  Hate living." Whale's focus sharpens, prompted by the unexpected discussion of death. 
INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT 
The Monster holds a skull in both hands and happily growls, "Wiiife."  Betty, shudders, for real this time. 
HARRY Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were. 
CLAY The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that? 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Dr. Frankenstein and Pretorius make their final preparations.  Frankenstein inquires where the fresh heart came from.  "There are always accidental deaths occurring," Pretorius replies.  "Always."  Once again, Whale responds to the talk of death. 
INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT 
Finally, the Bride comes to life.  She looks up, down, left, right, uncertain who she is.  The Monster stares tenderly.  "Friend?"  He timidly touches her arm and she screams. 
BETTY All right!  You don't want him. 
The Monster is heartbroken.  Nobody loves him, not even his Bride. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The Bride shrieks again. 
HANNA She is horrible. 
WHALE She is beautiful. 
The Monster's pain turns to anger.  He tears through the lab, orders Frankenstein to escape with his wife.  But he wants Pretorius and the Bride to stay.  "We belong dead." Whale reacts sharply to the line. 
The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends. Hanna shivers as she stands. 
HANNA Ugh.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy, but your movie is not my teacup. Still, I am glad there is a happy ending.  The bad people are dead and the good people live. 
She hits the button on the Magnavox with the flat of her palm. 
INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT 
Betty turns off the Motorola. 
BETTY Weird movie.  Weird, weird, weird. 
Harry stands up and stretches.  Clay remains seated. 
CLAY So what did you think? 
BETTY Weird. 
DWIGHT I loved it.  I want a switch like that in my trailer, so I can blow us to kingdom come when things don't go my way. 
He wobbles when he climbs off his stool. 
DWIGHT Damn but it's getting drunk in here.  Late too.  The bride of Dwight is going to bite my head off. 
He tilts toward the door. 
DWIGHT You coming, Boone? 
CLAY I think I'll hang around. 
HARRY Go home, Clay.  We're closing up. 
CLAY I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open. 
He waits to see how Betty reacts.  She shrugs.  Harry takes his book and cash drawer to the back door.

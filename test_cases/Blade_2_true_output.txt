as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her. 
As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister! 
She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into Vanessa's face -- 
Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for Blade's sword -- 
BACK TO FROST AND BLADE 
Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask of insanity. 
FROST I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race. 
KAREN (O.S.) Get away from him! 
Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He gasps, chokes in air -- 
Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform. Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline powder. 
KAREN Blade! 
Karen flings the sword at Blade. 
THE SWORD 
spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt. 
Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost retreats, uncertain now. 
BLADE Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. 
FROST You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then. 
BLADE You don't have a few minutes, Frost. 
Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield! 
Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's poisonous mace. Piteous, really. 
Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit. 
FROST (laughing cruelly) Just as I thought. Still chained to your mother's breast after all these years. 
In the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic, youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo. 
FROST (gloating) You're too human, Blade. 
BLADE (steeling himself) It's because I'm human that I can do this. 
Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for -- 
Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind them, SHATTERING and -- 
Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD. 
Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over him -- 
EXT. BANK OF EREBUS - CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Every door and window of the bank is BLOWN OUTWARD from the force of the EXPLOSION. While along the street, manhole covers flip from their moorings, spinning up into the air like dimes, being buoyed by geysers of blood. 
INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
Silence, just the steady DRIP-DRIP of liquid draining. The underworld temple gleams with a crimson sheen now. 
ON BLADE 
as he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force of the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet, retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet -- 
THE SWORDBLADE 
lies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket -- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops to pick it up. 
KAREN (O.S.) Blade? 
Blade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?

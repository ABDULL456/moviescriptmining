EARL (CONT'D) Sorry about the mess.

JENNIFER (CONT'D) (Jennifer holds a piece of paper) .on Mockingbird Trail. 
Earl's surprised. 
EARL Oh, you're Miss Hills. 
Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small drawer and takes out a key. 
EARL (CONT'D) Don't suppose you know how to get out there? 
JENNIFER Afraid not. 
Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn arrows already on it. 
EARL Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit tricky. 
(BEAT) These here arrows will get you through town. Over here, it's more dirt road and woods so it can get kind of dicey. We're a tad short on street signs. 
JENNIFER Well if I get lost I'll just ask for directions. 
EARL To who? Lady, the cabin is a real beaut, but heck if there ain't nothin' out there for a good country mile. 
JENNIFER 
(JOKING) Well, I guess I don't have to worry about bothering the neighbors. 
EARL Not planning on throwing a party, are ya? The security deposit... 
JENNIFER No, no. I'm looking forward to the peace and quiet. I'm a novelist. I'm starting my next book. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4. Earl just looks at her. 
EARL Alright, well, if that's what you're aimin' for, just follow that there map. 
Jennifer looks at the map. 
5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5 
Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map. Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump. 
EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 
Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own. 
Jennifer spins around. 
Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.

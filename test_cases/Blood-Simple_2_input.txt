Ray shakes his head, smiling. Abby squints at him, looking for help. 
ABBY ...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found-- 
RAY With your gun?... 
He puts the knife in his pocket and walks over to the door. As he approaches her: 
RAY ...Nobody broke in, Abby. I'll tell you the truth... 
Ray faces Abby in front of the door. 
RAY ...Truth is, I've felt sick the last couple of days. Can't eat... Can't sleep... When I try to I... Abby... 
It's difficult to bring out. Ray's hand gropes for the cross- slat on the screen door. Finally: 
RAY ...The truth is... he was alive when I buried him. 
Abby stares. 
An object materializes in the sky beyond them. It is flipping end-over-end in slow motion, moving toward Abby and Ray and the screen door. Abby and Ray, each staring at the other, fail to notice until-- 
THWACK--it bounces off the screen. 
Abby starts; Ray doesn't. 
The spell is broken, Abby pushes hesitantly at the screen door. Ray's hand slides off the cross-slat; he makes no move to stop her. 
CLOSE SHOT  THE FRONT STOOP 
As Abby steps over the rolled-up newspaper that hit the screen door. 
TRACKING SHOT  ON ABBY 
Hurrying down the driveway to get to her car. A low rumble is building on the soundtrack. Abby glances at Ray's car as she passes it. 
ABBY'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD  THE CAR 
More blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering the back seat. The bass rumble grows louder, punctuated by a rhythmic thumping. 
EXT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT  DAY 
OVER ABBY'S SHOULDER 
As she pounds frantically on the door--the sound continuing over the cut. After a moment the door edges open. 
Meurice is standing in the doorway in a long bathrobe. A sleeper's blindfold is pushed up over his forehead. 
MEURICE Abby. What's the matter? 
ABBY I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in? 
He looks at her hard. 
MEURICE Yeah... yeah, come in... 
He steps aside to let her pass. 
MEURICE ...but I gotta tell ya... 
INT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT 
As Abby enters. 
MEURICE ...I'm retired. 
Meurice switches on a table lamp; the curtains are drawn against the sun. Abby follows Meurice over to the bar. 
MEURICE Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink? 
ABBY No, I-- 
MEURICE Well I do... 
He pours himself a drink. 
MEURICE ...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired. 
ABBY Something happened with Marty and Ray-- 
MEURICE (sharply) Abby... 
He glares at her. 
MEURICE ...Let me ask you one question...

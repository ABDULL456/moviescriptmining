Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer beeps. 
"confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471" 
Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A graphic appears: 
"Connection is terminated/ Status idle" 
Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast. 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, he sets the book down and takes up Iron John. 
INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING 
At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing crowd. 
LARDNER You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man. 
MCCULLERS Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though. 
LARDNER Lisbon? 
MCCULLERS In Portugal, yes. 
In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave. 
LARDNER Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? 
MCCULLERS In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. 
Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this. 
LARDNER You always say that. You always have to know everybody. Why don't I just take the weekend off and let you kill him. Since you two are so close. 
They exit. 
EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING 
INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR 
Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news. 
BROADCAST (V.O.) ...with highs today in the upper seventies. Related stocks on Wall Street today as scandal continues to rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech Center... 
MARTIN'S CAR 
blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid- eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied by two figures. 
INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE 
are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast. 
BROADCAST (V.O.) ...An unknown "whistle-blower" has leaked a number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next year's models to authorities that could cost millions in recalls.... 
MARTIN 
flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes fascistically. 
MARTIN Mein hero. 
...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash. 
EXT. HIGHWAY- 
Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. Dig it... 
INT. MARTIN'S CAR 
Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar voice....

has tears forming in his eyes.  A smile turns up the corners of his mouth, and quickly lights up his whole face. 
LARDNER (softly, to Eldridge) Are you saying that he's... 
ELDRIDGE (smiling broadly) Shhhhhh. 
Harry takes Pete in his arms and hugs him tightly, burying his face in Pete's shoulder and sobbing. 
HARRY I knew all along.  I knew you were alive!  Oh, Luke... 
Pete doesn't quite know what to think.  He clearly has no idea who this old man is. 
LARDNER (mouth agape in disbelief) Mother o'god... 
ELDRIDGE (to Pete) Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father! 
Pete looks at Harry.  It's not so much that he remembers anything -- he's swept up in the moment. 
PETE My father...? 
Pete wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly, glancing over at 
ELDRIDGE AND LARDNER 
who look on goofily, fighting back tears.  They smile at Pete, who smiles back tentatively. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Harry, Pete, Eldridge and Lardner come outside. 
ELDRIDGE C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou. 
PETE The Bijou? 
LARDNER That's where you live. 
PETE We live in a theater? 
HARRY Only one in town. (he opens the car door for Pete) Get in, son. 
ELDRIDGE (sotto, to Lardner) Ben, when's Delly due back? 
LARDNER (sotto) Tomorrow afternoon... (seized by a thought) ... oh my god... 
ELDRIDGE (sotto) Exactly.  Break it to her gently. 
Eldridge and Harry get in the car.  Lardner comes over to Pete's back seat window. 
LARDNER Get plenty of rest, Luke.  You took a pretty big wallop there. 
He turns to move away, then turns back. 
LARDNER Good to have you back. 
Eldridge starts the car and they drive away. 
(NOTE: Henceforth, "PETE" will be known as "LUKE."  It'll be easier to keep track of things, since everyone's now calling him Luke, anyway.  Trust me.) 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ELDRIDGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY 
Harry sits next to the Sheriff, and Luke has the back seat all to himself.  He leans forward toward the front seat and taps Harry on the shoulder. 
LUKE Excuse me... what's your, um, your name? 
HARRY Harry, son.  Harry. 
LUKE And... what's my name again? 
HARRY Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby. 
LUKE Ah. (taking it for a spin) Luke.  Luke.  I like it. 
Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street. 
HIS POV 
Shops are open for business, TOWNSPEOPLE are going about their lives.  A few stop and watch as the Sheriff's car goes by. 
LUKE How long have I been gone? 
Eldridge looks at Harry, who stares ahead. 
LUKE How long? 
Pause.  The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. He turns around in his seat and faces Luke. 
HARRY (gently) You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead. 
LUKE When did I leave? 
HARRY You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two. 
Luke sits back against the back seat and lets this sink in.

CAROL (big smile, she wants the moment to be an upper) Hello, Doc. 
He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at Carol. 
CAROL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
Doc is silent. 
CAROL (CONT'D) It's been raining a lot the last few days. 
Doc is silent. 
CAROL (CONT'D) We'll try again. 
DOC No way. I've got to get out now.

TOM You've got a major hair growth going on. 
CHARLIE Shut up. 
TOM I'm serious. You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker. 
Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom. 
CHARLIE Here. 
TOM You're offering me one of your donuts? I don't know what to say. I'm getting all misty. 
CHARLIE If it'll shut your mouth you can have the whole bag. 
Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses the bag back. 
TOM Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll never get out of this truck. 
CHARLIE (disgusted) I love how you think you're better than this. 
TOM Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's a lot to like about this job -- and I don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income. 
CHARLIE (angry) You ungrateful shit! I don't believe you! 
TOM (surprised) Charlie, relax! I was kidding! 
CHARLIE You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go back to selling hot construction machinery. That's a helluva career. 
TOM It had better hours. 
Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat. 
CHARLIE You think this is a joke? This is funny? Jesus Christ! You know how lucky you are you could get in here? Thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught? 
TOM (angry) That wasn't luck, old man. That was skill. I was good at it. 
CHARLIE Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to fence bulldozers. That's goddamn genius time. 
TOM About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts. 
CHARLIE Oh, so that's all I've been doing, huh? Just wasting my life away. 
TOM I didn't say that. 
CHARLIE Yeah, building a home, raising a family -- that's just stupid. 
TOM I didn't say that! 
CHARLIE You know what, Tom? I really don't give a shit what you said. 
Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that about? 
EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - ESTABLISHING - DUSK 
INT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK ECU PEN ON PAPER 
Writing letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is... 
JIM 
Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are... 
RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR 
Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school teacher. 
ON TV 
Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the flood. 
RAY "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters shall rise up out of the north and be an overflowing flood and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl." Jeremiah 47:2. 
Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto. 
KENNY You're gonna be able to buy a helluva lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First thing I'm gonna do is get my brother a lawyer. Best that money can buy. 
A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk. 
RAY What's he facing? 
KENNY Thirty in. 
RAY He cap a cop or something...? 
KENNY Security guard. "In the commission..." All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. Now I'm gonna be able to afford him a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut. 
Jim leans over to Kenny. 
JIM 'Scuse me a second. Take a look at thirty-one across. 
Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny. 
KENNY Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword puzzles. 
MR. MEHLOR I'll take a look, Jim. 
JIM Kenny can read. (to Kenny) Just look at it. You know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, but it doesn't look right? 
Jim points at the newspaper. 
JIM Thirty-one across. 
Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper. 
KENNY (mumbles as he reads) Mention money again and... 
His eyes go wide.

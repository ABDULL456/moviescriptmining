You know how she loves to ski. \nELDERLY MAN No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains. \nSelena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette. \nSELENA Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. \nNIGEL It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me. \nSELENA I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. \nNIGEL You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months. \nSelena smirks at him, self-confidently. \nSELENA I just did. Because I have the Power. \nNIGEL You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. \nNigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case. \nSELENA Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far. \nNIGEL Cigarette? \nHe holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection. \nINSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS. \nBACK TO SCENE. \nQuick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared. \nNIGEL Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit. \nNigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently. \nSELENA Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. \nNIGEL You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate. \nSELENA I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber. \nNigel locks eyes with her. \nNIGEL Make me. \nHe takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass. \nNigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him. \nNIGEL Balefire on you, Selena! \nSELENA (grinning) You Scorpios can never take a joke. \nAll quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. \nNIGEL You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning. \nSELENA Throw him out. \nTwo burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking. \nNIGEL You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie! \nThe crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. \nBianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent. BIANCA Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the Circle: Selena! \nApplause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture. \nSELENA Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader. \n", "test1_true": "SELENA And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the coming year... \nA woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames. \nPanic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house. \nINT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM \nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil. \nSelena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns. \nThe Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly. \nELDERLY MAN Is this Nigel's doing? \nSELENA It's a warning, that's for sure. \nELDERLY MAN Maybe it was just an accident. \nSELENA (mysteriously) There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs. \nThe elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor. \nELDERLY MAN Then what does it mean??? \nSelena shrugs and puts aside her cards. \nSELENA Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit. \nEXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY \nA bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase. \nIn front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building. \nINT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY \nLinda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall. \nMYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice. \nMYRA Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days. \nLinda walks on up to the next f1oor. \nINT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL \nLinda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters. \nINT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE \nMR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her. \nMR. DANVERS Don't you believe in knocking? \nLINDA Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot. \nShe knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would. \nMR. DANVERS What can I do for you? \nLINDA I'm Linda Lee. \nMy cousin wrote you. \nMR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded. \nMR . DANVERS Cousin? Wrote me? \nLinda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk. \nTwo beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes. \nLINDA The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent. \nMR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it. \n", "test1_id": 1464, "test2_input": "SELENA I'm ready for her. I'll show you. \nSelena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan. \nEXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY \nMR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan. \nSELENA Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one. \nSelena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool. \nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL \nThe empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN Why the empty cage? \nSELENA That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. \nSelena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees. \nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL \nBehind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSelena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight. \nETHAN What...? \nSELENA You don't get this far without paying...a certain price. \nShe turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan. \nMR. DANVERS If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her. \nMRS . DANVERS I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you. \nShe stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her. \nJIMMY (shyly) I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens. \nLUCY Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention. \nJIMMY You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time? \nLUCY You bet your ass. \nJIMMY Why didn't you tell me? \nLUCY You're supposed to guess. \nShe reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers. \nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX \nZaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses. \nSUPERGIRL Why are you stopping? \nZALTAR Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do. \nHe continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand. \nZALTAR Oh dear! \nThe vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards. \nZALTAR The wand. Use it. \nSupergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion. \nZALTAR Good girl! That's the way! \n", "test2_true": "ZALTAR You can use the wand. \nSUPERGIRL Better than when I was a child. \nShe hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress. \nZALTAR I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like your mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM \nSelena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out. \nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX \nFlaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress. \nZALTAR What's that? Never saw anything like that. \nSUPERGIRL Don't stop. Keep moving. \nZALTAR Yes, mustn't stop. \nSUPERGIRL (grimly) It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work. \nAnother flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex. \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar. Use the wand! \nZALTAR Too late. Too late. Save yourself. \nHe is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears. \nZALTAR (voice over) Goodbye... \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar! \nShe begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex. \nSUPERGIRL You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you. \nSuddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster. \nEXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND \nSupergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her. \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart. \nShe looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her. \nSUPERGIRL Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you. \nShe stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet. \nEXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN \nSupergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nSupergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror. \nSUPERGIRL You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. \nETHAN She has hostages. \nSELENA The Danvers. And two of your little friends. \nSUPERGIRL It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for. \nEthan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck. \nINSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY. \nBACK TO SCENE \n", "test2_id": 1465, "test3_input": "Supergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors. \nINT. CONSERVATORY \nJimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns. \nJIMMY Hey, what gives? \nThe blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nSelena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme. \nSELENA All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till the last card's dealt. \nSelena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins. \nAll the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way. \nSUPERGIRL You've run out of things to throw, Selena. SELENA Not yet. \nSelena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack. \nETHAN It's her shadow-self! Her dark side! \nSUPERGIRL How do I fight it? \nETHAN Turn it against her. \nSupergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds. \nThere are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious. \nREAL SELENA Power of Shadow, kill her!! \nThe Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice. \nSECOND SELENA No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me. \nREAL SELENA Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying. \nSECOND SELENA You are my shadow, you must obey me. \nThe Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow. \nEthan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock. \nETHAN I've got it! The Power Source! \nThe Real Se1ena cries out with despair. \nAnd then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her. \nREAL SELENA (terrified) No! Stop! Please! \nEthan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. \nSECOND SELENA Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City. \nETHAN It is you, then, really? \nWithout a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips. \nSECOND SELENA Well? \nETHAN It's you all right. \nSECOND SELENA I'll make it easy for you. \nShe again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand. \nETHAN I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me. \nSUPERGIRL I never doubted you for a moment. \nREAL SELENA Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying... \n", "test3_true": "The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan. \nSELENA I'm free. I can never thank you enough. \nSUPERGIRL For what? \nSelena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds. \nSELENA Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time. \nSUPERGIRL Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused. (to Ethan) You could come too. It might be safer for you. \nETHAN No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs. \nSUPERGIRL I'll come back as soon as I can. \nSELENA What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around here. \nSupergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen. \nETHAN She's right. They'll string her up. \nSUPERGIRL Do you want to come to Argo City? \nSELENA What's it like? \nSUPERGIRL It's the most beautiful place in the universe. \nSELENA Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go. \nSupergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena. \nSUPERGIRL Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the journey through inner space. \nSelena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRISON. DAY \nSupergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION. \nThe prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing. \nEXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY \nAll the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA. \nSUNSET \nSelena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun. \nSELENA Where is inner space? \nSUPERGIRL It's everywhere. But water is always the door. \nThey plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface. \nEXT. INNER SPACE \nSupergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder. \nSELENA Will they be angry with me for stealing the Power Source? \nSUPERGIRL They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead. \nSELENA Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel. \nSUPERGIRL That's home. \nP.O.V.

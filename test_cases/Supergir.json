{"train": "Revised Screenplay 17th January, 1983. \nALEXANDER SALKIND presents SUPERGIRL \nby \nDavid Odell \nCopyright 1983 CANTHARUS PRODUCTIONS N.V. All Rights Reserved \nEXT. SPACE \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . \nINT. ARGO CITY \nAND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes. \nTHE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model. \nTEACHER And now, who can give me the electron wave functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding? \nThe five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one. \nCHILD The cube root of the wavelength over the natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared. \nThe teacher smiles. \nTEACHER Well, maybe that was a bit too easy... \nTHE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. . \nA small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven. \nBehind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside. \nKARA What are you making: \nZALTAR It's going to be a tree, I think. \nKARA What's a tree? \nZALTAR It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went. \nKARA Where is Earth? \nZALTAR Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school? \nKARA Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head. \nZaltar laughs. \nZALTAR Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space. \nKARA I don't understand. \nZALTAR Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. \nZaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand. \nZALTAR. This is one of the four Power Sources of the City. I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I can do with it. \nZaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks. \nZALTAR You see, a tree is a living thing. \nKARA Can you create life? \nZALTAR No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays over the surface. . . \nA woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Kara. Kara. \nKara calls out in reply. \nKARA I'm here, mother. \nShe hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg. \nGEORGE Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you. \nSELENA Why George, are you proposing? \nGEORGE Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but... \nSELENA George---I thought you'd never ask. \nA shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake. \nGEORGE What the heck is that? \nThey look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth. \nSELENA A squirrel Frisbee? \nSelena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter. \nSelena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe. \nSELENA That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before. \nShe stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck. \nGEORGE Hey, where you going? \nSELENA (calling over her shoulder) I've got things to do. \nGEORGE What about my proposal? \nSELENA (dismissively) Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. \nShe gets in the pickup and. drives away. \nGEORGE Hey! My truck! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nKARA' S FACE \nShe is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen. \nALURA (voice over) But Kara, you are too young to go. \nANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED \nThey are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her. \nKARA I am almost an adult. This is what I want. \nZOR-EL But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous. \nKARA It was my fault we lost the Power Source. \nZOR-EL Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it. \nKARA I allowed it to escape the City. \nALURA Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was visit this place. \nKARA Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless someone brings it back. \nZOR-EL Superman will return it. \nKARA Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl- \nKARA I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now. \nZor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl. \nALURA What do your teachers think? \nZor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks. \nTEACHER It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's fighting for, Zor-El. \nSELENA What do you want? \nELDERLY MAN Western Europe. \nSELENA I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski. \nELDERLY MAN No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains. \nSelena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette. \nSELENA Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world. \nNIGEL It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me. \nSELENA I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places. \nNIGEL You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months. \nSelena smirks at him, self-confidently. \nSELENA I just did. Because I have the Power. \nNIGEL You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. \nNigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case. \nSELENA Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far. \nNIGEL Cigarette? \nHe holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection. \nINSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS. \nBACK TO SCENE. \nQuick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared. \nNIGEL Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit. \nNigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently. \nSELENA Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head. \nNIGEL You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate. \nSELENA I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber. \nNigel locks eyes with her. \nNIGEL Make me. \nHe takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass. \nNigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him. \nNIGEL Balefire on you, Selena! \nSELENA (grinning) You Scorpios can never take a joke. \nAll quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. \nNIGEL You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning. \nSELENA Throw him out. \nTwo burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking. \nNIGEL You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie! \nThe crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. \nBianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent. BIANCA Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the Circle: Selena! \nApplause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture. \nSELENA Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader. \nLINDA I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. \nMR. DANVERS Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. \nHe rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMPUS. DORM \nMR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus. \nMR DANVERS ...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. I think we'll put you in \"G\" dorm. \nHe opens the door and ushers her into the dorm. \nINT. DORM. CORRIDOR \nMR. Danvers leads Linda down the corridor. \nA girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal. \nSTUDENT MONITOR Man on the floor! \nImmediately, several of the room doors along the corridor slam shut. MR. Danvers smiles indulgently and leads Linda along to one of the rooms with an open door. \nINT. DORM ROOM \nLUCY LANE, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a Swiss Army Knife held over a wastebasket. MR. Danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of Earth. Lucy looks up. \nLUCY Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it. \nMR. DANVERS Lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia? \nLUCY It wasn't anorexia. It was the food. \nMR DANVERS Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads her into the room chattering away excitedly. \nLUCY Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness... \nMR. Danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted. \nLucy puts Linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack. \nLINDA I can do that. \nLUCY No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving? \nShe looks down at the nearly empty suitcase. LINDA There isn't any. \nLUCY This is all your clothes? \nLucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. Lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. Also a large painted poster of SUPERMAN. \nLINDA I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since... \nLUCY Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something? \nLINDA I'd rather not talk about it. \nLUCY You're not...an orphan are you? \nLINDA My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth. \nLUCY Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time. \nLINDA Thank you. You're very kind. \nLUCY I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was something tragic if you show up without a wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this. \nLucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to Linda. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SCHOOL PLAYING FIELDS. DAY \nGirls in their adorable school gym outfits run around playing field hockey. Linda hangs back on the outskirts of the mob. She sees Myra put her stick between Lucy's legs and trip her. Linda stops to help Lucy up. \nMR. DANVERS You may go, Linda. But try not to clown around in the future. \nShe meekly heads for the door. He turns to erase the blackboard. Something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. Then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL. DAY \nSelena's Cadillac drives past the school. softball in front. Girls are playing softball in front. \nINT. CADILLAC \nBianca is driving. Selena sits in the back brooding. Her tarot cards and the metal gargoyle box are beside her on the open counter of a  built-in bar. She suddenly calls out to Bianca. \nSELENA Stop the car! \nBianca jams on the brakes and the car screeches to a halt. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE SCHOOL \nThe girls stop their softball game and turn to stare at the Cadillac. \nINT. CADILLAC \nSelena is gathering up her scattered things from the floor of the car. \nSELENA I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. \nBIANCA What is it? \nSELENA The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it. \nThe metal gargoyle box is glowing with an inner radiance. \nSELENA What does it mean? \nBIANCA The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . \nThey stare out the car window at the girls' softball game, which was resumed. \nSELENA Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? \nBIANCA Softball. \nSELENA It must be the girls. One of the girls. \nBIANCA But which one? \nSELENA Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention. \nBianca starts up the car again and drives smoothly away. \nSELENA We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out. \nBIANCA And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy! \nThe car swerves slightly. \nSELENA Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? \nBIANCA Sorry, mistress. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DORM. DAY \nLinda is standing at the bathroom' window of her dorm room, looking outside with a melancholy expression. She slides the curtain across the window, so no one can see in. \nINT. LINDA AND LUCY'S ROOM. DAY \nLucy runs in, fresh from her softball game, and sits down on the bed as usual to dig the mud out of her cleats. Lucy's bed is still a riot of stuffed animals and frilly lace pillows. Linda's bed' across the room is austere and almost monastic, with no family photos, posters, or toys. \nLUCY Hey, Linda, you in there? \nLINDA (o.s.) Uh-huh. \nLinda answers from inside the shut bathroom door. LUCY How much longer you gonna be? \nLINDA (o.s.) Not long. I'm cutting my hair. \nSELENA Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself. \nSelena closes the door while he's off his guard. Nigel takes a pocket mirror out of his shoulder bag and stares with horror at his reflection. His face is erupting all over in ugly red blotches. \nNIGEL Nasty bitch! \nEXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S MANSION. SUNSET \nEthan staggers across the lawn, still clutching his head, obviously very ill. As he disappears through the shrubbery on the far side of the lawn, he mutters drunkenly to himself. \nETHAN Rhododendron.. . .honeysuckle. . . \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nSelena enters and finds Ethan gone. She is furious. She walks to the French doors. \nSELENA Ethan. Come back. You'll spoil everything! INT. THE DANVERS' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nLinda is playing chess with MR. Danvers, while his wife knits on the sofa. \nMRS. DANVERS I think you'd better be getting back to the dorm, Linda. The housemother'll expect you to sign in by eight. \nLinda stands up from the chessboard. \nLINDA Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers. \nMR. DANVERS What? Me? \nLINDA Sure. Mate in five moves. \nShe moves the pieces chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk, chonk... \nLINDA ...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't see it coming. Well, bye. \nShe walks out the door into the night. \nMRS . DANVERS What a lovely child. Such nice manners. We must have her back, don't you think? \nMR. Danvers 'grunts absent-mindedly, bemused at his loss. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nSelena paces agitatedly in her living room. Finally she stops in front of the ornate mirror hanging on the wall. She puts her hand on the heavy veil covering it. \nSELENA Show me Ethan. \nShe rips aside the veil. The IMAGE IN THE MIRROR SHOWS ETHAN STAGGERING DRUNKENLY THROUGH THE NIGHT COWN THE CENTRE WHITE LINE OF A HIGHWAY. CARS WHIZZ PAST HIM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. \nSELENA The silly fool! EXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. NIGHT \nLucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her Thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at Rindge Tech. Other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. Lucy catches sight of Linda walking along the side of the road. \nLUCY Hey, Linda! (to the boy) It's my roommate. You'll love her. She's really off the wall! \nLucy jumps out of her car, runs over to Linda, and whispers urgently in her ear. \nLUCY Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away... \nLINDA Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight. \nLUCY Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you. \nLINDA It doesn't seem right. \nLUCY Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl? \nLinda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. Cars honk and zoom past him. \nLINDA Look at that guy! \nLucy whirls around and looks. \nLUCY What a space cadet. (yelling and waving) Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street! \nEthan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously. \nINSERT.  ETHAN'S P.O.V. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nSelena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay. \nETHAN (in the mirror) God...you're beautiful. \nSELENA That was meant for me! \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER. RING OF FIRE \nSUPERGIRL Thank you. I'm going to close this up again. \nETHAN Wait...don't leave me in here... \nSUPERGIRL It's for your own protection. \nShe pulls the massive steel jaws shut and tears the scoop off the bulldozer with a sound of rending metal. Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION. \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT \nThe entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle. \nEXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT \nSupergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside. \nETHAN (calling from inside) What's happening? \nSUPERGIRL (shouting over the wind) I'm taking you to the hospital. \nETHAN (within) Let me out. I have to talk to you. \nSUPERGIRL Later. \nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. POST FIRE. NIGHT \nThe firemen have smothered the fire with a blanket of foam. The blackened bulldozer minus its front scoop stands next to the smashed station wagon. A bewildered policeman is searching for victims. \nPOLICEMAN Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's no casualties. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nBianca enters and sees Selena staring raptly at the mirror. BIANCA I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger? \nSELENA It's what we were warned about. \nSelena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first. \nBIANCA A Storm Dragon? \nSELENA No, a super girl. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT \nSupergirl lands with the bulldozer scoop in front of the emergency entrance. There is no one around. Supergirl rips open the sealed scoop with a loud noise of rending metal. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT \nTWO INTERNS are chatting in the corridor near the doors. They jump at the sound of bending steel outside. \nFIRST INTERN What was that? \nSECOND INTERN Maybe we better take a look. \nEXT . HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. NIGHT \nSupergirl has strapped Ethan and the semi-conscious Lucy onto wheeled gurneys. \nETHAN Don't leave me. \nSUPERGIRL I have to. \nETHAN When can I see, you again ? \nSUPERGIRL Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye. \nShe gives the gurneys a shove. \nBIANCA Whatever you say. \nSELENA Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on. \nShe shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nMrs. Danvers is on the phone. \nMRS. DANVERS The housemother still doesn't answer. \nMrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression. \nMR. DANVERS Probably drunk again. I'm sure Linda got back all right. \nMRS. DANVERS We should have driven her. \nMr. Danvers stands up and puts on his jacket. \nMR. DANVERS I'll just drop by the school and. make sure she's all right. \nEXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DESERTED CAMPUS. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT \nLinda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. , \nINT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT \nLinda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky. \nINT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT \nLinda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood. \nSuddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus. \nEXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT. \nThe dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing. \nFar away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake. \nINT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nLinda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared\" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut. \nEXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT \nHUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of\" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda. \nINT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nLINDA Hey, that's my roommate's car! \nDetermination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL! \nEXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT \nSupergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice. \nSUPERGIRL Leave this place and do no harm. \nSomething picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken. \nShe launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades. \nSupergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her. \nEXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING \nAgain and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below. \nEXT. CAMPUS \nSuddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. \nShe shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy. \nLINDA I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car. \nLUCY Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D. \nJimmy keeps looking at Linda. \nJIMMY Do you have any theories about last night? \nLINDA Theories? \nJIMMY How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- - \nLUCY (overlapping) Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second? \nJIMMY -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural? \nLINDA I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is. \nJIMMY Can I quote you? \nLucy hands Jimmy a stainless steel urinal. \nLUCY Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die? \nJIMMY Oh, sure. \nHe steps into Lucy's bathroom with the urinal and fills it with water from her shower. Lucy grabs Linda's arm and whispers urgently in her ear. \nLUCY Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. \nLINDA He's nice. \nLUCY Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead! \nJimmy emerges from the bathroom with his daffodils neatly arranged in the stainless steel jug. \nJIMMY Where is your cousin Clark, by the way? \nLINDA He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation. \nJIMMY I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop ! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOSPITAL. ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON \nBianca drives Selena's Cadillac up to the emergency entrance and parks in the ambulance zone. Selena get out of the back seat in a dramatic opera cape of raw silk with opal trim. \nSELENA (to Bianca) This won't take long. Keep the motor running. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON \nSelena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her. \nINT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY \nHe is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe. \nSelena steps beside the bed. He looks up. \nETHAN Oh no, not you again. \nSELENA What an adorable hat. \nETHAN They think I have a concussion. \nSELENA And you think you're in love. \nETHAN I know it. \nSELENA This \"love\" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion. \nETHAN Why should I believe you? \nSELENA It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl. \nA team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets. \nThe surgical team doesn't look up from their work. \nSeveral cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up. \nNURSE Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas problem. \nDOCTOR I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch. \nINT. X-RAY ROOM \nEthan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut. \nHe hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him. \nEthan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct. \nINT. DUCT \nEthan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM \nLucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor. \nLUCY Omigod. \nA DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT. \nDELIVERY BOY Where you want this? \nLUCY Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him a tip, Jimmy. \nJimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan. \nJIMMY Gosh, what do you suppose .that is? \nLINDA Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy. \nLUCY You're not gonna stay for the ice cream? \nLINDA I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers. \nLUCY Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming. \nHer phone rings and she picks it up. \nLUCY Phillip! When are you gonna come see me? \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR \nLinda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her. \nJIMMY Can I give you a lift? \nLINDA Oh, no thanks. \nJIMMY It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions. \nLinda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET \nEthan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze. \nSELENA Give up? \nEthan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator. \nETHAN Never! \nHe starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney. \nJIMMY There goes my Pulitzer Prize. \nLinda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL \nA red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof. \nEXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY \nEthan's grip fails and he falls. \nEXT. CHIMNEY. SKY \nSupergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above. \nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL \nSelena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY \nJimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs. \nJIMMY Darn! \nHe turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac. \nJIMMY Hey lady, did you see that? \nBianca gives him a glance of contempt. \nBIANCA See what? \nJIMMY The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in mid-air. \nBIANCA Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined. \nEXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET \nSupergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love. \nETHAN You're alive! She didn't kill you! \nSUPERGIRL Who didn't? \nETHAN That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you. \nSUPERGIRL You love me? \nETHAN My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms... \nSUPERGIRL We have to have a long talk about all this. \nETHAN I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT \nSelena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her aura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera. \nBIANCA Home? \nSELENA No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me. \nBIANCA (shrewdly) Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener? \nSelena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity. \nSELENA I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit whenever I want. \nShe gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image. \nINSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT \nSELENA Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven. \nOTHERS IN UNISON The Circle is complete. \nNIGEL You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. \nSELENA We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. \nINDIAN WOMAN But Superman has been away. \nSELENA It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She knows we exist.. \nELDERLY MAN Then she must be destroyed. \nNIGEL How did she find out about us? \nELDERLY MAN That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will become curious and learn more. When she learns we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will try to stop us. \nBIANCA We must destroy her first. \nERICA But how can we destroy her? \nSELENA By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all. \nNigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena. \nNIGEL You! You want to take our power for yourself! \nSelena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child. \nSELENA Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit. \nSelena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly. \nSELENA (continuing) Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice? \nNIGEL You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power. \nSELENA Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel? \nNIGEL Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart. \nSELENA Nonsense. \nNigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror. \nFOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY. \nThen Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her? \nBIANCA Enough quibbling. Let us vote. \nThey all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection. \nSELENA I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree? \nNigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. \nNIGEL I have no choice. \nHis knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon. \nThe house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain around her neck and drops it into the Coffer. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY \nEthan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him. \nSUPERGIRL Ethan, what IS wrong? \nEthan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair. \nETHAN She said it wouldn't last. \nSUPERGIRL What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you? \nSUPERGIRL I don't see why not. \nETHAN But what if---it wasn't real? \nSUPERGIRL Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever. \nEthan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again. \nETHAN Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think? \nSUPERGIRL Are you asking me for a \"date\"? \nETHAN Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available. \nSUPERGIRL Aren't you forgetting about Selena? \nETHAN She'll forget about us eventually. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nIn the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island. \nSUPERGIRL (image) There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil... \nETHAN (image) I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROPIAL ISLAND \nSupergirl becomes very excited. \nSUPERGIRL That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? \nETHAN In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there. \nSUPERGIRL I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park. \nShe stands up. \nETHAN Wait. Don't leave me. \nSUPERGIRL You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. \nHe stands up and takes her hand. \nETHAN Before you go... \nSUPERGIRL What? \nETHAN Just one kiss. For old times' sake. \nSUPERGIRL And you can see how you feel about me, right? \nETHAN Yes. \nShe closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away. \nSUPERGIRL Ethan! \nSupergirl flies into the air. \nEXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY \nSupergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards. \nEXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY \nSupergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before. \nEXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY \nSupergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet. \nEXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN \nSupergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right. \nINT. CONSERVATORY \nSupergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning. \nSUPERGIRL Ethan! \nShe leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. \nThe real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall. \nSelena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him. \nSELENA Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever. \nSupergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field. \nINT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR \nSupergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison. \nSUPERGIRL Ethan! Don't let her do this! \nBeyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl. \nSUPERGIRL No. No. It isn't true. \nThe image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness. \nEXT. SPACE \nThe flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears. \nEXT. PHANTOM ZONE \nAnother kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY. \nShe hops a few more times, with no more success. \nShe picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected. \nSuddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away. \nALURA'S VOICE Kara, where are you? \nKARA Mother? I can hardly hear you. \nALURA. S VOICE Kara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared from the scanners... \nKARA I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. And I'm weak. \nALURA'S VOICE Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the Power Source. The City is dying. \nKARA Then send someone else. I failed. \nALURA'S VOICE We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no longer have the power to push through. \nKARA But Mother, I'm lost. \nALURA' S VOICE You must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . . \nThe rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. \nKARA Mother---I tried. I really tried. \nKara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY \nEstablishing shot. \nINT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY \nThe DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. \nZALTAR A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid them. And you should too. \nZaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his \"tree\" in Argo City. \nSUPERGIRL ...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam...\" \nZALTAR What? Palace? Hardly. \nSUPERGIRL Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City... \nZALTAR Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. Must try something new. \nINT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE \nHe helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects. \nSUPERGIRL It's lovely. . . \nZALTAR No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness. \nSUPERGIRL Are you happy, Zaltar? \nZALTAR What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. \nSUPERGIRL But what about other people? Don't you miss them? \nThey have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction. \nZALTAR I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise. \nHe carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp. \nSUPERGIRL You look at them? How? \nZALTAR The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools. \nZaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor. \nHe passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy. \nZALTAR There you see? What could be more boring than that? \nHe waves his hand, and the image disappears. \nSUPERGIRL Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from? \nZaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls. \nZALTAR It'll only make you sad. \nHe shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image. \nZALTAR This goes closer. This moves it around. And this begins. \nHe gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO : \nEXT. WALL STREET.  DAY \nThe financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on. \nINT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY \nChaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles. \nEXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY \nPeople are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock. \nEXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY \nThe CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO: \nINT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE \nA mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward. \nSECRETARY No more audiences today. Go home. All of you. \nJIMMY I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know. \nThere is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes. \nLUCY Hey! Ethan! \nETHAN Hmmm? \nLUCY Remember me? We were in a disaster together. \nETHAN . Oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher. \nLUCY Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here? \nETHAN A little. \nLUCY Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place. \nETHAN I'll mention it upstairs. \nHe turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve. \nJIMMY The blonde girl who saved your life---where is she now? \nEthan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain. \nETHAN She's gone. No one will ever see her again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE \nSupergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders. \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar, please help me. \nZALTAR Of course, my dear. What can I do? \nSUPERGIRL Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me. \nZaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers. \nZALTAR There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. \nSUPERGIRL If there's a way in, there must be a way out. \nZALTAR No, that's not true---there's well...no-- \nHe suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces. \nZALTAR There is a way. \nSUPERGIRL I knew it! \nZALTAR But it's impossible. \nSUPERGIRL Why? \nZALTAR No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it. \nSupergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness. \nZALTAR I could do it. \nShe is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again. \nSUPERGIRL Then teach me how. \nZALTAR No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think. \nHe takes another sip of his drink. \nSUPERGIRL Tell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can. \nHe looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance. \nZALTAR Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question. \nSupergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors. \nINT. CONSERVATORY \nJimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns. \nJIMMY Hey, what gives? \nThe blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nSelena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme. \nSELENA All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till the last card's dealt. \nSelena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins. \nAll the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way. \nSUPERGIRL You've run out of things to throw, Selena. SELENA Not yet. \nSelena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack. \nETHAN It's her shadow-self! Her dark side! \nSUPERGIRL How do I fight it? \nETHAN Turn it against her. \nSupergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds. \nThere are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious. \nREAL SELENA Power of Shadow, kill her!! \nThe Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice. \nSECOND SELENA No. I am your mistress. Do not harm me. \nREAL SELENA Don't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying. \nSECOND SELENA You are my shadow, you must obey me. \nThe Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow. \nEthan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock. \nETHAN I've got it! The Power Source! \nThe Real Se1ena cries out with despair. \nAnd then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her. \nREAL SELENA (terrified) No! Stop! Please! \nEthan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. \nSECOND SELENA Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City. \nETHAN It is you, then, really? \nWithout a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips. \nSECOND SELENA Well? \nETHAN It's you all right. \nSECOND SELENA I'll make it easy for you. \nShe again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand. \nETHAN I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me. \nSUPERGIRL I never doubted you for a moment. \nREAL SELENA Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying... \n", "test1_input": "CUT TO: \nINT.

DAY \nMr. & Mrs. Danvers and Linda sit outside under the trees at a table piled high with delicious home cooked food. ,The dog begs for scraps. As the scene progresses (MOS) the Danvers bring Linda out of her shyness until they all laugh together sharing food, jokes and happiness. A. dreamlike moment of nostalgia from everyone's childhood. \nINT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nSelena, at her most glamorous, in silk hostess pajamas and scads of pearls, stands looking out the French, doors of her mansion. She is staring shamelessly at ETHAN, a handsome young landscape gardener. Bianca is standing beside Selena. \nBIANCA Is he your entertainment for tonight? \nSELENA He will be. In about five minutes. \nBIANCA Have fun. \nBianca exits, and Selena waves to Ethan from the French doors. \nEXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN. DAY. \nEthan is sketching the house, adding new trees and shrubs in his drawing. He sees Selena waving, and walks over to her. \nINT. SELENA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nSELENA Finished your estimate? \nETHAN Well, there's several ways to go . \nSELENA Come in, have a drink, we'll talk. \nShe ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth. \nSELENA You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around. \nETHAN I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service. \nSELENA I bet they do. \nETHAN What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire. \nSELENA Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage. \nEthan spreads his drawings out on his knees. \nETHAN Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending on how alkaline your soil is. \nSelena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. She picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses. \nSELENA I just love plants and growing things. It must be wonderful to have green thumbs. Cheers! \nEthan looks at the drink with misgiving. \nETHAN Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day. \nSelena gestures outside. SELENA But look, it's almost sundown! \n", "test1_true": "ETHAN Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some honeysuckle there and there... \nSelena pouts exaggeratedly. \nSELENA Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family recipe, I'm famous for them. \nEthan pauses. He doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle. \nETHAN What is it? \nSELENA A passionfruit smoothee. \nETHAN Well, just one. \nHe takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast. \nSELENA To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together. \nETHAN I'll drink to that. \nHe takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles. \nETHAN Hmmm. Delicious! \nHe tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. Selena watches him triumphantly. \nETHAN Now, about my fee... \nHe suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. She leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers. \nSELENA Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes and be all mine. \nThe DOORBELL RINGS.  Selena looks up with annoyance. \nSELENA If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again... \nShe angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at Ethan. \nSELENA Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION \nNigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. Behind him his Porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ETHAN'S NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING painted on it. Selena opens the door, sees Nigel, and tries to close it. But Nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open. \nSELENA Nigel, get lost. \nNIGEL I have to talk to you. \nSELENA You're wasting your breath. \nNIGEL You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft. \nSELENA I could teach you a thing or two now. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nEthan opens his eyes. He rises from the couch and stands there swaying deliriously. \nINSERT. P.O.V. OF ETHAN \nThe room swirls and distorts around him in garish nightmare colours. \nBACK TO SCENE \nEthan clutches his head as though it were splitting apart, and lurches out of the French doors into the terrace. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR OF MANSION \nSelena is listening impatiently to Nigel, and staring oddly at him. \nNIGEL ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? \nSELENA I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. \nNigel is rather vain about his smooth olive complexion, so he is completely thrown off his stride. \nNIGEL Nothing's wrong with my skin. \n", "test1_id": 1464, "test2_input": "ETHAN You're not afraid are you? \nSUPERGIRL Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand. \nETHAN If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school. \nSUPERGIRL Well...I guess one is all right. \nShe closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward. \nSUPERGIRL Is this how? \nETHAN Terrific. \nTheir lips meet. Zowie. \nSELENA What a touching scene! \nHer voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her. \nSUPERGIRL Who are you ? \nSELENA I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry. \nSUPERGIRL I don't scare that easily. \nSelena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box. \nSELENA All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, nobody can. \nShe holds the gargoyle box out toward the Ferris wheel. \nSELENA Coffer of Shadow, show your Power! \nINSERT C.U. OF THE BOLTS HOLDING ETHAN'S GONDOLA TO THE FERRIS WHEEL: THE BOLTS UNSCREW AND FALL OUT. \nBACK TO SCENE \nEthan yells as his gondola falls off the Ferris wheel and down onto the tent, which covers the DODGEM CARS. \nINT. DODGEM CARS TENT \nHe falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars. \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK \nSupergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain. \nSupergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena. \nSelena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her. \nSUPERGIRL That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while. \nSELENA A cheap trick. \nSUPERGIRL Cheap but effective. \nINT. DODGEM CAR TENT \nEthan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky. \nETHAN Supergirl'? \nHe looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly. \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK \nSelena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works. \nSELENA Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. Ka-ma-hoochie! \nBianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed. \nBIANCA Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you. \nSELENA Shut up, and get me a hacksaw. \n", "test2_true": "BIANCA Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow? \nSELENA (evasively) I don't feel like it right now. \nBIANCA She didn't take it from you, did she? \nSELENA That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools. \nBIANCA There's no need. I learned the Craft from my \t\t\t\t\t\tgrandmother. \nBianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it. \nBIANCA Sycoraka f'kah s'koo... \nThe bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity. \nSELENA Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of the seven. \nBianca bows. \nBIANCA Yes, mistress. \nBianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX. \nSELENA There you are. Come to mama. \nShe takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY \nSupergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene. \nSUPERGIRL I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places. \nETHAN It's paradise . We could be very happy here. \nSUPERGIRL But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her. \nETHAN You can't just abandon me.  Alone. \nHis words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents. \nSUPERGIRL I'll stay for a while. \nEthan is filled with enthusiasm. \nETHAN Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and--- \nSUPERGIRL Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours. \nEthan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly. \nSUPERGIRL Well, maybe a little longer than that. \nShe smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT \nRolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily. \nSELENA You're late. \nELD ERL Y MAN The President was giving a speech. I couldn't just walk out. \nSELENA You're more afraid of the President than me??? \nELDERLY MAN No, of course not. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT \nWaiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment. \nSelena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room. \n", "test2_id": 1465, "test3_input": "SELENA I'm ready for her. I'll show you. \nSelena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan. \nEXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY \nMR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan. \nSELENA Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one. \nSelena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool. \nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL \nThe empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. \nBACK TO SCENE \nETHAN Why the empty cage? \nSELENA That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan. \nSelena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees. \nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL \nBehind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSelena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight. \nETHAN What...? \nSELENA You don't get this far without paying...a certain price. \nShe turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan. \nMR. DANVERS If only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her. \nMRS . DANVERS I'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you. \nShe stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her. \nJIMMY (shyly) I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens. \nLUCY Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention. \nJIMMY You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time? \nLUCY You bet your ass. \nJIMMY Why didn't you tell me? \nLUCY You're supposed to guess. \nShe reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers. \nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX \nZaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses. \nSUPERGIRL Why are you stopping? \nZALTAR Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do. \nHe continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand. \nZALTAR Oh dear! \nThe vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards. \nZALTAR The wand. Use it. \nSupergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion. \nZALTAR Good girl! That's the way! \n", "test3_true": "ZALTAR You can use the wand. \nSUPERGIRL Better than when I was a child. \nShe hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress. \nZALTAR I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like your mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM \nSelena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out. \nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX \nFlaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress. \nZALTAR What's that? Never saw anything like that. \nSUPERGIRL Don't stop. Keep moving. \nZALTAR Yes, mustn't stop. \nSUPERGIRL (grimly) It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work. \nAnother flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex. \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar. Use the wand! \nZALTAR Too late. Too late. Save yourself. \nHe is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears. \nZALTAR (voice over) Goodbye... \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar! \nShe begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex. \nSUPERGIRL You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you. \nSuddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster. \nEXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND \nSupergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her. \nSUPERGIRL Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart. \nShe looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her. \nSUPERGIRL Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you. \nShe stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet. \nEXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN \nSupergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof. \nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM \nSupergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror. \nSUPERGIRL You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. \nETHAN She has hostages. \nSELENA The Danvers. And two of your little friends. \nSUPERGIRL It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for. \nEthan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck. \nINSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY. \nBACK TO SCENE \n", "test3_id": 1466}

INT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN 
The sun is breaking. 
INT. AMY'S CAR - SAME 
Amy listens to NPR as she pulls into the empty parking lot. Suddenly, she SLAMS on her brakes. ELIZABETH'S CAR is already there. Amy puts her car in park and gets out. She walks over to Elizabeth's car and feels the hood. 
AMY Cold. 
INT. J.A.M.S. - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The clicking of Amy's shoes ECHO through the empty hallway. She stops, takes off her shoes. She pitter-patters down the hall to Elizabeth's classroom and PEERS in. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - SAME 
Elizabeth is at the chalkboard, intently writing questions. She senses something in her periphery and looks over at her window. Nothing. Elizabeth goes back to work. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER 
Elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his backpack into class. 
ELIZABETH 
(TO GARRETT) Let's go, Sylvia Plath. Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe.. Elizabeth winces and glares at Garrett. The rest of the class enters, stops, noticing WORK PACKETS on each of their desks. 
CHASE 
(LOOKING AROUND) Where's the TV? 
ELIZABETH 
(ALL BUSINESS) Everyone, take your seats. Shawn turns to Spencer. 
SHAWN What do you think's going on? Spencer shrugs. 
ELIZABETH Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as they're opened for the first time. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (checking her notes) Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone? 
GARRETT Because she's a cry baby. The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett. 
ELIZABETH 
(TO GARRETT) Get out. Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the door. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus. 
SASHA (raising hand and answering) You never assigned it to us. 
ELIZABETH Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) On the first hundred pages. 
PANDEMONIUM. 
SASHA You can't do that! I have band and jazz band tonight! 
SHAWN We haven't had homework all year! 
ELIZABETH Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator. 
(BEAT) Things are about to change. Recess is over.

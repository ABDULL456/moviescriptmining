THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  14 \nAnd it is nine years earlier. The faces come from an audience watching a play. They find the performance hysterical. \n15   EXT.

Well? \nTWO MEN \nwalk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes have seen better days. \nHis companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON (22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and extremely enthusiastic. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Wonderful, isn't it? \nOXFORD (frowning slightly) Well, it's certainly... big. \npg. 9 \nSOUTHAMPTON I promise you, Edward, you've seen nothing like it before! Nothing! \nOXFORD Bricklayers and whores watching Aristophones?   You're quite right, Henry, not only have I never witnessed it, I'm not sure I care to. \nSOUTHAMPTON (teasing) You're an elitist, you know that, Edward? \nOxford pauses at the entrance. \nOXFORD There won't be puppets, will there? \nSouthampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER, who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay outside) inside. \nUSHER My lords... \nINT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nThe usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford observes everything as they walk. \nSOUTHAMPTON The stage-craft is quite spectacular. Far more elaborate than anything I've seen at court. I've witnessed be- headings that god as my witness look as real as at the Tower, cannons fired in battle... \nThey come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much like a match-stick girl. \nSELLING-MAID Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord? \nSouthampton waves her off as they follow the usher up another flight of stairs. \npg. 10 \nSOUTHAMPTON ...and last week, they had some sort of a device to hoist cherubs into the air and fly over the entire audience! \nOXFORD An ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s. Deus ex machina. Machine of the Gods. \nAnd as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches glimpses of the stage and performance through the rafters and over the heads of the attending audience. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes into a situation from which they couldn't write their way out-- \nOxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost despite himself. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) --Out came the ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s... As when Hippolytus is saved by Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens... Always good for an ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s was Euripides \nOxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton. \nThey come to the third floor and enter the box seating area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and sees- \nFROM OXFORD'S POV \nAudience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids SELLING food-- the actors ACTING... \nIt's alive.   Magical. \nBACK TO OXFORD \nOxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it. \nON-STAGE \nThe actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner. He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly. \nAnother actor SPENCER (30) plays \"FASTIDIOUS\"; a pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman. \npg. 11 \nHe wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays \"Sogliardo\" \nSHAKESPEARE And whither were you riding now, signior? \n\"FASTIDIOUS\" Who, I? What a silly jest's that! Whither should I ride but to the court? \n", "test1_true": "The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks below at a buxom young lady among the \"groundlings\". He smiles seductively. She smiles back. \nBACKSTAGE \nJonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking the lines with the actors. \nIN THE RAISED SEATING \nA group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an air of judgement. They are: Christopher \"Kit\" MARLOWE (32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered a bit of a hack by his colleagues. \nThey are called the \"Mermaid's Wits\" because they frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern. \nNASHE (takes a swig of ale) His second play, and almost a full house. (burps) He's got a wit, does Jonson. \nMARLOWE That might be so, but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find it, and when you have it, it's not worth the search! \npg. 12 \nThe others smile as a WOMAN passes. \nWOMAN Ale!   Ale!! \nDEKKER Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will you? Henslowe still owes me for \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". \nMARLOWE (retrieving coins) That would be because no one saw \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". \nDEKKER Ale here! \nMarlowe gives the woman a few pennies as-- \nNASHE Kit... Isn't that one of your unrequited loves in the box over there? \nMarlowe glances across the theater and spots Southampton siting next to Oxford. \nMARLOWE (frowns) But with whom? Tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as that! \nNashe squints. \nNASHE I think-- yes, by the beard, that's the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker used to play for him. Had his own acting troupe for private Court performances and the like. \nDEKKER I wonder if he needs any material? \nMARLOWE Certainly not any of yours. \nNASHE No, no-- that was years ago. Had a falling out with the Queen, I heard. He's more of a recluse than a patron these days. \npg. 13 \nON STAGE \nShakespeare points to \"Fastidious\". \nSHAKESPEARE Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the earth; man, he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub! \nShakespeare struts around as though he owned the place. The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in laughter. \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) He sleeps with a musk-cat every night, and walks all day hang'd in perfumed chains for penance. \nA GROUNDLING Oi!   So that's what I been smelling! \nMore groundlings laugh.     Interestingly-- \nNOBLEMEN \nin the box seats do not. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to the groundlings. \nSHAKESPEARE He has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly, the poor man's brain is lighter than his feather... \nAs the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see: \nA NOBLEMAN \nwith a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him as he goes. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare smiles triumphantly. \npg. 14 \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) He is a good and empty puff, but he loves you well, signior. I wish you well with him. \nOXFORD \nWatches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass by. \nBACKSTAGE \nLater in the play... \nShakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson, and grabs him. \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) Jonson! Wonderful dialogue! Wonderful. I hope your next-- \nHENSLOWE (O.C.) Will!   Will Shakespeare! \nShakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE (50'S) heading his way. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) That's not ale in that goblet is it? \nShakespeare hides the goblet behind his back. \nSHAKESPEARE Ale? Me? Drink during a performance? I am a professional sir! (burps) A complete and-- \nHe is interrupted by SCREAMS.

THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   48 \nThe battle rages on stage. \nOne hardy audience member starts to actually ATTACK one of the French \"soldiers\" himself. He's quickly joined by a few comrades-- and it quickly becomes a madhouse; half play, half real fight, as more audience members join the \"battle\". The play quickly degenerates into a bloody brawl between actors and audience. \n49   EXT/INT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   49 \nSouthampton arrives at the theater.   He jumps   off his horse, and hurries-- \nINTO THE STAIRWELL \njumping two steps at a time. We HEAR the sound of APPLAUSE. The play is now over. Southampton hurries into-- \npg. 53 \nOXFORD'S BOX \nHe sees Oxford, who is applauding.    All the actors of the play are taking their bows. \nSOUTHAMPTON William Cecil's convinced the Queen that only Essex can save Ireland from the Revolt. \nOxford processes this. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) I've pledged to go with him, Edward. We sail in an hour. \nOXFORD Henry-- \nSOUTHAMPTON I ask for your blessing, Edward. \nOXFORD I can't give it to you. \nIN THE GALLERIES \nNASHE I for one wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours. (stands) Playwright! Playwright!! \nMarlowe and others join in.   And-- \nBACKSTAGE \nShakespeare, standing next to a small table of props, quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them stained. He grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries-- \nON STAGE \n--where he bows deeply, loving the adulation. \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nSOUTHAMPTON If he is to be my king, then it is my sacred duty to be with him in battle. \npg. 54 \nOxford tries to understand Southampton, but then notices Shakespeare on stage. His mouth opens in shock, and he turns to look across the theater at-- \nJONSON \nwho guiltily looks away.   Marlowe's mouth is open, his hands stop applauding. \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nSouthampton is angered by Oxford's distraction. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) I am sorry to have disturbed your entertainment. \nAnd he exits. \nOXFORD Henry-- Henry!! \nBut the younger man is gone. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare bows, then-- \nSHAKESPEARE I, I...

Then he opens a cabinet. \nIn it, manuscript after manuscript are stacked.     Jonson looks behind him, stunned by the number. \nOxford looks up and down the cabinet. He pulls one out, decides no, and puts it back, looking for just the right one... He pulls another out, then hands it to Jonson. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) A romantic tragedy.

I've seen him before. \nOxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking while he finishes writing a thought. It's a long thought. Anne is obviously annoyed, and interrupts him. \nANNE (CONT'D) Edward-- we must discuss our Bridget's dowry. \nOXFORD (looking up - confused) Dowry? \nHe remembers when he spies his daughter. \nANNE She cannot go into marriage without a dowry that is becoming to the daughter of the Earl Oxford. \nOXFORD I can give her Brooke House and a hundred pounds. \nBRIDGET A hundred pounds? Father?     Mother! \nOXFORD That is all we have to give at the moment. \nThe matter over, Oxford goes back to his writing. \nANNE (furious) Edward. Edward! Speak to me! Our family is in financial ruins, and, and you, you play the flute while Rome burns! \nOxford turns. \npg. 57 \nOXFORD Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned. \nAnd then he goes back to writing. \nANNE For god's sake, who cares Edward? When your own daughter can't even have a suitable dowry? \nShe stares at him. \nANNE (CONT'D) My god, you're writing again, aren't you? After you agreed-- after my father expressly forbade it! \nOxford turns to her, full of emotion \nOXFORD Anne-- If you could have seen them-- the mob...

Why must you write?! Why must you continue to humiliate this family? \nHe stares at her, almost uncomprehendingly.   Then-- \nOXFORD The voices, Anne... The voices. I, I can't stop them... They, they come when I sleep, when I wake, when I sup, when I, I, I walk down a hall!

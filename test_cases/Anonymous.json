THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK                       2 \nThe sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for their shows. Cabs line the streets. \nSIDE ALLEY \nA cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and rushes to the side entrance of a theater. \nIn the background we see that the title of the play, \"Anonymous\", is written on the theatre's marquee... \n3   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK                       3 \nWe follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make- up, etc... \nTITLES CONTINUE. \n4   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE/EMPTY STAGE - DUSK           4 \nThe curtains are still closed, and the sound of the audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. . \nStagehands are moving stage lights as-- \nA STAGE MANAGER \ntakes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other. \nHe looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in the background. \nThe curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the audience dies down. \npg. 2 \n5   INT. BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                5 \nThe man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a single light on him. He is \"PROLOGUE\". (We will see the same actor later as the \"Prologue\" of Henry V). \n\"Prologue\" regards his audience for a   beat before: \nPROLOGUE Soul of the Age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! Our Shakespeare, rise... (beat, repeating) Our Shakespeare... For he is all of ours, is he not? The most performed playwright of all time! The author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language. And yet... And yet... (beat) Not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand. In four hundred years, not one document-- be it poem, play, diary or even a simple letter. (beat) He was born the son of a glove-maker, and at some unknown time, armed with but an elementary school education, he went to London where, the story goes, he became an actor and eventually a playwright. \nOFF STAGE \nA stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER. \nAnother stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES. \nON STAGE \n\"Prologue\" opens his umbrella. \nPROLOGUE (CONT'D) He died at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife and two daughters who were, like Shakespeare's own father, irrefutably illiterate. \npg. 3 \nOFF STAGE \nIn the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to RAIN. \nPROLOGUE (O.C.) (CONT'D) His will famously left his second best bed to his widow. But it made no mention of a single book or manuscript. \nThe actor who will play \"Ben JONSON\" (mid 30's) appears in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of Elizabethan \"soldiers\" strap on their swords. \nON STAGE \n\"Prologue\" continues, as do TITLES. \nPROLOGUE (CONT'D) Is it possible Shakespeare owned no books at his death because... he could not read? That he wrote no letters because he, like his father before him and his children after him, could not write? (lets that sink in, then) Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost; his biography made not by history... but by conjecture. His story not written with facts, but with... imagination. \nThe rain has intensified. \"Prologue\" turns and the camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END.... \nPROLOGUE (CONT'D) (more energetic) So! Let me offer you a different story. A darker story... Of quills and swords. Of power and betrayal. Of a stage conquered, and a throne lost! \nA FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of RAIN are visible. No stage, no \"Prologue\". Then, trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We are: \npg. 4 \n6    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT                             6 \nJonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street toward a large circular theater. \nHe frantically opens the wooden door to the theater-- \n7    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT                                 7 \n--and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards the stage as-- \n8    EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            8 \nAbout a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard. \nPOLE Break it down! \nAnd several of the guards charge the door with their pikes, HITTING it hard. \nPOLE (CONT'D) Again! \n9    INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            9 \nJonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view just as-- \nComplete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13). \nSIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD \n--jumps on stage. \npg. 15 \nPOLE This play has been declared seditious and illegal by Lord William Cecil! \nThe audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil. \nPOLE (CONT'D) All are herewith ordered to disperse immediately! \nA GROUNDLING Why don't you disperse William Cecil's arse! \nPOLE Arrest that man! \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nSOUTHAMPTON Damn it all.    Well! Off to Essex's then? \nHe gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in the real drama below as everyone hurries from the theater. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Edward? \nOxford turns to him, distracted, and nods. \nON STAGE \nJonson pushes his way on stage. \nJONSON (to Pole) Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about-- \nPOLE Oi, is that right, is it?    And you know this because? \nJONSON Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And- \nPOLE Arrest him as well! \nJonson is grabbed by guards. \npg. 16 \n17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17 \nJonson is THROWN into the cell, the door SLAMMED behind him. \nJONSON (to the door) A pox on you! (beat) And your carbuncled father! \nJonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen or so other prisoners. \nESSEX (O.S.) People taxed to the point of starvation, Spain running the New World, open revolt in Ireland, Catholic plots everywhere you turn... \nCUT TO: \n18   INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                        18 \nRobert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will learn, very ambitious. \nESSEX ...and how do the Cecils spend their time and energy? Shutting a theater! A theater, for god's sake? It's madness! No wonder the mob hates them so! \nThe court is inside, and slightly different from today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat like racquet-ball. \nOxford sits on a bench, watching.   Essex SLAMS a shot, but it goes-- \nOXFORD Out! \nEssex looks furious, but holds his tongue.   Southampton prepares to serve. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) (to Southampton) Henry, how many people were at that play? \npg. 17 \nSouthampton pauses before serving. \nSOUTHAMPTON Hmm? I'm not sure, two thousand, maybe more. \nSouthampton SERVES.   Essex returns, and another heated rally begins. \nOXFORD And how many performances are there of a play like that? \nSOUTHAMPTON Five or six I suppose. \nHe HITS the ball again, and this time Essex misses it. \nESSEX By the--! \nOXFORD (to Essex) So! Ten thousand souls. All listening to the writings of one man-- the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power. \nESSEX (snorts) And when did words ever win a kingdom? I think I'll keep my sword, thank you very much. \nSouthampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essex's naivet\u00e9. \n19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19 \nSouthampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis clothes and into their normal clothes, assisted by two valets. \nESSEX (to the valets) Leave us. (they exit) Henry... Some of my men have... intercepted... some of William Cecil's recent correspondence with King James of Scotland... \npg. 18 \nSouthampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is serious. \nESSEX (CONT'D) Cecil's all but promising him the throne... \nSOUTHAMPTON To James?   Elizabeth would never agree to- \nESSEX Elizabeth is old. Ill. Not of her old mind. Sometimes she doesn't even recognize me. And yet, still she refuses to name an heir. \nSOUTHAMPTON But a Scotsman? On the Tudor throne? \nA FOOTMAN clears his throat and-- \nFOOTMAN By the grace of god, her majesty, Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and Ireland! \nDOUBLE DOORS \nopen, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a wide collar. \nShe walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her (Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un-human. \nEssex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel- encrusted doublet. \nRobert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm. \nEssex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton-- \nESSEX (to Elizabeth) Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord of Southampton has a gift for you. \nELIZABETH (eyes sparkle) A gift? \nSOUTHAMPTON Yes, your grace, though not from me. \nSouthampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room OPENS. \nA DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music. \npg. 23 \nElizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face. \nRobert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified. \nELIZABETH Are you this gift, my precious little man? \nDWARF No, no, my most majestic majesty. I am a free man. My gift is a play, majesty. \nELIZABETH A play? \nThe dwarf bows his assent. \nROBERT CECIL (to the Dwarf) Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication, and heresy. You may tell your master that her majesty-- \nESSEX (interrupting) --Will gladly accept your gift. \nRobert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked. \nESSEX (CONT'D) (to Elizabeth) Of course that is if you so desire, majesty. (to Robert Cecil) The choice is her majesty's to make, not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert? \nRobert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the political tides around her. Then-- \nELIZABETH (to the dwarf) Comedy? Or tragedy? \nDWARF Comedy, majesty. \nELIZABETH (delighted) A comedy! (MORE) pg. 24 \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (beat) By whom? \nDWARF By... Anonymous, your majesty... \nELIZABETH Anonymous...? (then) Oh, but I do so admire his verse... \nElizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the Dwarf, who smiles brightly. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Lead us to this gift. \nAnd the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him. They exchange a knowing look as-- \nRobert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not happy with this turn of events as we hear-- \n\"QUINCE\" (O.S.) Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou art translated! \nCUT TO: \n23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23 \nSheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift \"stage\" surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides. \n\"BOTTOM\" I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. \nChairs have been brought out and put in rows in the grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a young woman. Essex is next to her. \npg. 25 \nON STAGE \nSeveral actors are mid-scene in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate and fantastical: \"Bottom\", who is costumed as a man-- except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, \"Quince\", a commoner, \"Puck\", played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid, and \"Titania\", Queen of the fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck hides behind a tree watching. \n\"BOTTOM\" (CONT'D) I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid. \nBACKSTAGE \nOxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep emotion in him. \nON STAGE \n\"BOTTOM\" (CONT'D) (sings) The ousel cock so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill-- \nTitania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur. \n\"TITANIA\" What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed? \nELIZABETH \nstrongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some memory in her. A pleasant memory. \nOXFORD \nwatches, delighted by her reaction. \nFROM HIS POV \nThirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by-- \nGUARD (O.S.) Jonson!    Ben Jonson! \nThe other prisoners make way as the guard approaches Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of parchment onto Jonson's lap. \nGUARD (CONT'D) You've been released. \nJonson looks at it, confused. \npg. 30 \nGUARD (CONT'D) Got powerful friends, now, don't you? \n26A   EXT. A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY                                26A \nJonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO-- Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat of arms on its chest. \nThe City of London is far in the distance. \nJonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat for a moment before-- \nJONSON And who are you? \nFrancesco just stares back. \nJONSON (CONT'D) And where are we going? \nFrancesco is silent. \nWIDER \nThe boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone. \nCUT TO: \nA RED ROSE \nas it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands.       We are: \n27    EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                                 27 \nOxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards him. \nBefore they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17). \nJonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand place. Jonson CLEARS his throat. \nJONSON My lord... \npg. 31 \nOXFORD The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think? \nJONSON It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord. \nOXFORD So it does.   So it does. \nJONSON I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you. \nOXFORD That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly. \nJonson doesn't know who he is talking about. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter. \nOxford looks over to his wife who watches them suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and Francesco to follow. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) It did, however, serve as helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name. \nJonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back to Anne. \nJONSON (in a panicked whisper) My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned? \nOXFORD Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it wasn't. (beat) But you are free, are you not? \nThey have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne watches them as they disappear into the maze. \npg. 32 \n28   EXT. MAZE - DAY                                           28 \nOxford turns to Jonson. \nOXFORD I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential. \nJONSON Thank you, my lord. \nOXFORD But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious. \nJONSON Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy-- \nOXFORD That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants. (beat) All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson? \nAs they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to his servant. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) (nods) Francesco. \nFrancesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and opens it. \nJONSON A play, my lord? \nOXFORD One you shall stage Bankside. \nJONSON Stage? \npg. 33 \nOXFORD Under your name. \nJONSON My name, my lord? \nFinally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford (now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are TUTORS. \nBoy Robert Cecil doesn't move. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) (to Young Oxford) I am sorry, my lord. But my son Robert prefers the company... of himself... \nBoy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his mother and sister. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne. \nYoung Anne curtsies. \nYOUNG ANNE I am sorry for your loss, my lord. The realm lost a great lord with your father's death. We hope you will be happy in our house-- \nBOY ROBERT CECIL (O.S.) Are you going to live here forever? \nEverybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has finally come over. \nYOUNG OXFORD (smiles) No.    Only until I reach my maturity. \nBOY ROBERT CECIL Why? \nWILLIAM CECIL Because the Queen has bade it so. (to Young Oxford) My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so. (MORE) \npg. 38 \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors. (indicates one of them) Seven to eight you shall be tutored in French by Mister Crane-- \nYOUNG OXFORD Monsieur. Ca me fait plaisir de vous connaitre. \nMaster Crane bows his head. \nWILLIAM CECIL Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Simmons. \nYOUNG OXFORD (in Greek) Dalon, an d'ego, hoti mathamata ge esti ha trafo psychas. \nBOY ROBERT CECIL Is that Homer? \nYOUNG OXFORD (sharp) No.   Plato. \nBoy Robert frowns at the correction. \nWILLIAM CECIL (slight frown, then) And you know your uncle, Mister Golding, who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient Latin texts into English. \nYOUNG OXFORD (in Latin) Continetne, ut spero, Ovidii Metamorphose? Mihi honori erit, patrue \nMister Golding bows his head in appreciation. \nWILLIAM CECIL Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing. \nWilliam Cecil seems to have finished. \npg. 39 \nYOUNG OXFORD (to William Cecil) And composition? Poetry? \nWILLIAM CECIL This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God. \nYOUNG OXFORD A sin? But surely there must be room for beauty and art in life, my lord. \nWILLIAM CECIL Not in this household. \n33   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                         33 \nYoung Oxford is fencing with a tutor. He's quite good. In fact, he's better than the tutor, who is twice his age. \nBoy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess against himself. \nYoung Oxford, with a fierce, beautifully executed attack, disarms his tutor. The tutor's sword FLIES into the air, and hits-- \nTHE CHESS BOARD \nmaking the pieces scatter. \nWIDER \nBoy Robert Cecil looks up, his face furious, to see Young Oxford coming over to him. \nYOUNG OXFORD You were losing anyway. \nBOY ROBERT CECIL I was also winning. \nYoung Oxford picks up the sword, throws it to his tutor, who catches it. \nBOY ROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) You know I am going to one day succeed my father at the Queen's side. Not you. \npg. 40 \nYoung Oxford motions to go, then picks up the black king, and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil, who can't catch it because of his deformity. It CLANGS on the floor. \nYOUNG OXFORD Really? \n34   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                           34 \nMoments later, the Young Oxford heads down the hall alone, heading for his rooms, his sword still in his hand. \nCUT TO: \nPOEMS \nneatly written on parchment.   We are: \n35   INT. CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORD'S ROOM - DAY               35 \nAnd a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly stuffing them into a bag. \nBut then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door-- he runs to it-- the door is locked! \nSo he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens, and Young Oxford enters. \nAfter a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss. Looks at his-- \nElizabeth's wig is being glued into place. \nELIZABETH Ireland? \nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN (THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE OF SCREEN AS NEEDED) \nWilliam Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has sneaked in the room behind him to listen in. \nWILLIAM CECIL There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. (beat) We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty. \nELIZABETH Replace?   With whom? \nWilliam Cecil hesitates slightly, then-- \nWILLIAM CECIL I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty. \nELIZABETH Essex?  To Ireland? (frowns) For how long? \nWILLIAM CECIL As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty. \nELIZABETH Impossible. He cannot be spared. We feel his counsel is of greater import with each passing day. \nNot what William Cecil wanted to hear. \nWILLIAM CECIL I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. (beat, a last-ditch effort) Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you. (MORE) \npg. 45 \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) Of burning you at the stake as a heretic. Give him a foot-hold in Ireland, and-- \nELIZABETH But Essex? \nWILLIAM CECIL Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. (clears his throat) Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in Ireland... \nELIZABETH And who would you advise to replace him? \nThree ladies-in-waiting approach with three different gown. Elizabeth studies them as: \nWILLIAM CECIL Sir Robert Cecil. \nELIZABETH Your son? \nWILLIAM CECIL He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well. \nElizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the handmaidens away. \nELIZABETH Yes, yes, yes. We will send Essex to Ireland and place Robert on my Privy Council. \nBut William's flash of victory is dampened by-- \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I saw a play this last weekend, William. It made me think of... days long past. Of memories... long past. Long past. I should like to see more of them... Has Edward been happy, William? With your daughter? \npg. 46 \nWilliam Cecil doesn't answer. Instead he thinks, remembers, as we hear his younger voice... \nWILLIAM CECIL (O.S.) Murdered! \nCUT TO: \n40   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                           40 \nThirty years earlier. \nWilliam Cecil is standing in front of an enormous fireplace, pacing in a pique of anger. \nWILLIAM CECIL By your own hand! \nYOUNG OXFORD He was stealing my poems. \nWILLIAM CECIL He was doing my bidding! \nYOUNG OXFORD Yours? \nWILLIAM CECIL Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my express-- \nYOUNG OXFORD Robert?   Robert told-- \nWilliam Cecil SLAMS his fists on a table. \nWILLIAM CECIL Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul! \nYOUNG OXFORD My poems are my soul! \nWilliam Cecil turns away in frustration as much as disgust. \nWILLIAM CECIL You have placed me in a grave position, Edward. (MORE) \npg. 47 \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. (beat) But... I wish something in return. \nYoung Oxford looks worried. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters... \nYOUNG OXFORD Sir. For the last three years you have managed to seize much of my inheritance-- \nWILLIAM CECIL Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses. \nYOUNG OXFORD And now you suggest you be \"reimbursed\" the rest of my once considerable estates through your daughter's bed? \nWilliam Cecil studies Young Oxford's face. \nWILLIAM CECIL No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block. \nYOUNG OXFORD \nstares at him.   The SOUND of CHURCH BELLS RINGING takes us to: \n41   INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                41 \nwatches, with a pride he has never felt. \nIN THE GALLERIES \nThe \"wits\" look at each other amazed. \nON STAGE \n\"SALISBURY\" My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed. The French are bravely in their battles set and will with all expedience charge on us. \n\"HENRY V\" All things are ready, if our minds be so. \n\"WESTMORELAND\" Perish the man whose mind is backward now! \npg. 52 \n\"HENRY V\" You know your places: God be with you all! \nTHE \"HUT\" \nwhich is a round tower on top of the stage, contains several small cannons manned by stagehands. They shoot BLANK CANNON SHOTS. \n45   EXT. THE CITY GATES OF LONDON - DAY                           45 \nSouthampton and his retainers gallop through a City gate. Above the gate, the severed heads of murderers sit on pikes. \n46   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   46 \nActors portraying French soldiers STORM the stage, swords brandished. \"Henry\" and his men begin fighting them, their swordplay elaborate and impressive. \n47   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                      47 \nSouthampton and his entourage gallop over London Bridge. \n48   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   48 \nThe battle rages on stage. \nOne hardy audience member starts to actually ATTACK one of the French \"soldiers\" himself. He's quickly joined by a few comrades-- and it quickly becomes a madhouse; half play, half real fight, as more audience members join the \"battle\". The play quickly degenerates into a bloody brawl between actors and audience. \n49   EXT/INT. ROSE THEATER - DAY                                   49 \nSouthampton arrives at the theater.   He jumps   off his horse, and hurries-- \nINTO THE STAIRWELL \njumping two steps at a time. We HEAR the sound of APPLAUSE. The play is now over. Southampton hurries into-- \npg. 53 \nOXFORD'S BOX \nHe sees Oxford, who is applauding.    All the actors of the play are taking their bows. \nSOUTHAMPTON William Cecil's convinced the Queen that only Essex can save Ireland from the Revolt. \nOxford processes this. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) I've pledged to go with him, Edward. We sail in an hour. \nOXFORD Henry-- \nSOUTHAMPTON I ask for your blessing, Edward. \nOXFORD I can't give it to you. \nIN THE GALLERIES \nNASHE I for one wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours. (stands) Playwright! Playwright!! \nMarlowe and others join in.   And-- \nBACKSTAGE \nShakespeare, standing next to a small table of props, quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them stained. He grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries-- \nON STAGE \n--where he bows deeply, loving the adulation. \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nSOUTHAMPTON If he is to be my king, then it is my sacred duty to be with him in battle. \npg. 54 \nOxford tries to understand Southampton, but then notices Shakespeare on stage. His mouth opens in shock, and he turns to look across the theater at-- \nJONSON \nwho guiltily looks away.   Marlowe's mouth is open, his hands stop applauding. \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nSouthampton is angered by Oxford's distraction. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) I am sorry to have disturbed your entertainment. \nAnd he exits. \nOXFORD Henry-- Henry!! \nBut the younger man is gone. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare bows, then-- \nSHAKESPEARE I, I... It's been... I, I, want to... thank my actors, whose great acting brought... my words... to life due to their most finest acting. Ah... Thank you. \nOXFORD (O.S.) An actor?!! \nOXFORD I... don't know. \nSHAKESPEARE (O.S.) \"Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene\" \n53   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    53 \nShakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge-- the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time, it is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost like a mall. \nShakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of \"Romeo and Juliet\" \nSHAKESPEARE \"From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\" (no longer reading) Incredible!! The whole bloody thing in verse?! \nJONSON (nonchalant) It's really not that difficult, if you try. \nSHAKESPEARE And have you ever tried? \nJonson gives him a sharp look, and pauses to pick some onions from a stand. \nShakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples at the next stand. \npg. 59 \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (performing for the Blonde) \"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\" \nThe Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively. \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) (to Jonson) I'll have little trouble parting the legs of barmaids after that performance! \nJONSON You can't play Romeo. \nJonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street. Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after Jonson. \nSHAKESPEARE (to Jonson) Why not? I won't let that oaf Spencer have another go at one of my roles. No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump the life into Romeo's veins. (grins at another passing girl) And his cod piece! (beat, desperate) Ben-- Ben! I'm an actor, every inch of me, down to my very toes... I want- - no, I need, crave-- to act. I can't just idle the day by with-- \nJONSON So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act. \nDISSOLVE TO: \npg. 60 \n54   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  54 \nA performance of \"Romeo and Juliet\". About a dozen actors are dancing. It is Act 1, Scene 5. \"ROMEO\", played by Spencer, is staring longingly at \"Juliet\". \"Romeo\" turns to his servant. \n\"ROMEO\" What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight? \n\"SERVANT\" I know not, sir. \n\"ROMEO\" O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! \nThe actor playing Romeo plays to the women in the audience. And \nTHE WOMEN \nrespond, eye lashes twittering. \nTHE WITS \nWatch in awe!   Now they're all taking swigs of ale. \nBACKSTAGE \nShakespeare mouthing silently the lines of \"Romeo\". \nIN OXFORD'S BOX \nOxford watches the dance carefully. \n\"ROMEO\" (CONT'D) Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n55   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    55 \nTwenty-eight years earlier. A dance is taking place. \nYOUNG OXFORD-- now 20 is dancing with Young Anne.     But his eyes are on: \npg. 61 \nYoung Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish AMBASSADOR. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH \nseems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She STARES intently back at Young Oxford. \nWIDER \nThere is a natural change in the music, and all the dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance. Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish Ambassador goes to Anne. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD \nstare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate moves. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH My lord of Oxford. \nElizabeth smiles. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We liked your play tonight very much. Your young King Henry reminded us of you. \nOXFORD Did he? \nYOUNG ELIZABETH Rash, yet brave. A boy-- and yet a man. Fair on the eyes, fairer to the ear... \nWIDER \nMuch of the Court is watching this.   They can tell there are sparks between them. \nAll the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again finds himself with Elizabeth. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We are glad of your return from the continent. Two years is far too long to be without such excellent amusements. \nShe's only teasing. \nYOUNG OXFORD Ah, but Puck would never fight for you in the Netherlands... \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (surprised, smiles) The Netherlands? \nBut then she realizes he's serious, and the smile vanishes. \nYOUNG OXFORD Well, why not? It's an open secret on the continent that you support the rebels against Spain-- and that you are commissioning Englishmen to help their cause. Spain's loss is England's gain, is it not? \nHer eyes narrow as she studies his face. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH Is this why you bedded me? For a commission? \nYOUNG OXFORD No.   No-- of course not--    I-- \nShe stands, wrapped in her sheets, furious at the thought of once more being used. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH Leave me.    Leave at once! \nA beat. \nYOUNG OXFORD Bess-- \nYOUNG ELIZABETH How dare you! How dare you!! I command you to leave my presence. \npg. 66 \nAnd she steps back, waiting for him to exit. \nYoung Oxford stands... and starts to approach her... He's nude, his back to us. \nShe steps back, a bit stunned by his impertinence.   He steps towards her as-- \nYOUNG OXFORD O Mistress mine, where are you roaming? O stay and hear... your true-love's coming, That can-- (looks up and down her body) --kiss both high and low... \nA bit stunned by his approach, she stumbles backwards on her sheets. \nYOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Trip no further, pretty sweeting.... \nBut he's sexy... and naked. And spouting poetry.     She stops retreating and allows his approach. \nYOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Journeys end in lovers' meeting-- Every wise man's son doth know. \nA small smile escapes her lips. \nYOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter; What's to come is still unsure: \nHe starts to kiss her neck.   Cautiously at first.   But she likes it. \nYOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) In delay there lies no plenty-- Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty, Youth's a stuff will not endure. \nShe responds to him, melting from both his words and touch. They start to kiss deeply, passionately... And- \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (passionately) You will stay in England... And in... my chambers... \npg. 67 \nThe flash of disappointment on Young Oxford's face about that last bit is tempered by Young Elizabeth's sheet falling to the floor. They begin to make love passionately once more. \nNASHE (O.S.) I could do it if I wanted to... \n61   INT. THE MERMAID'S TAVERN - DAY                             61 \nTwenty-seven years later. Jonson, Marlowe, Dekker and Nashe sit silently at a table, mugs of ale in hand. Having just returned from \"Romeo and Juliet\", all are a bit in shock. The actors from the perfomance are there as well in the BG. \nMARLOWE (to Nashe) Do what? \nNASHE (a little drunk) A play in iambic, in iambic pen...in- bic-pentameter. It's not that hard. \nJONSON Think you so? Have you ever tried? \nNASHE Of course not. But I could if I wanted... \nDEKKER It wasn't all in verse. \nNASHE Ha!   See!   Even easier! \nShakespeare enters and makes a bee line for them. \nSHAKESPEARE (excited) Henslowe wants \"Romeo\" to run a fortnight. (unbelievable news) A fortnight! Innkeeper! A round for everybody! Inkeeper!! (no response) Billy!!! \nAnd Shakespeare goes over to the bar. \npg. 68 \nNASHE A fortnight? \nDEKKER The maids love the romantic tragedies. \nMARLOWE Precisely why I avoid them. \nNASHE Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick pony. He'll never be able to do it again. \n62   INT./EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                            62 \nA MONTAGE of various plays: \n\"TWELFTH NIGHT\" \nViola and Sebastian are reunited... \n\"CAESAR\" \nCaesar is attacked by Brutus, Cinna, Cassius, etc... \n\"MACBETH\" \nThe witches are on stage. \nThese three performances are INTER-CUT with: \nMarlowe walks towards the Tower of London. \n68A   INT. TOWER OF LONDON / POLE'S ROOM - DAY                     68A \nSilence....Marlowe is waiting patiently... \nHe is sitting across from Pole, the Captain of the Guard, who is reading his report.... \nPOLE (looks up) Are you certain of this? (almost confused) William Cecil was murdered? \nMARLOWE Not literally, of course. He was a character, a fictional character. But the metaphor was clear for anyone to see. And see, they did. \nPole reads more from the parchment. \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) Will you shut it down? \nPole continues to read. \nPOLE That is not for me to decide... \nHe brings out a pouch of coins, and tosses it across the table. \nPOLE (CONT'D) Your service to his lordship is once again greatly appreciated. \nMarlowe takes the pouch of money. \npg. 73 \nROBERT CECIL (O.S.) He butchered you! \n69   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S STUDY - DAY             69 \nRobert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk. \nWilliam Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill, and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan wheelchair. \nROBERT CECIL Not only in front of Court! But the entire City as well! We must arrest this Shakespeare and- \nWILLIAM CECIL No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly. \nWilliam Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from his chair as-- \nROBERT CECIL But we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks-- \nWILLIAM CECIL (angry) Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is the key to all. \nRobert Cecil looks hurt by his father's anger. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) (gentler) Robert... You must think deeper. You must compensate. Compensate for your... malformations... with the gifts God did grant you... With cunning. With ruthlessness. \nWilliam Ceci pushes a hidden button on the side of his desk-- a spring loaded secret drawer POPS open. Robert Cecil has never seen it before. \nCecil produces a folded piece of parchment from the drawer, offers it to Robert Cecil. \npg. 74 \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) From King James of Scotland. \nRobert Cecil looks surprised. \n69A   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER                 69A \nRobert Cecil is pushing William Cecil in his wheelchair. They are completely alone. \nWILLIAM CECIL James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex... and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. (beat) You will reply to him. \nROBERT CECIL I will reply to him? \nWILLIAM CECIL I am dying, Robert-- (before Robert can protest) We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation. \n69B   INT. CECIL HOUSE - WILLIAM CECIL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS       69B LATER \nRobert Cecil wheels his father in. \nWILLIAM CECIL Help me to my bed, my son. (Robert Cecil does so) If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I. \nA beat as this registers on Robert Cecil. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. (beat) And then tell him Essex will not return from Ireland alive. \npg. 75 \nRobert Cecil looks surprised. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. (beat) But we must do one thing more... \nWilliam Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it. \nWILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D) Like Essex, Edward must be removed. \nROBERT CECIL (confused) Edward? \nWilliam Cecil is slowly falling asleep... \nWILLIAM CECIL He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win... as they always have. \nROBERT CECIL (more confused) I-- I don't understand, father.    What does Edward-- \nWILLIAM CECIL Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose the next King. \nOff Robert Cecil's surprised face we hear: \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.) I am with child... \nCUT TO: \n70   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - LONG GALLERY - DUSK                      70 \nTwenty seven years earlier. Young Elizabeth is pacing, terribly agitated. Bessie, the lady-in-waiting we have seen constantly at her side is the only other person present. \npg. 76 \nJonson is stunned. \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how else could he learn his lines? But the man never actually learned to form his letters. \nJONSON Why are you here, Kit? \nMARLOWE (smiles) So who did write it? You?   No.    You'd take credit for it. No... (MORE) \npg. 80 \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) It must be someone who wants their anonymity protected. Someone who might even pay to have it protected. \nJonson is getting nervous. \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) A nobleman. \nJonson looks up.   Marlowe smiles, knowing he is closer to the truth. \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) But which?    You know, don't you, Ben? \nJONSON You've had too much to drink, Kit. You're beginning to sound like one of your plays. \nJonson stands and hurries out of the Tavern. \n73A   EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON    - MOMENTS LATER                      73A \nJonson heads down the street, Marlowe chasing after him. \nMARLOWE Ben! Tell me. We can go to him together. Guarantee his anonymity... for a price. \nJONSON You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit? Last year. That's why I was arrested, wasn't it? Because you went to the Tower? \nMARLOWE (lying) Ben, Ben... I had nothing to do with that. \nJonson studies Marlowe for a beat and then walks away. \nMARLOWE (CONT'D) Ben-- I'll just go to Will! He'll tell me because he has so much more to lose than you. Fame. Fortune. And you'll profit nothing from it. Nothing! \nBut Jonson is gone. \npg. 81 \n74   EXT. MILITARY CAMP - IRELAND - DAY                         74 \nA military encampment with dozens of tents on a cliff by the Irish seaside. \nCLOSER \nEssex's tent is larger, and guarded. An OLD SERVANT carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches. A guard opens the tent for him to enter. \nINT. ESSEX'S TENT - CONTINUOUS \nEssex is having a Council of War with his generals and senior officers, including Southampton. They all stand around a table, consulting a map of Ireland. \nESSEX (pointing) If the Rebels have stripped the northern borders... Then we must march south... and take Cahir Castle... \nThe SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine into various goblets. Southampton notices him-- the servant's hand shakes as he pours the wine. \nGENERAL (clears throat, uncomfortable) My lord. `Tis a well-defended fortress.    Two thousand men at least. We cannot-- \nSouthampton notices the Servant's shaking hand slipping into a pocket as-- \nESSEX So what would you have me do? Spend the entire spring encamped? I am sent to Ireland to end this infernal rebellion, not idle my days with-- \nSOUTHAMPTON Robert! \nIn an instant Southampton draws a silver engraved pistol and SHOOTS the servant! \nEveryone is shocked-- but then we see: \npg. 82 \nTHE SERVANT \nhad drawn his own, small wooden pistol. \nESSEX \nshares a look with Southampton. \n75   EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                           75 \nTo Establish. A foggy day. In the Foreground we see the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU (20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with rapiers for exercise. \nCLOSER \nThey wear outfits that are slightly more protective than ornamental. \nThey duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES Beaulieu's shoulder. The speak entirely in French. \nBEAULIEU Point! \nOxford backs off, as does the fencing master. \nOXFORD (in French) Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup droit d'autorit\u00e9? \nBEAULIE Mais oui, mon seigneur. \nOXFORD Bien.    En garde! \nAnd they once again begin to duel. But we quickly surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more aggressive than he was before. Oxford realizes it, but is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well. \nAnd then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward, and STABS Oxford in the leg. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Qu'est ce que vous faites? \nBut Oxford has little chance to react, because Beaulieu continues his attack. \npg. 83 \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Beaulieu?    Beaulieu?! \nMAN Release the dogs!   Release the dogs! \nShakespeare shows no reaction. \nJONSON I know he went to see you last night, Will. And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms. \nIN THE PIT \nThe bear baiting begins. \nWIDER \nShakespeare stares at Jonson. \nSHAKESPEARE (dead serious) You're mad, Ben. Kit was my friend. \nJONSON Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done. \nSome of the spectators BOO while others CHEER, and-- \nSHAKESPEARE I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or another, I'll have my guineas. \nAnd he gets up and leaves as the-- \nDOGS \nstart to go for the bear's throat.     Thge cheering goes to a roar as we-- \nCUT TO: \npg. 87 \nSHAKESPEARE \nWears a beard and fake nose. He tries to stay hidden so Jonson doesn't see him. We are: \n78    EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                      78 \nJonson is waiting not far from him by a stand and drinks an ale. \nThen Oxford's servant, Francesco, appears. \nAfter the two men have exchanged couple of words, Francesco gives Jonson a leather folder containing a manuscript and a purse jingling with coin. Jonson takes them and leaves. \nJonson safely gone, Shakespeare starts to follow Francesco who heads back over the bridge. \n78A   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DUSK                                 78A \nShakespeare is in a small boat following Francesco, who is in Oxford's boat. They head towards Oxford Stone. \nEXT.

He holds his wig and his nose. \nA door opens, and Oxford enters, walking on a stick because of his leg injury. He is followed by his servant, Francesco. \nOXFORD So! You are the famous Shakespeare whose labors I have enjoyed so much. I am at your service, sir. \npg. 88 \nShakespeare is uncomfortable. He wasn't expecting Oxford himself. Then he just goes for it. \nSHAKESPEARE My lord-- I- I need more money. \nOXFORD (sharp) I beg your pardon? \nSHAKESPEARE My expenses have, ah, aggrandized... since this all began. \nOXFORD \"Aggrandized\"? \nSHAKESPEARE And if, if your lordship doesn't agree to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall be forced to make certain... facts public. \nFRANCESCO Have you any idea to whom you are speaking? \nSHAKESPEARE I am addressing the writer of Hamlet... of Juliet and her Romeo.   Am I not? \nOxford is silent. Francesco goes to physically eject Shakespeare from the room. \nFRANCESCO Out. Get out! How dare you insult my master in-- \nOXFORD Wait! (beat) How much? \nShakespeare looks at Francesco, then Oxford. \nSHAKESPEARE Four hundred pounds. A year. \nFRANCESCO A year? \nOXFORD Pay him. \npg. 89 \nFrancesco is shocked. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) (impatient, in Italian) Pagalo! \nShakespeare smiles. \n81   EXT.

I will make you as many grandchildren as she can bare... \nWilliam Cecil thinks. \nYOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D) Or I can remain here... \nWilliam Cecil decides. \nWILLIAM CECIL There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the... mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead... \nYOUNG OXFORD The name? \nWILLIAM CECIL Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well. \nYOUNG OXFORD (excited) It's a boy...? \n89   EXT.

A huge crowd of mourners has assembled. \nRobert Cecil steps into place right behind her. \nELIZABETH We wish to recall Essex from Ireland... \nRobert Cecil is instantly concerned, but hides it well. They continue to walk. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) We feel a terrible void, now that your father is no longer at our side... \nRobert Cecil bows his head as he walks. \nROBERT CECIL A wise decision, your majesty. If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors. \nStill walking, she turns to him sharply. \nELIZABETH Rumors? \nROBERT CECIL I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd heard. \nELIZABETH Heard what? \nROBERT CECIL Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain... \nELIZABETH Peace is at hand.

She looks quite ugly. \nShe turns to see Essex, shocked at his intrusion. \nEssex FREEZES.   He knows he has just made an enormous faux-pas. \nESSEX Majesty, I, I... \nShe stares at him, horrified to be seen in such a manner. The she regains her composure and-- \nELIZABETH Get out!   Out!!! \nHe steps back in horror-- not at her appearance, but what he has just done. The doors SLAM in front of him as we-- \nELIZABETH (O.S.) (CONT'D) The insolence! \npg. 101 \n100   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY              100 \nElizabeth, now dressed and wearing her wig on her throne, is raging at Robert Cecil. \nELIZABETH Who in God's name does he think he is? Abandoning his post without my leave! \nShe begins to absent-mindedly unbutton the top of her bodice. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Coming into our presence in such a manner, neither announced nor invited, half his army in my courtyard. He's gone mad... mad! \nROBERT CECIL No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal. \nShe turns to him sharply, furious at the thought. \n101   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                      101 \nIt looks like an armed camp, with part of Essex's army encamped in the front courtyard. The soldiers are all tense. \nOxford, followed only by Francesco, rides into the courtyard. He is immediately surrounded by armed men, their muskets pointed at him. Oxford raises his hands. \nOXFORD I am Edward, Earl of Oxford. \nSOUTHAMPTON Edward!   Edward! Thank god you're here. \nSouthampton comes towards him. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal licenses! She believes every lie Cecil tells about him. (seeing Oxford's wound) Edward? What happened to your leg? \npg. 102 \nOXFORD (shrugs) Nothing. \nOxford continues towards the door. Southampton follows, his concern for Oxford's wound noticeable. \n102   INT. ESSEX HOUSE - HALL - DAY                                102 \nOxford, Southampton and Essex are alone. Oxford is sitting in a chair, while Essex paces impatiently, Southampton standing between them. \nESSEX She won't accept my letters. I cannot get to her. Cecil plans to arrest me any day. I know it. (beat and more determined) But that won't be as easy as he thinks. \nOXFORD Fight him in London, and you only validate every rumor and lie Cecil has ever told about you. \nESSEX Then what do you suggest I do? Let myself be arrested so I can be tried and executed for crimes I did not commit? \nOXFORD No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself, alone-- \nESSEX How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first. \nOXFORD I won't send her a letter.   I will send her a book. \nEssex looks confused, but Oxford ignores it. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) She will call for me. And while I am with her, you will come-- not with an army, not with swords, but with her loyal subjects. The cobblers, the tinkers, the bricklayers of London. (MORE) \npg. 103 \nOXFORD (CONT'D) All, all calling for Robert Cecil's banishment from Court. Words, Robert, words, will prevail with her, not swords. \nRobert Cecil walks down the long hall, heading for an audience with the queen. Two guards open a door, letting him into-- \n109   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DUSK         109 \nElizabeth is looking out the window. It's raining outside. She is NOT wearing her wig, not much make-up, and looks quite... odd. \nRobert Cecil enters. \nELIZABETH (turns) You find me disgusting, don't you? Repugnant. Wrinkled? \nROBERT CECIL You, you are the sun, majesty.   The glory of-- \nELIZABETH Liar! \nRobert Cecil shuts his mouth. \npg. 107 \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Is it so hard to believe that once I was young? That I was... beautiful? Your father knew me as such... (beat) You have read the book? \nShe doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a copy of \"Venus and Adonis\" on a table. He NODS. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) He writes to me. To remind me of that beauty. That love. How I... took him. How I... adored him... \nRobert Cecil knows to be silent.   She looks out the window. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (throaty, sexually) Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry, Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie... \nShe smiles seductively, transported in time. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I've been foolish. Proud. Yes. Too proud. Gloriana... The Virgin Queen... A statue. Bloodless. (beat) \"Thou wast begot; to beget is thy duty. By law of nature thou art bound to breed, That thine may live when thou thyself art dead\"... (beat) Your father told you of the child? \nA beat. \nROBERT CECIL (hint of a smile) Which one, your majesty? \nElizabeth's eyes flare in anger for an instant, then she regains composure. \nELIZABETH His.   Mine.   He still lives? \nRobert Cecil nods. \npg. 108 \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) He was well placed? A nobleman? \nROBERT CECIL (hesitates) Yes... your majesty. \nELIZABETH Who? \nRobert Cecil hesitates. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I am your Queen! Now who is my son!!? \nROBERT CECIL His grace, the Earl of... Southampton, your majesty. \nShe seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex. But then she smiles, and NODS in approval. \nCECIL Majesty... You are not having doubts about James of Scotland succeeding you, are you? \nElizabeth goes into a rage. \nELIZABETH James?! He is the son of Mary! She plotted and schemed to steal the throne from under me! No son of hers will rule while a yet Tudor lives! \nRobert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I will decide what is best for my kingdom! Not you! Not you!! (calmer) I have bid Edward to come to me on my return to London on Monday next. It is decided. \nShe says no more, the audience over. Robert Cecil hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and exits, the fury on his face plain. \nElizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window... \npg. 109 \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (sotto) And so, in spite of death, I shall survive, In that, my likeness still is left alive. \nCUT TO: \n110    EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY                                   110 \nBen Jonson walks with a manuscript in his hands. He stops for a moment when he sees the new Globe theater. Workers are still painting the walls. \nHe pauses when he sees a poster in front advertising a performance of \"Richard III\" on Monday next. \n110A   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                              110A \nJonson sticks his head in and takes in the glorious new theater Shakespeare and Burbage have built. \nThe actor Condell is on stage, rehearsing the character of \"Gloucester\". He walks on stage with a limp, and has a large hump on his back. He is a caricature of Robert Cecil. \n\"GLOUCESTER\" (in character) But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking-glass... \nRichard BURBAGE, the theater's stage manager, is watching his performance with Spencer and a group of actors. \nJonson stops and watches the rehearsal for a beat. \n\"GLOUCESTER\" (CONT'D) (in character) I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world... \nSPENCER Good part, that... \npg. 110 \n\"GLOUCESTER\" ...and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. (out of character) Is this wise? \nBURBAGE It's only the one performance.   Go on! \n\"GLOUCESTER\" I need a drink... \nAnd \"Gloucester\" heads backstage. \nJONSON (to Burbage) Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful! The best Bankside! But only one performance? Is it that bad? \nBURBAGE We have to turn `em away by the hundreds! Look! Never seen anything quite like it! \nAnd both men look out the curtains to the crowd outside. \nThe theater is full to the last seat. The people are crammed together like sardines. \n118A    INT.

THE GLOBE THEATER - THE GALLERIES - DAY             118AA \nJonson is leaning against the edge of the balustrade, watching the Groundlings fill in. He bites his nails nervous. \nNashe joins him as-- \nNASHE So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for this whole performance! Man's never even been to the theater, and still he's heard of Will-- \nDekker also joins them. \nDEKKER Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in weeks. They're all just sitting there, waiting. \nJONSON Waiting?     Waiting for what? \nDEKKER Wants to have an audience with the Queen. As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her now. \nNASHE By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out! Who can keep up with it all!? (takes a swig) (MORE) pg. 115 \nNASHE (CONT'D) Zounds, I tire of politics, politics, politics. \n119   EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAY                                   119 \nOxford is in a long-boat, headed for Whitehall Palace. The oars of the boat cut neatly and silently into the water. \n120   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY         120 \nElizabeth is doing her toilette. She seems excited like a school girl before her first date. Her Ladies in waiting are attending to her. \n121   INT. THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY                                  121 \nThe audience HUSHES as-- \nON STAGE \n\"GLOUCESTER\", the future Richard III, enters. He is hunch-backed, and looks as much like Robert Cecil as possible in terms of beard and costume. First the people are in stunned silence, but then like magic the hissing starts. It is followed by more hissing and the first boos. \nThe actor playing Gloucester nervously looks around... \nIN THE GALLERIES \nDekker seems surprised at the similarity to Robert Cecil. \nDEKKER (to Nashe) Tired of politics are you? Seems you picked the wrong day to come to the theater, then... \nJonson gives Dekker a sharp look.   What's going on here? \nON STAGE \n\"Gloucester\" addresses the audience. \n\"GLOUCESTER\" Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York. Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.... \npg. 116 \nThe hissing and booing has swelled so strong that the actor stops for a moment. But then he finds the courage again to continue. \nJonson looks down at the Groundling's reaction, and spots-- \nFRANCESCO \nin the audience. But among the Groundlings, not in Oxford's usual box seat. \nJONSON \nlooks over to Oxford's box.   It's empty. \n\"GLOUCESTER\" ...and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries, he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking- glass... \n122   OMIT                                                           122 \n123   INT.

BANKSIDE - IN FRONT OF THE GLOBE THEATER - DAY            124 \nThe huge crowd has stayed in front of the Globe. It seems they are waiting for something. We hear hissing and booing from the crowd inside the theater. \n\"GLOUCESTER\" ...and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them. \npg. 117 \n125   INT.

Their sixty or so men behind them ready for the march to Elizabeth. \nESSEX Edward knows what he is doing...      Does he not? \nSOUTHAMPTON He promised us a mob. They'll be here. \nEssex looks concerned, but says no more. \nAnd she leaves him with that. \n147   EXT. THE TOWER OF LONDON - COURTYARD - DAY                   147 \nEssex-- dressed in black, but with a bright red waistcoat-- is led up a scaffold by guards, his hands bound behind him. \nSnow covers the courtyard. There are only a few witnesses, as befitting Essex's rank. \nESSEX \nstands, looking at life one last time. The Executioner approaches with an axe. Essex turns, realizing it is time. \nESSEX Strike true. \nHe kneels, resting his head on a wooden bench. \npg. 128 \nESSEX (CONT'D) God save the Queen! \nAnd BAM!   Just as the axe lands we-- \nCUT TO: \nFROM A WINDOW \nwe see the body of Essex fall onto the scaffolding, his head into a basket. We are: \n148   INT.

WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY                 149 \nDoors fly open and Oxford appears before Elizabeth, who is on her throne, regal and all in white, surrounded by courtiers, including Robert Cecil. But she looks very old, very ill. \nEveryone goes silent as Oxford approaches Elizabeth. Oxford makes no notice of them. He bows deeply in front of her. \nELIZABETH Leave us.    All of you. \nPeople start to exit.     But not Robert Cecil. \nROBERT CECIL Majesty, I-- \nELIZABETH Leave us! \nCecil exits, obviously worried.       When they are alone: \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) You look old... \nOxford smiles sadly. \npg. 129 \nOXFORD I thank your majesty for seeing me. \nELIZABETH You cannot have him. \nOXFORD He is our son. \nELIZABETH Who did commit High Treason! \nOXFORD They only wished for a place in government equal to their station. Equal to their birth. \nELIZABETH You caused this! Your play, your words, caused my people to mob against me! Do you think I wasn't aware of your plot with this man Shakespeare, that I wouldn't recognize your voice? It should be your head on the block next week, not Southampton's! \nOxford kneels. \nOXFORD Then take my head. In our son's stead. \nElizabeth turns away from him, angered.   She walks to a window, turns her back on him. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Neither they nor I ever conspired against you. Cecil alone was our aim. He has corrupted your-- \nELIZABETH Cecil?  He has kept me my throne! (beat) Mary, Queen of Scots... Philip, King of Spain... Four French Louis's... Eight Popes-- they all wanted my head. My throne. All of them! (beat) Yet here I remain... Because of the Cecils. \nOXFORD We would have protected you-- \npg. 130 \nELIZABETH You would have protected me? You? My \"loyal\" Earls? (snarls) You think Essex and Southampton were the first to conspire against me, to try to take my throne? No! (beat) Only the Cecils could I trust! Commoners! They could never claim my throne. Never! Their wealth, their power, their survival, all depended on me. Me and no other! \nA long beat before-- \nOXFORD Let our child live... \nELIZABETH (furious) All Englishmen are my children! \nShe has a coughing fit. Oxford patiently waits until she has recovered. Finally... \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Does he know? \nOxford shakes his head. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) And if I give him to you? \nOXFORD He will never learn of it from me. \nShe pauses for a long moment...    And then she decides. \nELIZABETH He must never know... Never. (beat) Take him. \nOxford dares to smile, relieved. \nOXFORD But only after my death! Only then! When all is complete. After James is crowned king, his crown safe, only then can you claim your son... our son. (beat) This Island will be whole. (MORE) pg. 131 \n", "test1_input": "laughing.

Well? \nTWO MEN \nwalk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes have seen better days. \nHis companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON (22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and extremely enthusiastic. \nSOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Wonderful, isn't it? \nOXFORD (frowning slightly) Well, it's certainly... big. \npg. 9 \nSOUTHAMPTON I promise you, Edward, you've seen nothing like it before! Nothing! \nOXFORD Bricklayers and whores watching Aristophones?   You're quite right, Henry, not only have I never witnessed it, I'm not sure I care to. \nSOUTHAMPTON (teasing) You're an elitist, you know that, Edward? \nOxford pauses at the entrance. \nOXFORD There won't be puppets, will there? \nSouthampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER, who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay outside) inside. \nUSHER My lords... \nINT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS \nThe usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford observes everything as they walk. \nSOUTHAMPTON The stage-craft is quite spectacular. Far more elaborate than anything I've seen at court. I've witnessed be- headings that god as my witness look as real as at the Tower, cannons fired in battle... \nThey come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much like a match-stick girl. \nSELLING-MAID Ale?   Mutton, mi' lord? \nSouthampton waves her off as they follow the usher up another flight of stairs. \npg. 10 \nSOUTHAMPTON ...and last week, they had some sort of a device to hoist cherubs into the air and fly over the entire audience! \nOXFORD An ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s. Deus ex machina. Machine of the Gods. \nAnd as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches glimpses of the stage and performance through the rafters and over the heads of the attending audience. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes into a situation from which they couldn't write their way out-- \nOxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost despite himself. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) --Out came the ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s... As when Hippolytus is saved by Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens... Always good for an ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s was Euripides \nOxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton. \nThey come to the third floor and enter the box seating area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and sees- \nFROM OXFORD'S POV \nAudience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids SELLING food-- the actors ACTING... \nIt's alive.   Magical. \nBACK TO OXFORD \nOxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it. \nON-STAGE \nThe actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner. He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly. \nAnother actor SPENCER (30) plays \"FASTIDIOUS\"; a pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman. \npg. 11 \nHe wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays \"Sogliardo\" \nSHAKESPEARE And whither were you riding now, signior? \n\"FASTIDIOUS\" Who, I? What a silly jest's that! Whither should I ride but to the court? \n", "test1_true": "The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks below at a buxom young lady among the \"groundlings\". He smiles seductively. She smiles back. \nBACKSTAGE \nJonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking the lines with the actors. \nIN THE RAISED SEATING \nA group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an air of judgement. They are: Christopher \"Kit\" MARLOWE (32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered a bit of a hack by his colleagues. \nThey are called the \"Mermaid's Wits\" because they frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern. \nNASHE (takes a swig of ale) His second play, and almost a full house. (burps) He's got a wit, does Jonson. \nMARLOWE That might be so, but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find it, and when you have it, it's not worth the search! \npg. 12 \nThe others smile as a WOMAN passes. \nWOMAN Ale!   Ale!! \nDEKKER Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will you? Henslowe still owes me for \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". \nMARLOWE (retrieving coins) That would be because no one saw \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". \nDEKKER Ale here! \nMarlowe gives the woman a few pennies as-- \nNASHE Kit... Isn't that one of your unrequited loves in the box over there? \nMarlowe glances across the theater and spots Southampton siting next to Oxford. \nMARLOWE (frowns) But with whom? Tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as that! \nNashe squints. \nNASHE I think-- yes, by the beard, that's the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker used to play for him. Had his own acting troupe for private Court performances and the like. \nDEKKER I wonder if he needs any material? \nMARLOWE Certainly not any of yours. \nNASHE No, no-- that was years ago. Had a falling out with the Queen, I heard. He's more of a recluse than a patron these days. \npg. 13 \nON STAGE \nShakespeare points to \"Fastidious\". \nSHAKESPEARE Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the earth; man, he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub! \nShakespeare struts around as though he owned the place. The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in laughter. \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) He sleeps with a musk-cat every night, and walks all day hang'd in perfumed chains for penance. \nA GROUNDLING Oi!   So that's what I been smelling! \nMore groundlings laugh.     Interestingly-- \nNOBLEMEN \nin the box seats do not. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to the groundlings. \nSHAKESPEARE He has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly, the poor man's brain is lighter than his feather... \nAs the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see: \nA NOBLEMAN \nwith a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him as he goes. \nON STAGE \nShakespeare smiles triumphantly. \npg. 14 \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) He is a good and empty puff, but he loves you well, signior. I wish you well with him. \nOXFORD \nWatches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass by. \nBACKSTAGE \nLater in the play... \nShakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson, and grabs him. \nSHAKESPEARE (CONT'D) Jonson! Wonderful dialogue! Wonderful. I hope your next-- \nHENSLOWE (O.C.) Will!   Will Shakespeare! \nShakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE (50'S) heading his way. \nHENSLOWE (CONT'D) That's not ale in that goblet is it? \nShakespeare hides the goblet behind his back. \nSHAKESPEARE Ale? Me? Drink during a performance? I am a professional sir! (burps) A complete and-- \nHe is interrupted by SCREAMS.

And-- \nGUARDS ARMED WITH MUSKETS \nline up in a colonnade in the story above.      Pole is in command. \nPOLE Take your aim! \nSOUTHAMPTON \nrealizes-- \npg. 123 \nSOUTHAMPTON It's a trap! \nESSEX Spread out! \nBut before his men can obey-- \nIN THE COLONNADE \nPole orders-- \nPOLE Fire!! \nIN THE COURTYARD \n", "test2_true": "141    INT.

You must away! Essex is in armed revolt! He's come to usurp you! \nELIZABETH (confused) Essex? I-- Edward is-- \nShe seems like a confused old woman. \npg. 124 \nROBERT CECIL You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He means to kill you and take your throne for himself! \nIt takes only an instant for that to sink in. She looks enraged. And then she turns with a flurry, and heads back the way she came. The guards that were with Robert Cecil follow her. \n143   EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                     143 \nAnother fusillade is SHOT, and more of Essex's men go down. \nAnd then doors OPEN on the ground floor, and guards RUSH out to take down the survivors. \nEssex and Southampton valiantly fight, but there's just too many. \nThey're soon surrounded... And Essex, knowing all is lost, raises his sword in defeat. \nSouthampton sees this, and does the same. \n144   INT.

She won't forgive him this, Edward. \nOxford turns, devastated. \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) Essex will be convicted and executed for treason. (beat) As will your son. \nOxford looks shocked. \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) (smiles) What? Didn't you think I knew? Of course I knew, Edward. My father told me all his secrets. All of them. (smiling) Though the most fascinating was not made known to me until after his death. (MORE) pg. 125 \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) He hated you, Edward, how he hated you. And yet he married his only daughter to you. I never knew why, until I read his last letter to me. \nOXFORD He wanted his grandson to be an Earl. \nROBERT CECIL No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to be a king. \nOxford now looks confused. \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) Elizabeth had several children, Edward, not just yours. She was sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary was still Queen, and our future Gloriana was out of favor. No one thought her very important at all. Except my father, of course. And when her first child was born, a male, my father took it, and hid it. The grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman. John De Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task. \nOxford goes ashen. \nOXFORD You lie... \nROBERT CECIL Do I? (beat) Why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died? He had it all planned years in advance. He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry his daughter, and, after Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir. His own grandchild to follow you on the throne. But he couldn't possibly predict what kind of failure you would become. How you would fail in politics, ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy, all to write... (sneers) Poetry. (beat) Or that you would commit incest. (MORE) pg. 126 \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) (beat) Delicious isn't it? Right out of a Greek tragedy. \nOXFORD Elizabeth would never have-- \nROBERT CECIL What?  Slept with her son? (beat) I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth. Though you never know with the Tudors. They all have had such strange tastes in bed-fellows. (beat) You could have been a king, Edward. And your son after you. Except for the fact that... you were you. \n145    EXT. WHITEHALL PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                     145 \nIt's raining, hard. \nOxford almost stumbles out of the building onto the now empty courtyard. The remains of the battle are still visible. Wounded, screaming horses struggle to stand... \nOxford's a shell-- devoid of emotion. Broken. Hardly alive at all.

Robert Cecil doesn't turn or acknowledge Pole, but speaks to him as he stares at Oxford. \nROBERT CECIL I want a fair trial for Southampton... Evidence, witnesses, no false confessions. It must be above reproach. Though with a guilty verdict of course. Oh, and Pole-- (turns) If there is any mention of that play-- (looks back at Oxford) (MORE) pg. 127 \nROBERT CECIL (CONT'D) --Make certain the secretaries refer to it as Richard the Second.

When Jonson sits down he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the bed. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Did you know, Jonson, that my family can trace its peerage farther back than any family in the kingdom?   We fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field. At Agincourt. (beat) I inherited my Earldom as one of the wealthiest men ever to breathe English air... and at last breath, I shall be one of the poorest. \nJonson looks on sadly. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Never a voice in government. Never a sword raised in glorious battle. No immortal deeds for my heirs to know me by. (beat) Words, merely words, are to be my legacy... (beat) You alone watch my plays and know them as mine. When I hear the applause, the cheering, of the audience, all those hands clapping, they are celebrating... another man. But in that cacophony of sounds, I strained to hear the sound of two hands only. Yours. (beat) But heard them, I never did. \nJonson stares at him. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) Death takes away all pretense and demands honesty from its target. You, you have never told me... never told me what you thought of my work... \nTo answer is not an easy task for Jonson's ego.    He hesitates. \npg. 136 \nJONSON (almost a whisper) I find... your words... the most wondrous ever heard on our stage.    On any stage... Ever. \nThe two men now looking each other in the eye. \nJONSON (CONT'D) (sotto) You are the soul of the age... \nOxford smiles at the thought of it.   Then-- \nOXFORD Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that you will keep our secret safe. That you won't expose Shakespeare... \nJONSON My lord? \nOXFORD I have seen it in your face... He vexes you. How could he not? But he is not your burden. He is mine. \nThen he nods to the manuscripts by his side. \nOXFORD (CONT'D) All my writings. The plays, the sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them from my family. From the Cecil's. Wait a few years, and then, publish them. \nJonson looks stricken. \nJONSON I am not worthy of this charge, my lord. I... I betrayed you...

The manuscripts are under his arm. \nAnne, Oxford's wife is still there, surround by doctors. \nThen she sees Jonson leaving. \nANNE Get out! You, your friends, your blasphemous theaters, have brought nothing but ruin and dishonor to this family. \nJONSON Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper. \nHe turns and exits. \nCUT TO: \n159   EXT.

To the Earl of Southampton. The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. \nJonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house, realizing there is another whole layer to all this; exactly what he can only guess. \nCUT TO: \npg. 138 \n", "test3_true": "A few hours later.

Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear, whispers: \nCECIL I can make all this go away, Jonson... To be but a dream. Like one of your plays... Or, I can bring you so much pain-- pain that were you given a thousand years, and a thousand quills, you could never justly describe... \nCecil steps back. \npg. 139 \nCECIL (CONT'D) I know you have them.

Why would I lie? Is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than I? \nJonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking about Cecil as well as himself. \nJONSON (CONT'D) He was something I could never be. An undeniable perfection... that plagued my soul... And to him I was... nothing. A messenger. Nothing more. \nCecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching for the truth.

For you. And for me. \nRobert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at him.

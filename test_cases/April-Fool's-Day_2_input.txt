The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island ­ Clara -- to disembark. Clara passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking her head in sad appraisal. FERRYMAN (cont.) (GROWLS) Ok, let's go. 
It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s. 
FERRYMAN (cont.) To the rear. Outa the operator's way. 
Nikki clutches at Skip's arm. 
NIKKI (IN MOCK-TERROR) This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better? 
ARCH (BEHIND HER) Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole. 
NIKKI (SUGGESTIVE ) You could tie me in chains... 
Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant. 
CHAZ (a low whisper) Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out... 
The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed, of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks and moves on. 
BUCK Sh -i-i-t... 
Kit is hanging back on the dock. 
FERRYMAN Come on if you're coming. 
KIT (URGENTLY) Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody -- 
FERRYMAN (GRUFFLY) It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime. KIT But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this... 
Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them. 
PARKING LOT - THEIR POV A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief. Rob comes hurrying up the ramp. 
ANGLE ­ LANDING ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR. 
HARVEY Wait up! 
Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce Springsteen badge. 
ROB (to Kit, kissing her) Sorry... Nik, Chaz... (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know) Rob Ferris... 
They return greetings. 
HARVEY (RIGHT BEHIND ) Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot. 
Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him. 
CHAZ You're friends with... Muffy St. John? 
HARVEY (PROUDLY) Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves. 
NIKKI I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting. 
SKIP (an ironical nod) Harve. 
HARVEY (correcting him, blithely) Hal... (noticing interest his badge) Springsteen, he's still the Boss! 
FERRYMAN (IMPATIENTLY) Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day. 
He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes. 
HARVEY (enthusiastically, putting down his fear) YOU all buddies? 
NIKKI Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met. 
KIT (AMIABLY) But we will be. 
CHAZ (MEANING SKIP) Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin. 
HARVEY (tickled, to Skip) No kiddin'? 
SKIP Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited... (frowns, tellingly) Old money never mixes family with friends. 
NIKKI This is true. For as long as I've known her. 
KIT (JOKING) To protect her family, I guess. SKIP (UNSMILING) To keep her friends. 
He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens into the lens.

TOM I don't know if I do honestly. 
SUMMER I understand. 
TOM Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy. 
SUMMER You really do? 
TOM (BEAT) God no. 
They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate. 
SUMMER How are you, Tom? 
TOM I'm good. Ish. 
SUMMER That's good. 
TOM Yeah I quit the office. 
SUMMER Really? That's great! What are you doing now? 
TOM Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things. 
Awkward silence. 
TOM So who's the guy? 
SUMMER Who, my guy? 
TOM Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know. 
SUMMER Tom... 
TOM No really, I don't. 
SUMMER Ok. 
More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And THEN: 
TOM It's amazing to me. You're married. 
SUMMER I know. 
TOM You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife! 
SUMMER Pretty crazy, huh? 
TOM (SIGHS) I'll never understand that. 
SUMMER Tom -- 
TOM What's different now? How could things change so quickly? 
SUMMER I don't know. It just happened. 
TOM What happened?! That's what I don't get. 
SUMMER I... Tom... 
TOM What, tell me... 
SUMMER I woke up one day and I knew. 
Tom says nothing. 
SUMMER I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you. 
And there's not much else to say after that. 
Tom gets up to leave. 
TOM You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit. 
SUMMER What is? 
TOM Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God! 
SUMMER Tom, don't go. 
TOM I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along.

73   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY               73 
Rose hands Winston a canister of Fancy Corn and a business card. Rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a style of a child's drawing. It reads, "Sunshine Cleaning." 
WINSTON Sunshine Cleaning. Nice. 
ROSE Thought we'd put a positive spin on things. My son drew the design.

Oscar stares at Winston's empty sleeve. 
WINSTON That's a nice job you did there. 
OSCAR Where's your arm? 
ROSE Oscar! 
WINSTON That's all right. 
ROSE I was thinking maybe I could set a few out by the register? 
WINSTON Yeah sure. 
Rose hands Winston a stack of cards. He places them in an owl business card holder in front of several Clean Sweep business cards. 
WINSTON This is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves. 
Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should turn it off. He does. 
ROSE 
So, marketing? Like...? 
WINSTON Funeral Homes, property managers... What you really want is to get in with the insurance companies. They can throw you a ton of work. 
Oscar walks into the back room. 
74   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY                              74 
The room is jammed with model planes, cars and boats in various stages of construction. A hobbyist's fantasy land.

Oscar's mouth drops open. 
75   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                      75 
Winston puffs up a bit with `manly know how'. 
WINSTON Do you guys have your B.B.P. certification? 
ROSE B.B. who? 
Winston smiles. 
WINSTON Blood Born Pathogens. The big money jobs... they'll expect you to be certified. I can register you for the next seminar if you want. 
76   EXT. LAWSON'S USED CAR LOT - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                     76 
Rose, Norah, Oscar and Joe follow SHERM LAWSON across the car lot. Rose shoots an irritated look to her dad. 
ROSE (whispering to Norah) Did you ask him to come. 
NORAH Not exactly. 
Joe positions himself next to Rose. 
JOE (Quietly to Rose) Now Sherm's gonna say he's against the wall but don't you believe him. There's always some wiggle room. 
ROSE I can handle it. 
The troop comes to a stop in front of a large blue van. 
SHERM I think you're gonna like this Econoline.

Sherm opens the back doors. Rose, Joe and Sherm stick their heads inside. Rose nods. 
JOE The girls have started up their own specialized cleaning business. Crime scene and trauma clean-up. 
ROSE It's a real growth industry. 
SHERM Sounds kinda gory.

ROSE Can be. Can be. 
Rose surveys the interior space. 
ROSE We gotta take any contaminated materials to the incinerators. So we'll need lots of space back here. 
OSCAR For the bloody stuff.

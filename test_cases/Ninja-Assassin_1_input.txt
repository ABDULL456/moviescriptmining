(CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   91. 117   CONTINUED:                                                   117 
Waiting for Raizo to tire, waiting for an opening. 
118   EXT. ORPHANAGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT                             118 
A portion of the Orphanage's wall burns through.        Mika spots Raizo through the flames. 
She runs for him. 
119   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT               119 
Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam and Ozunu has his opening- 
His assault is ferocious. 
Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out. 
Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or deflecting the whirlwind attack until-- 
One sound cuts through the furious fight. 
Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as-- 
The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place. 
MIKA Die you fuck! 
She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him. 
OZUNU Bitch! 
A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor. But the distraction gives Raizo his chance. 
The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu. 
Rage thunders the hall. 
Mika gets back up and aims but-- 
Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears. 
MIKA Raizo

She cannot see him. 
Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst, his blade shatters through Raizo's chain-- 
Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his chest. 
Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces. 
RAIZO Mika! Run! 
MIKA Where is he?   I can't see him! 
RAIZO Get away! 
Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull. 
She spins around but is too late. 
The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as- 
Raizo finds them. 
He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls-- 
His pain a force of nature unleashed. 
The chain blades crackle in the air- 
Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which- 
Finally shatters against Raizo's fury. 
And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched rag doll. 
Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and-- 
--hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door.

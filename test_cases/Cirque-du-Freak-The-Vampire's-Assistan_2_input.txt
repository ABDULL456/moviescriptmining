DARREN Shut up, Steve. 
Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks. Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over. Knocked in a heap. Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's pretty powerful himself. Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings his fist in a vicious arc. Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head. Murlough's getting tired of Darren. 
MURLOUGH You need to stand still so you can die. But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't. He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain. Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with Crepsley hanging onto the end of it. 
FACTORY SPACE The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage. 
UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY Crepsley brings up his knife. Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand. With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat. But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART! Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at Crepsley whose throat he still holds. Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back, falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking Crepsley with him. 
FACTORY SPACE SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead. As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them. 
UPPER FLOOR But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie, pushes her to the edge where the rafters are. 
STEVE Stay back! Or I'll throw her off! I mean it! It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie. She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS. Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice. But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter. Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor. Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them: rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale. 
DARREN It's over, Steve. 
STEVE Is it? Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will be their last. They separate, try to gain position. 
STEVE You wanna hear something funny? After your funeral, I went to see your parents. They continue circling. 
STEVE And they were fine. They acted like they barely remembered you. 
DARREN Liar. 
Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling. 
STEVE 
(SMILES) And your sister. She was moving into your room. They had a yard sale. I bought some of your stuff. Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly: 
DARREN Did you steal money from my mom's purse? 
STEVE What? 
DARREN Did you? Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious. 
STEVE Why do you ask? Is knowing that gonna help you rest in peace? 
DARREN No. It's just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was I was arguing with him. 
STEVE 
(FLIP) Least you had a dad to argue with. A fury building in Darren. 
DARREN I was telling him he was wrong about you. That's the last time we had together. Fighting about you. 
STEVE Hate to tell ya. Your dad was right. How do you think we got the money for the dumb tickets? I took it. Just like I'm gonna take you. Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up, no matter how many times Steve hits him. 
WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it. 
DARREN I miss him. 
WHAM! 
DARREN Do you understand? 
WHAM! 
DARREN I miss him so much. WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over. But just as he pitches off the end rafter... Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will fall into the spikes below. Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do. 
CREPSLEY Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you won't have to do it later. Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever. 
DARREN

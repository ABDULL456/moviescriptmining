CHRIS It could be the leather pants. 
TAYA Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone? 
CHRIS Corduroy. 
She takes him in. Loose sweatshirt, no hair gel. 
TAYA Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers? 
CHRIS Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth. 
TAYA That's great. A real red-neck. 
CHRIS I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan. 
TAYA What's the difference? 
CHRIS We ride horses, they ride their cousins. 
TAYA (almost laughs) What do you do for work? You look like military. 
CHRIS I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates. 
TAYA Do I look stupid to you? 
CHRIS To be honest, you look a little sad. 
She's taken aback by his observation. 
CHRIS So am I tall enough to buy you a drink? 
TAYA Not until you tell me what you do. 
CHRIS How about this: one shot, one answer. 
Chris passes her a shot. She throws it back, fierce. 
TAYA You're obviously military. What branch? 
CHRIS I'm just finishing BUD/S. 
TAYA Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL? 
CHRIS That was two questions... 
TAYA (two angry shots) I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL. 
CHRIS What's that mean you know all about us? 
TAYA You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. (pushes him a shot) I'd never date a SEAL. 
CHRIS (confused) How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country. 
TAYA Why? 
CHRIS Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. (climbs off stool) I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you. 
TAYA Where are you going? 
CHRIS You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home. 
TAYA I said I'd never marry one. 
It's a lie and they both know it. 
CHRIS Well in that case... what's your name? 
TAYA Taya. 
CHRIS Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle. 
TAYA (liquor softening her) Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris? 
CHRIS Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women. 
TAYA Sounds like you're under attack. 
She levels a look and downs another shot-- 
30   EXT. MULRONEY'S BAR, PARKING LOT - LATER                    30 
Mist rolls in. Chris holds Taya's hair as she pukes. She takes a deep breath, wipes her mouth-- 
TAYA --I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it. 
She smiles, then turns to puke again-- 
31   EXT. RANGE - "SNIPER SCHOOL" - CAMP BILLY MACHEN - DAY      31 
An arid range with human-shaped targets. PETTY OFFICER TOSH (Irish/Japanese, nasty) walks past prone students. 
PO TOSH Feel breath filling every cell of your body. This is our ritual. We master our breath, we master our mind--- 
FIND CHRIS on .300 Win-Mag. Both eyes open. Dip packed. Deep breaths. His finger taking up the trigger-slack. 
PO TOSH --pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort. You will be aware of it but not directing it. And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heart-beats.

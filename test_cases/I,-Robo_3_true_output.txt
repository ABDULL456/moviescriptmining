Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand. 
The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but... Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The Robot's foot...breaks up the concrete... 
The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him up...shoving him...against the wall...about to CRUSH him when... 
Spooner...kicks out its knees...the Robot...SMASHING into the wall...then bounces back...trying...to pin Spooner...back... 
Man and machine...struggling...Spooner...losing his footing...falling...The Maintenance Robot...LOOMING over him... 
Spooner's HAND...whips back...grabbing his back-up WEAPON...squeezing off some SHOTS...into the Robot's arm...it breaks off... 
Spooner...scrambling back...continues FIRING...the Robot...jerking back...a macabre dance...until Spooner...runs out of bullets... 
The Robot...recovers...grabbing the gun from Spooner's hand...pistol-whipping him...then picking him up and... 
HURLING him against the wall...Spooner...watching as FLUID...GUSHES from the Robot's body...the Robot...taking a swing at him which Spooner... 
BLOCKS...with his right arm...the Robot...ready...to try again...but STALLING...having lost...too much fluid...it TOPPLES...to the ground... 
Spooner. Exhausted. Beaten to a pulp. His knees, starting to buckle. As he thinks he sees. In the DISTANCE... 
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards them... 
Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it closes in on him... 
SPOONER Noooo! 
WE FADE... 
85   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          85 
To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND.       As we slowly. FADE IN ON... 
SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head. Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish. 
His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open.      His brow. Furrowing. At the whirring sound. As he tries.     To figure out. Where he is. Looks down to see... 
A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES. Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised RIBCAGE... 
SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS.         ARE CLAMPED to the bed. One of the ROBOTS. Turns to him. 
MEDICAL ROBOT 1 Stay still. 
Spooner.   Desperately twisting, struggling... 
SPOONER What are you doing! 
Looking around.   COMPUTER MONITORS.   Everywhere... 
SPOONER What are you doing!? 
JUST THEN. Another ROBOT.   Enters the room.     Holding a medical plasma sheet. 
MEDICAL ROBOT 2 Detective Del Spooner. You have suffered significant trauma to the head and chest... 
86   EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   86 
Lt. Bergin. Standing outside Spooner's hospital room. Turns and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed... 
SPOONER I want to talk to a human being! 
87   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER                                87 
Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The metal clams, released. Lt. Bergin. Standing next to him. 
SPOONER Don't people go to medical school any more? 
LT. BERGIN This is one of the best units in the city, Del. 
One of the Medical Robots turns to Spooner with some PILLS. Spooner. Stares it down. Grabs his clothes. 
SPOONER (sotto) There's some real shit going on here, John. 
He looks around.    Jumping off the bed. 
SPOONER I went to Hogenmiller's house -- there was a U.S.R. demolition crew there. They overrode my police I.D. Tried to tear down the house with me in it... 
LT. BERGIN Del... 
Spooner pulls on his pants. 
SPOONER ...Then when I went to the monorail a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the tracks...

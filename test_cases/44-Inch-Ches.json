{"train": "44 INCH CHEST \nWritten by \nLouis Mellis & David Scinto \nPROLOGUE \nStagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily. Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night. \nOnto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles... \nAnd on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank... Deserted... \nPastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined guttering... \nMoving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken... \nAnd if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... \"Take Me Back To Dear Ol' Blighty \" as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone bar surrounded by drunken men... \nWe keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards it... Towards the piss-coloured light... \nWe stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we have is all we can see... \nThe gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house... \nOn the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted... \nIn the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to us... Staring... \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSlightly behind, to his left, sitting nonchalantly cross- legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette, is MEREDITH, late 40's... Suave... Immaculate... Wearing black handmade boots, black Saville Row suit, black cashmere roll neck sweater, herring bone overcoat with a black velvet collar, brown leather gloves, his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined.... Behind him an old wardrobe... \nStanding with his back three quarters to us, and leaning on a broken, chipped, mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace is ARCHIE, aged 52... Big... Avuncular... Wearing a car coat and casual nondescript clothes... he is pouring himself a Captain Morgan's rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup... He sort of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks... \nStanding at the back of the room, in front of a door which             * has at some time been on fire, (it's yellowing, tobacco-ey paint charred and blistered), is MAL, aged mid-40's... Wearing a silver-grey suit, white shirt, duck-egg blue silk tie... \nThere is another man in the room but we do not see his face -- for he s its slu mpe d, h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he armchairs - a picture of despair. He wears an olive green shirt, brown trousers, maroon braces... This is COLIN, aged late 40's... \nCUT TO \nBlackness and silence... \nIn the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and tatty... Attached to skinny legs in black tights... The legs gangle and flip pulling into view a bony, pasty, bare torso which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head! - Long, lank, shoulder length hair... Dripping from a white domed pate - The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body- antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy, bulbous, rubbery... Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL! \nHe goon-walks about for a bit in the black space... Baboon- bottomed... As if knees tied together... Aflickin' and akickin' his clown boots... His unhappy face... Like death... Prancing... Ridiculous dancing... Absurd... \nGiant C/U on his morose contorted phizzog... \nMAX (Directly to us... darkly) ...Evenin'! \nCUT TO \nMusic...

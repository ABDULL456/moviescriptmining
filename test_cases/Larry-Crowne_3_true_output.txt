COX Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too 
LARRY CROWNE I thought I was Employee of the Month. 
STRANG In a way, you are. Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move. 
LARRY CROWNE No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house... 
COX The timing on this is always a bitch. 
LARRY CROWNE Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this? 
COX 
Really wish we could. 
(THEN) Vick? The generous severance package? She has a folder with posted "Sign Here's." 
HURLEY Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done. Strang finds one last piece of party pizza. 
EXT. UNIMART PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
Vasquez helps Larry put down the ragged top of his car. 
VASQUEZ 12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself. 
LARRY CROWNE Stick it out. You go to college? 
VASQUEZ Couple years. Then I blew out my 
KNEE 
LARRY CROWNE Thanks for seeing me off. 
VASQUEZ I need your apron, man. 
(AGAIN) Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so it ain't yours. Larry unharnesses himself from that which is not his. Hands it over. Branded. Scorned as the one let go... 
VASQUEZ (CONT'D) Thanks. 
(WALKING AWAY) Goofy car, man. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - LATER 
Larry pulls up at a red light. From his hands-free speaker jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear ON-HOLD Music. 
RECORDED VOICE 
Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD- "Remember, you always have a friend at RiverBank..." 
LIB where they are going next... 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE) Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for holding how may I help you? Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus. 
LARRY CROWNE I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate? 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you? 
LARRY CROWNE Barry is gone? I need to talk to someone in Home and Real Estate. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD 
The SCOOTER SQUAD has made their decision and peel out -- 
VROOM, YEOOW... 
LARRY CROWNE (reading his ATM card) I wish! I'm Customer number 566 7878 2031 339 and I can be there in three minutes! 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE) As long as you are here before six, okey dokey. ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is still yelling... 
LARRY CROWNE Three minutes! 
INT. RIVERBANK BRANCH - LATE AFTERNOON 
Larry sits at Gammelgaard's desk looking at his own records, sipping complimentary coffee that is ghastly. 
LARRY CROWNE 
What happened to Barry Raphael? 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (PRE-LAP) Barry Raphael was harassing the younger tellers but we are not supposed to admit that.

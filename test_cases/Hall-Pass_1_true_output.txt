(ANNOYED) Who would steal a golf cart? Gary shrugs. 
GARY Criminals? 
HOG-HEAD Does anyone have any napkins? 
GARY Look, all I know is I had it on the seventh tee and now it's gone. 
RICK What are you talking about? We're only on the sixth hole. 
GARY What? Did we miss a hole? Where's my kids? Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it together. Then he NOTICES something O.S.. 
RICK Oh, come on, man! ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and the guys look up. THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading straight for them. 
FRED Run for it! The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger 
HOT IN PURSUIT. 
GARY He's gaining on us! 
RICK I can't go any faster, I've got it floored! 
FRED Cut through the woods! Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART. With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog- head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE 
WOODS. 
EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY 
Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having lunch with their two young children. Their 7-Year-Old Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year- Old Son is dressed like the father. 
7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER Hey, Mom, look! The family turns to see... THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary are driving the golf cart down the city street. They stop at a traffic light beside them. All the guys stare straight ahead, ZOMBIE-LIKE, except for Fred who NOTICES the Longs. He nods. 
FRED Ed. Kimmy. Clones. The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the busy intersection, we go BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads. 
KIMMY Their poor wives. 
SMASH CUT TO: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: 
DAY 3 
EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON 
It's a picture perfect day as a THOUSAND PEOPLE watch a Cape Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic blankets. The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, MAGGIE'S PARENTS, and the kids are CLAPPING ALONG WITH THE CROWD. CRACK! The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD. 
SAME SCENE - LATER The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after the game. 
Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach. Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN. 
GERRY Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming out and supporting us. 
MAGGIE Oh, it was fun. You guys looked good. 
GERRY Thanks. Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging him on. 
GERRY (CONT'D) So...we saw you sitting up there with those little kids--are you nannies or something? The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile. 
MAGGIE No, they're my kids. 
GERRY 
(DUBIOUS) Yeah, right. You have three kids? 
MAGGIE Uh-huh. A couple other PLAYERS amble over. 
GERRY Dudes, they're not nannies, they're mommies. 
PLAYER #2 No way?! 
GRACE Well, she is, not me. I'm not old enough yet. Maggie and the players LAUGH. 
RICK COLEMAN (O.S.) Guys! The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN, approaching with MAGGIE'S FATHER, mid-70's. 
RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) Time to pack things up--let's go! 
The Players quickly scatter. 
MAGGIE'S FATHER Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman- -the coach. Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head of hair and an easy-going manner. 
RICK COLEMAN I hope those clowns weren't bothering you. 
MAGGIE Oh, no, they were sweet. 
GRACE Yeah. Cute kids. 
MAGGIE So you're the guy who's been taking money off my dad every Saturday on the golf course?

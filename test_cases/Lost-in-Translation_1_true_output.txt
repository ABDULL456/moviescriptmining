They look at each other across the empty elevator, both leaning against the walls. 
The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor. 
The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss good-night again and she gets out before the door closes. 
He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall.

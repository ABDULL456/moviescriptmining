ED Mm. 
They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head. 
DORIS ...What a knucklehead. 
STREET 
As the car roars past and into the distance. 
ANOTHER STREET 
It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a Packard and drives off. 
ED (V.O.) Big Dave did it, though... 
Ed, sitting in his car, is watching. 
ED (V.O.) ...I sent a note telling him where to drop the money... 
HOTEL HALLWAY 
Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray by the elevator. 
ED (V.O.) ...and he did. He came across. 
Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag. 
He goes back to the stairwell. 
ANOTHER FLOOR 
Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks. 
The door swings open. 
CREIGHTON Yeah, good, how are ya, come in... 
Ed follows him into the room. 
CREIGHTON ...You bring a check? 
ED Cash. 
CREIGHTON Cash?! 
He gives Ed a look. 
CREIGHTON ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh? 
ED Sure. 
CREIGHTON I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh? 
ED Yeah. 
CREIGHTON Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer-- 
ED It's OK. 
CREIGHTON Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point? 
He perspires as he counts the money. 
CREIGHTON ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh-- 
ED That'll be fine. 
CREIGHTON Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh... 
He wipes his brow, finishes counting. 
CREIGHTON ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.

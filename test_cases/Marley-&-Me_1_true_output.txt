JOHN 
(SHOUTING) What are you looking at?! He's losing his balls today! Cut the guy some slack! 
63 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY 
John sits at his desk, tries to write a column. Sebastian, in a flak jacket, pauses at his desk... 
SEBASTIAN Strip mall get approved? 
JOHN Riveting planning commission vote. Knuckle-biter. 8 to 1. 
SEBASTIAN You up for a beer? 
JOHN Can't, I gotta finish the column. Maybe tomorrow? 
SEBASTIAN Can't, I'll be in L.A. Part of that drug piece I'm doing-- 
JOHN Right. Another time then. John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip flop in his mouth. John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts typing a new one. 
64 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - LATER 64 
John sits anxiously across from Arnie who sits at his desk reading. The editor's expression is grim as he looks up at John. 
JOHN I'm really sorry, I'll go back and do the zoning piece-- 
ARNIE The hell you sorry for? It's hilarious. John sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is, Arnie's face doesn't say "hilarious," but... 
Shooting Draft  42. 
MARLEY & ME 64 
64 CONTINUED: 
ARNIE (CONT'D) I loved it. Getting kicked out of obedience school, the humping, the "Great Escape," all of it. Hysterical. Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the paper back to John. 
ARNIE (CONT'D) Run it. As is. 
JOHN Thank you, sir. John starts out of the office. 
ARNIE Hey, Gorgan... 
(THEN) Tell him not to feel bad. Sooner or later, we all lose our balls. 
JOHN I'll be sure to pass that on. 
65 EXT. CUBAN RESTAURANT - PATIO - NIGHT 
Live music, a sexy vibe. John and Jenny sit outside in the hot Florida night. Dinner over, John raises his glass... 
JOHN To two years. 
JENNY That was fast. 
JOHN Good, though, right? 
JENNY Really good. He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one. 
JOHN So. What's next? 
JENNY I was thinking desert. 
JOHN No, I mean on your list. 
65 CONTINUED: 
JENNY My list? 
JOHN ed, Remember, when we first got marri you had this whole checklist, with like the game plan. 
JENNY Right... 
JOHN So what came next? 
JENNY Let's see... a new car maybe? 
JOHN afterthat? We can do that. What was 
JENNY 
(BEAT) You sure you wanna know? 
JOHN Yeah. 
JENNY well, it was between a new roof and a baby. He studies her for a long moment, then...

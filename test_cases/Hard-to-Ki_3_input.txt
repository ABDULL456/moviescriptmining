STORM (in b.g., weakly, directly behind) -- Nurse ... 
Andy whips around, sucking air and falling back, knocking over an IV UNIT -- which SHATTERS on the floor! 
She turns and sprints from the room. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - TRACKING STORM'S GURNEY - NIGHT 
As we crash through  doors WITH it. MOVING FAST. Knotted around Storm is an  emergency team of doctors and nurses. A controlled chaos  of AD LIB status reports and queries from them overlaps  as the doors swing shut behind them. 
Andy is left alone on the coma ward. 
INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT 
Andy unlocks a drawer, pulls out a laminated card from the record notice section. She picks up a phone, punches in a long series of numbers. 
INTERCUT: 
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DETECTIVES' ROOM - NIGHT 
The PHONE on someone's desk begins RINGING.   JONES, a plainclothesman, picks it up.

JONES Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant Jones. 
ANDY My name is Andrea Simpson. I'm calling from U.C.I. Medical Center. I'd like to speak with (reads from card) Captain O'Malley. 
Wheels start to turn in Jones' head. 
JONES What is this in regard to, please? 
ANDY I have a John Doe coma patient, code access 461 zebra, with instructions to notify upon any change in condition. 
JONES What is the change? 
ANDY (with enthusiasm) The patient has regained consciousness. 
Jones reacts -- puts his hand over the receiver, turns to a leather-faced plainclothesman (NOLAN) at the next desk. 
JONES (urgent) Nolan. Get Holland at home ... right now. (back to Andy on phone) I'm sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain O'Malley is no longer with this division. Let me take your information. Please ... contact no one else on this matter. 
INT. COMA WARD - NIGHT 
Storm back in bed. A knot of doctors finishes returning him from their emergency resuscitation work. "We'll leave him here for tonight, where they've got the full support setup." The team wraps up and begins to move off. 
The TEAM LEADER instructs Andy in Storm's immediate condition and care.

DOCTOR (TEAM LEADER) -- Clip him with 50 cc of Thorazine if he gives you any trouble. I'm afraid he's very disoriented and quite paranoid. He thinks people are trying to kill him. 
The team exits. Andy is alone in the ward with the immobile patients -- and Storm. Storm groans and tries to lift himself onto an elbow. 
STORM Miss ... please ... they won't tell me ... think I'm too disorient -- 
ANDY This is U.C.I. Medical Center. You've been in a coma. Your charts go back for seven years. 
STORM (staggered) Seven... years? 
He can't absorb this.   It's too much.   His mind reels. 
STORM Who ... who knows I'm awake? 
ANDY (innocent enthusiasm) It's all over the hospital. You're the first one that's come out of a coma of this duration. You'll probably be on the news! (beat) You'll be famous! 
STORM (struggles to sit up; fails) Listen to me carefully -- (reads her name tag) -- Andy. I don't have the strength to talk much. I'm a cop. My wife ... family ... murdered. That's how I got here. If you don't get me out ... you and I ... good chance ... both be dead. 
ANDY Please -- you're in no danger here.

She touches him kindly -- but Storm sees that she doesn't believe him, thinks he's paranoid. 
STORM Goddamit -- (urgent but weak) can't stay here. Listen to me - 
ANDY I'll have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. It'll help you relax. 
STORM No -- 
ANDY Listen... I've got work to do. You're my cutest patient, but you're not my only one.

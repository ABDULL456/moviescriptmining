569	Outside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other room. 
Roger:	WE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM. 
Peter:	THAT'S RIGHT ROG. 
Roger:	DIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM? 
Peter:	WE SURE DID, BUDDY. 
Roger:	WE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL! 
The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big storage area bouncing off barren walls. 
570	A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the new partition look like a finished wall. 
In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which has obviously been used. 
Fran:	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS PERFECT. 
Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a perfect match. 
Steve:	(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE IT OFF? 
Fran:	NO... 
The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper. 
571	The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way. They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony. It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away. 
572	Fran:	NO. 
She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down his hammer and follows. 
573	The woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His hand falls on her back. 
Fran:	LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM. 
Steve:	FRANNIE... 
Fran:	JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU HERE. 
The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry. 
Fran:	I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY... 
Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her hand back leaning over the toilet bowl. 
Fran:	PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE... 
Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of her pregnancy. 
574	Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing down the corridor at the pile of corpses. 
Peter:	THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA CLEAN UP, BROTHER. 
Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the balcony. 
575	Peter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe. 
Peter:	THEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST. 
The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open. 
576	Inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men approach the piles of money, stooping down. 
They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges... 
Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at him quizzically. 
Peter:	YOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER. 
Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He looks about the enormous vault. 
Steve:	DON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES... JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER. 
Peter:	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW..... 
577	We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items pretend to represent. 
578	At the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies through the lobby.

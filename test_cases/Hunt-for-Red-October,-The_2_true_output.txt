CUT TO: 
ADMIRAL JAMES GREER sixties; a mane of white hair, in three piece suit, CIA direcbor of naval intelligence, looking up from behind a mahogany desk: 
GREER Jack, boy. Get yourself in here. 
(SQUHTUNG) Jesus. You look like hell. 
RYAN 
(EGG) Thanks, Admiral. 
GREER Come on over here and sit down. You want coffee? 
RYAN I think I need ooffiae. Ryan perches on the couch. Greer pours Ryan takes it in both hands, coaling it with his breath. 
GREER I'm not gonna ask you how your 11 flight was. When's the last time you slept? -- 
RYAN 
(EYEING WATCH) Don't know. This thing is still on London time. 
GREER How's Margaret? 
RYAN Fine. She sends you her best. 
GREER And Sally? What is she now, three? 
RYAN A very precocious five. A week ago she announced her life would be a loot less lonely if Margaret and I would buy her a baby brother. 
GREER 
(SMILING) Where you gonna do that? Ryan grins. Greer eyes him fondly. Putting down his coffee, Ryan opens his br efse. 
GREER (CONT'D) All right, what's important enough to get you on a . plane in the middle of the night? 
JUMP CUT TO: 
A PAIR OF PHOTOGRAPHS dropping onto the tihle in front of Greer. They show the bow and stern of a submarine in dry dock. From the size of the construction crey, it's obvious the boat is huge. 
RYAN British Intelligence received these two days ago. She's the Red October. The Soviet's newest typhoon. 
GREER Jesus. The Brits actually got a man into the construction shed? 
RYAN 
(DROPPING MORE 
PHOTOS) This pair was digitally enhanced for line resolution. This one for color. 
RYAN Twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon, three meters wider. The captain's name is Ramixts. 
GREER One of yours? 
RYAN Yes, sir. I did the bio on him last year. He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years. Fairly good political connections. He's also trained most of their attack boat skippers. They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster. Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something captures his attention: 
GREER What are these doors? 
RYAN The doors, Admiral, are the problem. I don't know what they are and neither do the English. 
(SIPPING CAFFEE) it's just pole our friends at the Ustinov Design Bureau have come up with something new. 
(BEAT) With your permission, I'd like to show these to someone. Do you know Skip Tyler? 
GREER Sub driver. Did he get hurt or something? 
RYAN 
(NODDING) He was Captain on an attack boat. Got clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg. Now he's teaching at the Academy and doing some consulting for Underwater Systems Command.

SEBASTIAN ... on myself. 
The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws drop and they stare at him with wide eyes. 
FRANK Are you nuts? 
SEBASTIAN Was Jonas Salk nuts? 
FRANK Yeah. Pretty sure he was. 
CARTER And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died. 
SEBASTIAN If we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else? 
JANICE Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway? 
SARAH She's right. We haven't even finished collating the phase two research. 
SEBASTIAN We'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later. Monkey data doesn't matter anyway. The only real data is human data. 
SARAH You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans. 
SEBASTIAN How are we gonna find out? Besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98% the same as humans. And the 2% is not that significant. 
LINDA Sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla's live in trees. That's a helluva 2% if you ask me. 
SEBASTIAN We're all concerned. I know that. But if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do. 
LINDA Why you? Why not one of us? 
SEBASTIAN The risks. I couldn't ask... 
MATT (interrupting) What if we volunteer? 
LINDA What if you're too valuable to lose? 
SEBASTIAN I'm Project Leader. It's my formula and my call. The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. I'll want about four weeks to... 
FRANK To put your affairs in order? 
SEBASTIAN To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. I'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression. 
INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE 
A knock on the door. 
SEBASTIAN Come in. 
Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind her. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What? 
LINDA In the past six years, I've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... Sebastian. I don't think you should do this. 
SEBASTIAN You don't understand. 
LINDA Oh please. How long were we together? You must've said it a million times ... Nobody knows who built the lunar lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon. 
Sebastian shrugs and nods. 
LINDA (cont'd) But what if something happens to you... what about the project? 
Sebastian smiles. 
SEBASTIAN Lin, trust me... nothing's going to happen. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted. 
LINDA He refuses to listen to reason. 
MATT Can we talk about this later? I'm trying to make love to you. 
LINDA Sorry. I just can't let it go. 
Matt props himself up on the pillow. 
MATT I know how you're feeling. Hell, he and I've been friends since freshman year. 
LINDA So how can we let him do this? 
MATT What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go? 
LINDA In a heartbeat.

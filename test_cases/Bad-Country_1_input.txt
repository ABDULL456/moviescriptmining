SHERRY Comin' up. 
Bud blows smoke, distant from the others. 
MARANDINO Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'. 'Been workin' this case for months. And you ain't said shit. 
BUD They had a lot of weight. Too much. 
COBB It's a ring. Organized burglary. 
BUD You saw them guys. You think that half ass crew was organized? 
MARANDINO (laughs) They shit their pants in unison. 
COBB What are you gettin' after, Bud? 
SHEPARD You think it was someone else's score. 
Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on. 
BUD I think its a part of somethin' bigger. 
Bud takes his shot. 
BUD Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp. If they know this "someone else", we'll know him too. 
EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY 
A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY 
Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM, where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler. 
RAY I told you... I keep tellin' you... I don't know nothin'. That's it. 
COBB That's not it. We've been here all morning. We'll stay here all night. 
Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose). 
MARANDINO The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers". The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both owners can verify their belongings, and have. (beat) Who you fencin' for? 
GRACE Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit. 
MARANDINO Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it. 
GRACE That's bullshit. 
MARANDINO No, that's a promise. 
Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview... 
COBB We got a series of burglaries in the area. All over the last six months. All still open. You don't talk, it's on you. 
RAY Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that. 
COBB Any idea who does? 
RAY No! Okay? Fuck no. 
Bud sets down his coffee, calm. 
INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM 
Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated. 
MARANDINO ...Answer the question. 
GRACE (exploding) MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS! 
The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down. 
BUD Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS! 
GRACE I ain't a rat! 
BUD YOU AIN'T A RAT?! 
Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS. 
MARANDINO Easy, Bud. Go easy. 
GRACE (to Marandino) STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM! 
Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off. 
BUD LOCK THE DOOR! 
Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder, nearly rips it off his face. 
BUD I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! 
Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks. 
BUD GIVE ME A NAME! 
GRACE (hacking) He's from Whiskey Bay--! 
BUD --GIVE ME A NAME!!

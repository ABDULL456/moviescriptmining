Eve leans against the sink, annoyed.   She pulls her mask down. 
EVE Rayon, the whole point of this study is to determine whether AZT is helping people. 
RAYON Come on, Evie, you know there ain't no helpin' me. 
EVE That doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying. 
RAYON Why you so good to me? 
Rayon watches Eve for a while, with affection. He grabs her and holds on to her. These two seem to have a history. 
31   EXT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - REAR - DAY                           31 
A steady drizzle. Ron stands out by the dumpster, his boots and cowboy hat soaked. The Hispanic Orderly emerges from the hospital, a large garbage bag in his hands. 
HISPANIC ORDERLY There ain't no more, they started lockin' it up. 
The Orderly throws the garbage into the dumpster. 
RON I got more cash. 
The Orderly studies Ron who holds out some money. The Orderly snatches it, and writes something on a piece of paper. 
ORDERLY Here.   In Mexico. A doctor, he has some. 
Ron takes the paper, looks at it. 
RON What the hell is this bullshit? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 23 
Ron takes a swing at the Orderly but misses. Something about Ron is off. We hear the ringing sound again. Ron struggles to stand and collapses onto the ground. Black. 
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.) Mr. Woodroof? 
32   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - ROOM - NIGHT                      32 
Ron lays in bed asleep, an I.V. tube hooked up to his arm. 
FEMALE VOICE (V.O.) Ron? 
Ron's eyes slowly peel open. Eve is hovering over him, a surgical mask on her face. As he looks at her, a faint smile passes his lips. 
RON Beautiful. 
Eve frowns, didn't expect that. 
EVE You're in the hospital. 
Ron blinks.   Clears the fantasy.    His eyes scan the room. 
EVE You almost died. 
RON I'm sure that didn't surprise anyone. 
Eve seems to smile behind her mask. 
RON Was that a smile? 
Eve You've had a blood transfusion. 
Dr. Sevard steps forward. 
Dr. Sevard Mr. Woodroof I'm doctor Sevard. 
Ron I remember you. 
Dr. Sevard I need you to tell me where you obtained AZT from. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 23A 
RON Who said I was on AZT? 
DR. SEVARD Dealing in pharmaceutical drugs is illegal.

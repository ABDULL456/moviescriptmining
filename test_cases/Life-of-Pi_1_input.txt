MOTHER That is true. Your father is right. Science can teach us more about what's out there - (With a hand to her heart:) - but not what is in here. Art, music, literature - they all spring from our faith. 
FATHER Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand? 
Pi nods. 
FATHER (CONT'D) Good. 
Pause. 
PI I would like to be baptized. 
Father and Mother react. Ravi stifles a laugh. 
46   EXT. PI'S STREET - DAY                                    46 
Pi walks down the front steps of his row house, stretching and rubbing his belly at the end of a good meal. The writer follows. 
WRITER So you're a Christian and a Muslim? 
ADULT PI And a Hindu, of course. 
WRITER And a Jew, I suppose? 
ADULT PI Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms. 
WRITER But no room for doubt? 
ADULT PI Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested. 
47   INT. THE TIGER FEEDING AREA, 1973, PART 1   - DAY            47 
Pi (12) and Ravi (14) cross into a drab cement enclosure behind the tiger exhibit. A hallway with closed gates at both ends leads out to the exhibit. 
RAVI Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him. 
PI Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger. 
He drops meat on the floor by the bars. 
RAVI Pi!... 
PI Hello! Richard Parker!

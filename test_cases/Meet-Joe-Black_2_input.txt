Screenplay by Bo Goldman 
EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM 
A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish. 
INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM 
MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans. 
INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM 
MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm. 
Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself: 
VOICE (V.O.) ... Yes. 
Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. 
He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes up: 
VOICE (V.O.) Yes... 
It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild- ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. 
He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his eyes. 
VOICE (V.O.) Yes. 
Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep. 
EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING 
The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. 
A Painter approaches. 
PAINTER The big tent, Miss Allison -- 
ALLISON Paint is rust and moss green. Medieval colors -- Daddy's like an old knight. 
A Florist stops her. 
FLORIST The head table --? 
ALLISON What about it? 
FLORIST The flowers, ma'am--? 
ALLISON Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy loves freesia -- and you, over there, lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking for a saffron glow -- sort of tea- dance twenties. 
EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING 
Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ- ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish passes. 
PARRISH What do you think of all this, May? 
MAY It's going to be beautiful.  And Miss Allison says the President may come. 
PARRISH Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party. 
MAY (smiling) What? 
Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace. 
ALLISON Daddy! 
PARRISH Hi, Allison -- 
ALLISON Have you got a minute? 
PARRISH Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind? 
ALLISON Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept... 
PARRISH Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing. 
ALLISON But it's your birthday. 
Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee. 
SUSAN Good morning, Dad. 
PARRISH Hi, honey. 
ALLISON (to Susan) I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. 
SUSAN (smiling) Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. 
PARRISH Drew's aboard? 
SUSAN He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours -- 
But Parrish only pours coffee. 
SUSAN (cont'd) (to Allison) You coming? 
ALLISON You've got patients waiting, I've got three hysterical chefs, one loves truffles, the other hates truffles, the third one doesn't know what truffles are.  I'd better drive down. 
Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity. 
PARRISH (unconsciously) I hate parties -- 
ALLISON Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it. 
PARRISH Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it. 
ALLISON No. 
Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.

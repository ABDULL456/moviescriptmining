INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. 
SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge. 
ALLEYN Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage! 
The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault. 
ALLEYN (CONT'D) (furious) Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! Are you a lady, Mr. Kent? 
THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an argument. 
WILL (preempting) You did not like the speech? 
ALLEYN The speech is excellent. (he does the first line impressively) "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible. 
WILL points significantly at the pages he has given PETER. 
WILL There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: "a plague on both your houses!" 
NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns back. 
ALLEYN He dies? 
But the author has escaped. 
INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. 
Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the floor. That done, he picks up his pen. 
EXT. STREET. NIGHT. 
WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern. 
BURBAGE Will! 
WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls after him. 
BURBAGE (CONT'D) And where are my pages . . . 
WILL hurries on. 
EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK. 
VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears shouting. 
WILL (O.S. shouting) Did you give her my letter? 
VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind, following in another boat. She takes a letter from her coat and holds it aloft. 
VIOLA AS THOMAS (calling) And this for you. 
EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. 
WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA. 
WILL Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. 
BOATMAN Writer, is he? 
WILL turns on him savagely 
WILL Row your boat. 
EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. 
WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore him. 
WILL She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS If you love her, you must do what she asks. 
WILL And break her heart and mine? 
VIOLA AS THOMAS It is only ours you can know. 
WILL She loves me, Thomas! 
VIOLA AS THOMAS Does she say so? 
WILL No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?

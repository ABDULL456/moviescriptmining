INT. LAZARUS'S HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Rae occasionally strums an awful chord as she sings playfully. 
RAE (trying to sing) You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. You'll never know dear how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. A voice from outside spins her around. The guitar barks as Rae slams it down on the table. 
LINCOLN (O.S.) Mister Lazarus? 
Rae stays hidden as she peeks out the front window. Lincoln is standing before the house holding an old picnic basket. Rae's middle finger begins scraping against the wall. 
LINCOLN Mister Laz... I come for the butter beans. 
Rae fights her dizziness. She crawls to the radiator as she hears each creak of Lincoln crossing to the front door. 
FLASH TO 
QUICK CUTS 
The Zippo with the bald eagle closes. A smoldering cigarette. 
FLASH BACK TO: 
Rae flinches and grits her teeth as Lincoln knocks on the door: Knock, knock. 
LINCOLN Ain't seen you on the square. Mister Laz, can you hear me? 
The burning has started: deep gasps, itching, anxiety. 
LINCOLN (worried now) Mister Lazarus? 
Rae watches the shadows of Lincoln's shoes under the door. They wait patiently and walk away. 
EXT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON 
Lincoln walks down the porch steps and stops. Thinks. 
INT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON 
Rae inches upward, pulling herself up the radiator so she can stand. Her panting has waned. 
Suddenly the front door swings open. 
LINCOLN Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside... 
Lincoln can't believe what he sees. Rae is chained around the waist, damp and barely clothed. Her eyes bore into Lincoln like an owl zeroing in on a helpless jackrabbit. 
She rips her shirt off in one tug over her head. 
Lincoln can't move. The picnic basket hits the floor. His mouth hangs open in shock as Rae steps towards him and lays her open mouth on the boy. 
EXT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON 
SLAM! Rae shuts the door. 
Laz steers his Ford truck up the drive and parks. He takes his time getting out and removing the shopping bags. He opens the door and goes inside. 
His curses can be heard from outside. 
LAZARUS SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...! 
Lincoln is tossed off the porch, clinging to his overalls. 
LAZARUS CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE... 
Tears and fear come to Lincoln as Laz steps out onto the porch, fuming with rage. 
Lincoln backs away expecting a good beating. He starts running up the drive but stops as R.L.'s Olds rolls up the drive. 
LAZARUS Lincoln, come on back. 
Lincoln darts past Laz and runs into the barn, clutching his overalls. R.L. stops the car halfway down the drive and steps out. 
R.L. Was that Lincoln James I seen run off? 
LAZARUS He's fine. Just had a bad fall. 
R.L. Why's his britches round his knees? 
LAZARUS R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place. 
R.L. starts walking up the drive. 
R.L. You get a call from Rose?

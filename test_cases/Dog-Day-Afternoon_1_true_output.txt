INT. BANK - DAY 
ANGLE ON SAL WITH THE GROUP 
as Sonny enters and walks toward Sal. 
SONNY Okay... okay... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out... it's gonna be okay. 
SAL Get over there! 
SONNY Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big...  limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet... so things are rollin'...  They're movin'... I also ordered some food... I got some pizzas for us, all right? I got some things to drink - I got sodas... I even asked them for aspirins... I'm doin' what I can... now I gotta pay for the pizza... where are the marked bills? 
He now walks behind Tellers' cages and picks up some of the decoy money that Edna had started to clean up and re-stack. Mulvaney walks over to him. 
MULVANEY Are we going to get the ball rolling? 
SONNY What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy... I'm keeping you happy... I gotta keep the cops cooled out... I gotta do everything... I gotta pay for the pizza .. I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all... I got all the ideas... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over? 
Sonny walks to the front door with the money. 
EXT. BANK DOOR - DAY 
as Sonny appears in it. 
NEW ANGLE TO REVEAL THE DELIVERY BOY 
guarded by a couple of cops. 
DELIVERY BOY You the guy wanted the pizza? 
Sonny grabs bills from the wad he holds and thrusts them at him. 
DELIVERY BOY It's paid for. (looks at Moretti; Moretti nods) 
SONNY Keep the change... 
As the cops reach for the money, knowing it's bank money, people in the crowd yell: 
CROWD AD LIBS Hey, over here!  Hey, robber!  How about a thousand!  Throw some over here!  Hey, no shit, I need an operation, I don't even have a job... (Etc.) 
Sonny holds up the money.  The crowd cheers.  He throws the wad of bills and it scatters in the air. 
The WIND is blowing now.  Even some cops join the ensuing melee to gather it up... 
VARIOUS ANGLES 
as cops move forward and try to catch the bills.  Some blow into the crowd.  Fights break out in the crowd as they scramble for the money.  The crowd breaks the barriers and swarms after the cash.  Cops try to retrieve bills; fist fights, arrests. 
MORETTI 
staring at the mess. 
Sonny also watching the people. 
There is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust at the greed unleashed.  Sonny angrily hurls another bundle after the first... then laughs as he watches the people fighting. 
Moretti nods ironically at him.  Sonny turns and enters the bank with the food.  The fighting goes on in the street. 
INT. BANK - DAY 
as Sonny enters carrying food. 
SONNY Okay - Chow! 
He puts it down in front of Mulvaney, on Mulvaney's desk. Mulvaney looks at it, sickly.  As Mulvaney looks up at Sonny: 
SONNY You eat it first.  I don't know if they put something in it. 
EXT. SIDEWALK NEAR BANK - DAY 
Moretti, Sheldon, other top cops march fast-time toward the barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that has drawn up to the barrier.  It is full of white-haired officials, one of them the COMMISSIONER.  He has a voice broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at football games. 
DOLLY AT A LOW DRAMATIC ANGLE WITH MORETTI AND ETC. 
It looks like they may be going into action.  Moretti's attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to brass.  Commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through window. 
The Commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, covers Moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages Moretti's hand fondly. 
COMMISSIONER Gene -- you smilin'? 
MORETTI No.  I never smile any more. 
COMMISSIONER Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene? 
MORETTI I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out. 
COMMISSIONER Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is! 
A lot of comfortable CHUCKLES inside the limo.  The Commissioner's hand lingers on Moretti's -- they are fond of each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a lifetime of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness -- an accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner, of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secure in the bastion of their roles.  What is being passed on here is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally masculine society: police.  The homosexual content of this should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, for what they share.

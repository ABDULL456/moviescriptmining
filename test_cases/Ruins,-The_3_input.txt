BACK TO SCENE Stacy stands there, looking scared. There's another RING. 
JEFF (O.S.) Can you see it? Stacy lifts her head, SHOUTS: 
STACY No. She keeps peering into the shadows, not moving. The ringing falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it: the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others: STACY (cont'd) The lamp's almost out of oil. 
JEFF (O.S.) Then blow it out. 
Stacy seems terrified by this. 
STACY Blow it out? 
JEFF (0.5.) We'll need it when we come down. To get him on the backboard. Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn't want to blow it out. Mathias watches her, silent. JEFF (O.S.) (cont'd) All right? Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness. 
EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK 
The.sun is just touching the horizon, the sky turning red. Th ey've tied the braids of nylon onto the rope, attached the finished backboard to them. It rests beside the shaft, padded with one-of the archaeologist's sleeping bags. Jeff and Eric remove their belts, drop them onto the backboard. They step to the windlass, lean against its hand crank, the rope going taut. Amy stands by the shaft, gathering her courage. Then she reaches for the backboard. 
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness. The windlass begins its CREAKING. A long beat, and then: 
AMY (O.S.) Stacy? 
STACY What? 
AMY -(0.5.) Light the lamp! Stacy shifts; once again, there's the RASP of a match, then the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick. Mathias's eyes are shut; there's a deep RAGGEDNESS to his breathing. Stacy looks upward. 
STACY'S POV - ABOVE HER The backboard is dropping toward us. Above it, the light is already fading from the sky. 
BACK TO SCENE Stacy rises to her feet, lifting the lamp. 
ON AMY - CROUCHING ON THE BACKBOARD She's dropping slowly down the shaft, clenching the nylon braids, her eyes tightly shut: terrified. The backboard sways, pendulum-like, as it descends, almost touching the vine-covered walls. 
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT When the backboard comes within reach, Stacy grabs it, pulling it to the-right, so that it will come to rest at Mathias's side. But then, with three feet still to go, it jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch. A beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above: 
JEFF (O.S.) Have you reached them? 
AMY Almost. A few more feet. 
JEFF (O.S.} How many? Amy leans, peers down at Mathias's broken body. 
AMY I don't know. Three? 
JEFF (O.S.} we're out of rope. (a beat) Can you still do it? Amy looks at Stacy; neither speaks. Finally, QUIETLY: 
STACY We'll have to send it back up, I guess. 
Amy doesn't answer. She shifts her weight, and the backboard starts to swing. Stacy reaches to steady it. STACY (cont'd) Blow out the lamp. Wait here in the dark. Amy is silent, staring down at Mathias's still form; it's obvious she doesn't want to do this. STACY (cont'd) Or we could try to lift him, maybe. More silence. Stacy persists: STACY (cont'd) One of us at his shoulders. The other his feet. 
AMY If he twists-- 
STACY It's only a few feet. /"- Once more, Amy is silent. Stacy lifts the lamp, examining it, the diminishing pool of oil. STACY (cont'.d) We have to decide. The light's not going to last. Jeff's voice comes toward them from above again: 
JEFF (O.S.) Amy...? They both look up; the sky has grown too dark to see him. Amy hesitates one beat more, then YELLS: 
AMY We're gonna try itt She climbs off the backboard, crouches beside Mathias. Stacy sets down the lamp. AMY (cont'd) Mathias...? She touches his shoulder, and he opens his eyes, stares at her. He looks haggard, ashen.

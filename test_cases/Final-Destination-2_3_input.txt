Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL! 
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster. 
When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor. 
The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke. 
EVAN Jesus Christ! 
Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He begins COUGHING in the smoke. 
Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape. 
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as -- 
A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire completely engulfs the kitchen. 
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape. He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor. 
A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact. 
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground. 
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- 
SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back. 
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway! 
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket! 
INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT 
Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning. 
Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 "survivors". 
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, "PREMONITION" -- 
SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him. 
Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest. 
DETECTIVE SUBY (as if entranced) Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department. 
Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands. 
THOMAS You've made your point. 
DETECTIVE SUBY Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me. 
THOMAS What? 
DETECTIVE SUBY Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought. 
Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas looks stunned. 
INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream. 
KAT No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. (beat; rolls her eyes) Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go. 
She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:

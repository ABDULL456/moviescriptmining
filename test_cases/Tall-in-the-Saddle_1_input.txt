ON ROCKLIN 
He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, but loud enough to be heard by the women. 
ROCKLIN I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman. 
INT. COACH - DAY 
THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles vindictively at Clara, who flushes. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the coach door. 
CLERK Well, I hope you have a nice trip, ladies. 
MISS MARTIN I hope we get there -- wouldn't surprise me if we didn't. 
EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY 
On Dave and Rocklin. 
DAVE (mutters) Wait till I get you on the road, you old buzzard, you'll be surprised all right. 
He takes up the reins and shouts the team away. 
DISSOLVE OUT 
DISSOLVE IN 
EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY 
EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach. 
EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, Dave steals a look at his companion. 
DAVE I wonder why a young feller who don't have to wants to come into this God danged country? 
Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. Dave glances down toward the women. 
DAVE Say -- did you mean what you said back there about wimmen? 
ROCKLIN (grimly) Every word of it. 
DAVE (chuckling) Then you're smarter than most. 
ROCKLIN Maybe I seen more of 'em than most. 
DAVE (looking at him admiringly) Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be a leetle bit surprised. (reflectively) All the same... 
He breaks off and chuckles again. 
ROCKLIN (unsmilingly) All the same -- what? 
Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail. 
DAVE (offering bottle to Rocklin) Take a slug. 
Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all but empties it in one pull. 
DAVE (holding up the bottle and squinting through it) Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are? Both fool you, but you never figger out how to do without 'em. 
Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again. 
DAVE Take another. 
ROCKLIN Not just yet. 
DAVE (unoffended) Well... (putting the bottle to his lips) Here's to her. 
ROCKLIN Who? 
DAVE The next one that fools you. 
He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over and looks down o.s. 
INT. COACH - DAY 
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is hanging on grimly. 
EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY 
Dave straightens up, grinning. 
DAVE (with relish) Mighty rough stretch along here. 
He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat. 
ROCKLIN Like me to speel you a while? 
DAVE Nope. I've had a few snorts but that don't make no difference. Leas'ways, never has... (after a second's pause) Don't ever git wore out, and useless, like me. 
ROCKLIN Who're them as say you are? 
DAVE Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly- aching. Reckon he's entitled to his opinion. But him and me never did see eye to eye. 
ROCKLIN What's wrong? 
DAVE It's constitootional, I reckon. Like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he's too sane. Believes In law and order. 
ROCKLIN (grinning) What's wrong with law and order? 
DAVE Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. Never was good at takin' orders meself. As for the law -- well, you'll soon find out what that means 'round these parts.

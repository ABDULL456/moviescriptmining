The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match. 
INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION) 
A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync with the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S REPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show, and they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY. 
In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and STU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional, abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak. 
STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon on the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously around to see how the rest of the audience is responding. 
Why? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen. In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self- deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY. 
INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED) 
As the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of LITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL... 
INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED) 
A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his mouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat. 
STANLEY How about it, Doc? Can you help me? 
SHRINK Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take time. I vould estimate...roughly... 
On the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40- foot CABIN CRUISER. "NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!" With his free hand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR... 
SHRINK Twelve years and three months ought to do it. 
The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand. 
STANLEY One question, doc - what did you mean when you said "imaginary"? 
SHRINK All in good time, my boy. All in good time. 
The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats. Then he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER. 
SHRINK Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!! 
Now he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will. 
VOICE IN BACKPACK Imaginary, huh? You quack. 
EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED) 
A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the way down to the street. 
SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building. He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE. 
STANLEY Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a good shrink. 
MONKEYBONE Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you how to stop sucking your thumb... 
MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off into the sunset. 
INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up. HERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium: 
HERB Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is, Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an order for six new episodes! 
HERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the room who's still in his seat. 
HERB Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu Miley! 
A SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks genuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening. 
JULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She WINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE at the adoring crowd. 
INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT 
STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS. 
STU I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at Nike doing that. 
A beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.

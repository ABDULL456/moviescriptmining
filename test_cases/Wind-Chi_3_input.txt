HEADLIGHTS suddenly appear up ahead, blindingly bright. 
GUY (cont'd) What the hell? 
She turns to look ahead, momentarily forgetting their fight as the oncoming headlights cross the median into their lane. 
GIRL You think he doesn't see us? 
GUY How can he not? 
26   EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT                                    26 
From a high angle overlooking the road we watch the two cars racing toward one another, headed on a collision course. 
27   INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                                     27 
For the time being their fight has taken a back seat to the oncoming car playing chicken with them. 
GIRL Pull over and let this asshole by. 
GUY Over where? There's no shoulder. 
He's right. On the passenger side the road abuts a steep wooded hillside. Opposite that it drops off into a ravine. 
They are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO: Brenda Lee's 1958 hit "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree." 
BRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, at the Christ-mas par-ty hop... 
28   EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT                                    28 
The distance between the SPEEDING CARS is closing rapidly. 
29   INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                                     29 
The kids faces go white in the glare of the oncoming lights.

BRENDA LEE Mistletoe hung where you can see, Ev'ry couple tries to STOP. Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, have a happy hol-i-day... Later we'll have some pumpkin pie, and do some car- rol-ing... 
30   EXT. ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT                                     30 
The OTHER CAR continues barrelling toward the OLDSMOBILE. The game of chicken fast approaching the point of no return. 
BRENDA LEE You will get a sen-ti-men-tal fee- ling when you hear... Voices singing "Let's be jolly, DECK the halls with boughs of holly"... 
31   INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                                      31 
Relief turns to dread as they realize the other car isn't slowing. 
GIRL He's not stopping! 
GUY Hold on! 
He jerks the wheel hard, sending the Oldsmobile fishtailing out of control. 
The OTHER CAR skids over a small bridge and drops out of sight. 
They spin out in the opposite direction. Skid off the road and SLAM into a snowbank with a bone-shuddering CRASH. 
BRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day. Everyone's dancing mer-ri-ly in the New. Old. Fash-ioned. Wa-a-ay!

32   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 32 
The Oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing the wrong way, its driver's side jammed into a snowbank.

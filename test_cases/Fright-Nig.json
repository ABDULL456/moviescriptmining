{"test1_input": "ON JANE Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit. \nINT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAY \nThe Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban paradise. Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed. Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty, and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a sneakerhead, a serious collector. \nBEE Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck. \nAMY Charlie. \nBEE Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck? Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort. \nCHARLIE It's -- they're not -- that's, like, puce? That's a macho puce. \nCARA Can you stop someplace? I'm severely under-caffeinated. \nAMY (ignores her/to Bee) Did you see the poster for the formal? The theme is \"Hope\"? \nBEE I know. They asked me to be on the committee again but I was like -- hope is completely 2008. Grow up. \nCHARLIE Did you suggest \"Despair?\" Nobody would see that coming. Or -- global warming? Everybody has to wear tin foil. \nAMY (laughs/to Charlie) Did you go last year? We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me. \nCHARLIE \n(LIES) Me? I, ah, was in training that week. This big triatha-- \nBEE (cutting him off) Chuck was still under his rock. We're so glad you crawled out. \nCARA Caffeine!? Hello! \nCHARLIE I have Econ first period. Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices. \nCARA Charrrliiieeeee. \nCHARLIE \n(KILLING HIM) Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal. Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out. \nCARA Thank you, Jesus. Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting. \nAMY You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain. \nCHARLIE Brain? I -- what? No, I'm-- But she's already walking away. \nAMY Five minutes. He watches her move off, anxious and smitten. \nEXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH -- COURTYARD -- DAY \nCharlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream and the works. \nKids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy takes Charlie's arm. \nAMY On time. You stress too much. \nCHARLIE I wasn't worried. \nAMY You were doing your worried thing. \nCHARLIE I was? I have a -- what's my-- \nMARK (O.S.) Ladies! A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other students as they move through the courtyard. The cool kids. \n", "test1_true": "MARK (to Charlie/re: drink) Seriously? A Mochachino? You can't ride with the girls anymore. You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony? Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it. \nBEE (takes his arm) Chuck's secure, aren't you? We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design. It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure. \nCHARLIE Puce. \nBEN Fuck yeah. \nAMY \n(TO CHARLIE) I have track after school, maybe we can hook up later? \nCHARLIE Yeah. Hey. Come here. (pulls her aside/awkward) You know, the formal. Don't think I wasn't going to ask you, because I thought it was an obvious go. Together. Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal. You and me. \nAMY \n(NOT UNKIND) Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to the dance senior year. She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath. \nCHARLIE Right. I knew that. MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow. Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie: \nMARK Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man? Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods? How do you get that? \nCHARLIE Game, my friend. Rock solid. Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a bitch. Mark calls after him-- \nMARK You don't even have a car! \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nLater. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY. \nTEACHER Ben Wegner? \nBEN Here. \nTEACHER Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Adam? (marks chart/then) Courtney Heuer? A girl raises her hand. Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him. EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been picked on by bullies his whole life. He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Nick Straley? \n(NOTHING) Nick? Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly at him. Like -- \"you know and I know...\" Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him. \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nCharlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively. \nMARK Miss Granada. Geometry. \nCHARLIE Holy crap. Where did you get that? \nMARK She's hard up, man. Equations don't keep you warm at night. They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt. \nBEN I think \"it's\" going to talk to us. \nED \n(TO CHARLIE) I need a minute. \nMARK \"It's\" going to talk to Brewster. \nBEN \n", "test1_id": 1605, "test2_input": "INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAWN \nJerry turns at the noise. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN \nCharlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE. \nEXT. JERRY HOUSE -- DAWN \nThe sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with gratitude and relief, manages-- \nDORIS Thank you, thank you... Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them. \nCHARLIE Doris? In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes. \nCHARLIE REACTS Horrified. In shock. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN \nJerry moves into the kitchen. \nThe back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly. And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's sneakers. Jerry takes this in, coldly furious. \nFADE TO: \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DAWN \nCharlie sits on his bed -- still in a state of shock. This shit is for real. Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters. \nJANE You're going to be late. Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell. \nJANE (CONT'D) The hours you keep. It's like living with a vampire. Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea. \nCHARLIE Listen -- promise me -- that guy next door, Jerry? Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house. He's dangerous. \nJANE I think I can handle myself. \nCHARLIE No, no you can't-- \nJANE CHARLIE Charlie-- Don't even look in his direction, understand? And at night, you stay inside. \nJANE Because he's dangerous. What kind of dangerous? Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt. \nCHARLIE Can you trust me? For once, don't ask a million questions-- \nJANE Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman-- \nCHARLIE \n(GENUINE) I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We just don't have time for a big thing! I'm telling you-- \nJANE That's enough. I'm done with this conversation. She moves away. \nCHARLIE Mom! Mom-- But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried. \nEXT./INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nLater. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world. \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- LIBRARY -- DAY \nCLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN As various pages pop up-- \n", "test2_true": "ON CHARLIE As he scrolls and frantically scribbles notes. \nCLOSE ON CHARLIE'S NOTE PAD/COMPUTER SCREEN As Charlie notes tons of CONTRADICTORY facts; \nVamps must avoid all daylight. Vamps can walk in fog or twilight. Vamps always sleep in the dirt. Vamps never sleep. Vamps can only die from stake through the heart. Vamps only die from Fire. Three bites to turn a victim into a vamp. One bite and the victim has to feed from the vamp... Vamps change form -- bats, animals, etc. Vamps absolutely can NOT shape-shift. \nON CHARLIE We see now that he's on a computer in the SCHOOL LIBRARY, isolated behind some stacks. He clicks a link on one of the sites -- which leads him to PETER VINCENT'S website. It's an elaborate interactive site. It says that Vincent is a serious student of all things occult -- especially VAMPIRES -- and has amassed a vast collection of books and artifacts. It also claims that there are different TRIBES of vampires. \nON CHARLIE'S NOTEBOOK He writes in big letters \nTRIBES? \nPETER VINCENT -- VAMP EXPERT? \nAMY (O.S.) Hey. Charlie looks up. Amy stands over him, a little wary. Charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen. He looks like hell. Disheveled, sleep deprived, tense. \nCHARLIE Hey... \nAMY You weren't in class. What are you working on? \nCHARLIE Porn. Hacked it. \nAMY Oh, good. I thought it was something creepy. Charlie nods. Smiles wanly. Then-- \nCHARLIE Look, I'd better... \nAMY Get back to your porn. Got it. She looks away, losing patience. Charlie rallies. \nCHARLIE No. Sorry. I'm just -- I could use some coffee. She looks back. Okay. \nEXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- QUAD -- DAY \nCharlie and Amy sit in the busy quad. \nCHARLIE We can't hang out at my house any more. My mom's flipping out about some stuff. I can see you at school, but for a while -- \nAMY Why? What's going on? \nCHARLIE It's hard to explain. Just... What can he say? He has to protect her, but how? BEN AND MARK Join them. Notice how tweaked Charlie looks. \nBEN You look like dog shit. \nCHARLIE Thanks. \nMARK Your pal the spaz, his folks were here earlier. It's a big thing. \nCHARLIE What? Why? \nMARK I don't know. He ran away or something. They were all upset, talking to the principal. \nBEN One less tweaker clogging up the halls. Charlie stands, upset. \nCHARLIE Shut up. \nMARK BEN Charlie-- Chill out- \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) You don't know what you're talking about. He could be dead for all you know. Mark steps in. Calming, reasonable. \nMARK You're right. Not cool. You're worried and it's totally understandable. \n(THEN) But he's better off, man. He'll be happier with the other trolls on the shire. That's it. Charlie DECKS MARK. They go to the ground and Charlie lets loose on him. A bunch of other guys pull them apart amid shouts, etc. Mark is bloodied and freaked. \n", "test2_id": 1606, "test3_input": "JANE This is ridiculous-- \nJERRY Jane. It's Jerry from next door-- \nCHARLIE I'm telling you, don't answer it! \nJANE This is my house. I'll answer the door if I want to. She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her way, desperate. \nCHARLIE Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And I have proof. Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door-- \nJERRY (O.S.) Jane? I need to talk to you. \nJANE Just-- Hold on! \nJERRY (O.S.) Now. Your son is harassing me! He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely. \nJANE Charlie. What's happening? \nCHARLIE Whatever he says, don't-- \nJERRY (O.S.) He broke into my house. I'd rather not take this to the authorities. But I will! He's sick, deluded-- \nCHARLIE Mom. A tense beat... Finally-- \nJANE \n(YELLS/ANGRY) Get the authorities! My son is a good kid! Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation passes between Charlie and Jane. \nON JERRY As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold. He disappears into the dark. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie races to a window. SEES JERRY MOVE out of sight. \nCHARLIE Shit, shit... \nJANE What? What is he doing? \nCHARLIE Whatever it is, it's not good. \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nJerry stands back, intense. He's got to take care of this problem NOW. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie's running from window to window now, trying to see what's going on. \nCHARLIE Just -- if we stay in here -- he has to give up.

BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nCLOSE ON JERRY As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and swift. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie hands Amy and Jane both CROSSES on CHAINS. \nCHARLIE Take these. Put them on. Just do it. \nJANE \n(HUMORING HIM) Okaaaay. Vampire protection! \nAMY I don't think this is funny. But she puts it on. \nEXT. BREWSTER BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nJerry pulls up the NATURAL GAS LINE that leads to the BREWSTER'S HOUSE. He SAWS IT OPEN AND LIGHTS THE END ON \nFIRE. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM/VARIOUS -- NIGH \nHisssssssssss. A strange sounds coming from under the floor. \nAMY \nWHAT'S THA-- BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE WATER HEATER ALL EXPLODE at once!! WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging them to the ground. The room starts to BURN. Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the fire out, but it's no use. Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT: Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His expression dark. Through the flames he says-- \nJERRY Don't need an invitation if there's no house. A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the house. \nINT/EXT. BREWSTER GARAGE/STREET - NIGHT \ny, Charlie and Jane race into the garage \nAMY I can drive-- \nJANE I drive! They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener-- \nCHARLIE Gun it Mom! Go!!! Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it. She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk as she takes off. Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!

JANE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nJANE What did we do!? What does he want!? They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head off. \nAMY \nHOLY-- Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning wildly in the back seat. \nCHARLIE Amy! Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it YANKS part of her hair out.

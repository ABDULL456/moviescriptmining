{"train": "FRIGHT NIGHT \nWritten by \nMarti Noxon \nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT \nFADE UP: Moving through a tract development. The houses are like Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just mixed differently. A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern emerges... Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and pizza joint flyers. Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town. A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence: \nVOICE (O.S.) Defy reason. Defy everything you know. Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT \nInside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The living room is empty, but the TV's on. \nON THE TELEVISION A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution, he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie imagery. Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man. \nTELEVISION ANNOUNCER Peter Vincent's \"FRIGHT NIGHT.\" The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box. \nTELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Something's moving in the dark. \nAlso on the table -- a role-playing game in progress. \"Magic, the Gathering\"... Elves and Wizards. \nTELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly Wednesday Through Sunday. Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT coming from another room. \nDISTANT VOICE Get off her!! More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly domestic scene. We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes toward us. He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind terror. We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping. We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it. We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered, as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the wall, which Adam nearly falls over. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse - - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed. Blood on pale pink sheets. ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd hidden under the bed. ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the gun. It's just beyond his grasp. \nADAM Come on, come on, come on... He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry. \nADAM (CONT'D) Come on, come on! He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking hands. THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over \nHIM -- Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin... Human but not quite. Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead. HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear: \nDISC JOCKEY (O.S.) .we're looking at a nice day here in Clark County, hitting a season low of only 89 degrees... \nEXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY \nMUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before. In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even. Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat. \nDISC JOCKEY (O.S.) .so get out there and enjoy this beautiful Wednesday, people. We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the rear window. The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so foreboding now. We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT. In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked Pleasure Island. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCLOSE ON: The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street. WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out. \nCHARLIE (to the bike/pissed) You want me to take you apart, huh? Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who just recently came into his body and good looks. He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (still talking to bike) I will. I'll sell you for parts. Don't think I won't-- Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to the curb. She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike, amused. \nDORIS Nothing doing, huh? \nCHARLIE The thing's got no ambition. (re: trash cans) Can I -- uh, give you a hand? \nDORIS I got it. Thanks. She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word \"LUCKY\" across the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb. \nJANE Don't leer at the neighbors, kid. Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb. \nHe and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship which has only recently started to have more edge. \nJERRY Sorry about the mess, man. I was just telling your mom I'll have the dumpster gone next week. \nCHARLIE Doesn't bother me. \nJANE Jerry does night construction on the strip. \nJERRY (noticing Charlie's shoes) You play ball? I'm always looking for a pick up game. \nCHARLIE \n(BLUFFING) Now and then, you know. \nJANE It's more of a collector thing. The shoes. He's obsessed. (to Jerry/\"those teens\") They sleep on sidewalks to get them. Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me. \nJERRY Well -- they're bold. I like them. Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious. \nJERRY (CONT'D) So... I'd ask you guys inside, but it's a mess. I've been meaning to. \nJANE Be neighborly. \nJERRY A drink, something. It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Soon, okay? \nJANE You bet. And thank you so much. For the help. \nJERRY Least I could do. Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed. \nAMY Why did you blow him off? Oh my God! \nJANE A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player. \nCHARLIE \n(IMPRESSED) Mom. Breaking it down. \nJANE I've had enough man trouble. I'm not getting suckered again. Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices. \nJANE (CONT'D) Don't listen to me. Jaded old \nBROAD-- \nCHARLIE \nMOM-- Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it. \nON THE PHONE A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED \"KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!\" It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger, prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights. The text message says \"10 MINUTES -- OR THIS IS GOING WIDE!\" \nON CHARLIE \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (alarmed/to Amy) Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry. Call you later. \nAMY Now? \nJANE I have dinner on-- \nCHARLIE I gotta go. I'll eat later. \nJANE Charlie! \nBut Charlie's already off and running. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK \n(MORE) \nED (CONT'D) And that's you guys at the center, see? His windows are totally \nBLACKED OUT-- \nCHARLIE There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip-- \nED But every window? No. I've been watching him. It all fits-- \nCHARLIE That Jerry's a Dracula. \nED No. Dracula is a specific vampire. \nI'M SAYING-- \nCHARLIE I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight-- \nED Fiction, okay? This is real. A real monster. And he's not brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble. He's the fucking shark from JAWS. He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead. \n(MOST EMPHATIC) And that book SUCKS. Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real. But he shakes it off. \nCHARLIE \nCOME ON-- \nED What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you? \nCHARLIE Yeah, in San Diego like a month ago! \nED Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation. \nCHARLIE No, but-- \nED Your mom? Lonely divorcee... \nCHARLIE You're on drugs. \nED No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd take my word, but I have evidence at home. Hard evidence. Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Okay. \nED \n(INTENSE) We have to stake him in his nest. You and me. Not now, it's dark. \nCHARLIE Right. Cause he's nocturnal. \nED Just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now-- \nCHARLIE Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight-- \nED \nSIXTEEN-- \nCHARLIE \n(LOSING IT) Whatever! I grew up, okay? You don't want to, fine. But don't get an attitude because I'd rather have a life than make shit up! Ed stops. Stung. \nED Right. Got it. You're soooo cool \"Brewster.\" Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers. This is the pinnacle for them. And that includes your girl-- \nCHARLIE Shut up. \nAs he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a long chain. JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat. Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard. \nEXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nEd races for the back gate-- \nAND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP. Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing. Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking on it, the cross directly under his neck. JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the cross into the neighbor's POOL. Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair. Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's chilling. \nJERRY Bit off more than you can chew. Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE. \nED We'll see, man. I know my shit. But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with actual sympathy. \nJERRY Really? Who's going to believe you? You see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone? Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on. \nED Don't play that stuff. That mind crap. Come on -- try me. Try me! \nJERRY You say you're glad you're different. But how can you be in a place like this? These people... Even your best friend. You're nothing to him now. Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less conviction. \nED Get back! \nJERRY It can be over. I can make all that pain go away. Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone. \nED No... \nJERRY You were born for this and you know it. Your \"life\", what you had? That's the illusion. (off Ed's silence) I can take you somewhere great. Somewhere you'll belong. Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope? \nJERRY (CONT'D) It's a gift. And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nFADE UP ON: \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- DAY \nA new day. Sunny and hot. A truck moves the DUMPSTER from Jerry's house. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAY \nThrough the kitchen window, Jane watches the DUMPSTER drive away. She's pleased, a little surprised. Says to herself... \nJANE Good on his word. A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in. \nAMY Morning. Charlie? \nJANE You try. My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear. \nAMY \nCHARLIE! \nCHARLIE (O.S.) Coming! Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the island. Grins a little. \nAMY Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You should facebook him. \nJANE (shakes her head) Temptress. I'm resolved. Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated. pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts. \nAMY Oversleep? \nCHARLIE Didn't. (off her look) Weird dreams. Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out. \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- DAY \nAmy and Charlie head to the car. Charlie turns -- looks back at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows... \nCHARLIE Oh, I -- you don't have to-- Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand. \nRICK Ed said you'd sprouted. And you're, the-- Rick awkwardly gestures around his face. \nCHARLIE Cleared up. Yes sir-- \nVICTORIA Ed will be so sorry he missed you, But -- you should both be in school now, shouldn't you? \nCHARLIE He's not here? Did you see him today? \nRICK He's usually up and out early. Everything okay? \nCHARLIE No, sure. We're working on a class project. I guess we crossed paths. \nVICTORIA I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed, he'd be mad that I said so, but he talks about you all the time. This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been. \nCHARLIE Yeah. That's... He's great. \n(THEN) Would it be okay if I went upstairs? Ed has a book we need. \nVICTORIA Of course. Make yourself at home. Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick -- \"that's good!\" They're both pleased. \nINT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY \nEd's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy movies. There's an art table where Ed has been working on some illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops and looks at them. They're fantastic. He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends. \nCLOSE ON A PHOTO Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not. \nON CHARLIE Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees-- PETER VINCENT'S \"FRIGHT NIGHT\" POSTER on a wall. Charlie takes it in, laughs a little. Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore printed off the internet, books, etc. If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more of Ed's fictional world. Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head. It's all a fantasy -- nothing more. \nCHARLIE This is crazy. He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on -- and one file stands out. \"THE JERRY DIARIES.\" Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds a bunch of Quicktime files. He opens one. Stops. \nCLOSE ON COMPUTER \nAs BLURRY short clips play: Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING \nIT. DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody. Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on video. \nOFF CHARLIE Taking this in. Chilled. \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- NIGHT \nIt's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's house as he searches for his keys. BAM -- he walks right into JERRY. \nJERRY Hey guy. Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed thought? Impossible, but... \nCHARLIE Hey. Guy. \nJERRY You could really do me a solid. \nCHARLIE Yeah? What kind. \nJERRY I have a girl on her way over for a beer, and I'm totally out of beer. They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the kitchen. \nCHARLIE Bummer. \nJERRY Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you. \nCHARLIE Uh, yeah, sure. \nJerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door. This is when Charlie should invite him in. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Let me see what Mom's got. She's kind of a \"light domestic\".. .mom. Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter. Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in, uninvited, Ed's theory is blown. \nCHARLIE Believeme when I say--thereis nothing in the worldI'dratherdo \nBUT-- \nAMY Charlie. Don't be nervous. She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait... Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God-- DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie stops. Practically tosses Amy off him. \nCHARLIE You hear that? He rushes to the window. Looks outside. \nCHARLIE'S POV DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Shit. \nAMY What? JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's flirting up a storm. \nCHARLIE Shit, shit, shit-- Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs. \nAMY He's hot. She's a stripper. They were bound to find each other. \nCHARLIE \nGO-GO DANCER-- \nAMY Take away two tiny pieces of cloth, stripper. \n(LIGHTLY) You jealous? \nCHARLIE What? No-- Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT CHARLIE. It's chilling. Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling her down too. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) He looked right at us. \nAMY Maybe. Not a big deal-- Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE. \nCHARLIE No, it is a big. A very big. He saw us and he was pissed. \nAMY Okay... Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically. \nAMY (CONT'D) If you're not into this, say so. Don't do me any favors. \nCHARLIE What? No! I am, I totally am. just -- I don't trust that guy. He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff. \nAMY I'm going. \nCHARLIE Amy. Don't-- \nAMY No. You've got your neighborhood watch thing. \nCHARLIE Come on, don't be that way-- But she's gone. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Crap! A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention. He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts. Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up. Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE. Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry. \nFADE TO: \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nLater. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window. He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like they are coming from Jerry's. But are they screams of pleasure or pain? Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam. Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window. Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off. Off Charlie, unsettled. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nA short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter gloves. He looks at his iPhone. ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. \"How to pick a lock.\" \nCharlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes he has no idea what he's doing. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAWN \nJerry turns at the noise. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN \nCharlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE. \nEXT. JERRY HOUSE -- DAWN \nThe sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with gratitude and relief, manages-- \nDORIS Thank you, thank you... Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them. \nCHARLIE Doris? In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes. \nCHARLIE REACTS Horrified. In shock. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN \nJerry moves into the kitchen. \nThe back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly. And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's sneakers. Jerry takes this in, coldly furious. \nFADE TO: \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DAWN \nCharlie sits on his bed -- still in a state of shock. This shit is for real. Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters. \nJANE You're going to be late. Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell. \nJANE (CONT'D) The hours you keep. It's like living with a vampire. Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea. \nCHARLIE Listen -- promise me -- that guy next door, Jerry? Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house. He's dangerous. \nJANE I think I can handle myself. \nCHARLIE No, no you can't-- \nJANE CHARLIE Charlie-- Don't even look in his direction, understand? And at night, you stay inside. \nJANE Because he's dangerous. What kind of dangerous? Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt. \nCHARLIE Can you trust me? For once, don't ask a million questions-- \nJANE Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman-- \nCHARLIE \n(GENUINE) I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We just don't have time for a big thing! I'm telling you-- \nJANE That's enough. I'm done with this conversation. She moves away. \nCHARLIE Mom! Mom-- But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried. \nEXT./INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nLater. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world. \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- LIBRARY -- DAY \nCLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN As various pages pop up-- \nMARK (CONT'D) What the fuck man!? AMY stands back, appalled. \nAMY Charlie!! What the hell is wrong with you?! \nCHARLIE \n(TO MARK) You're an idiot, you know that? \n(SUPER EMPHATIC) And it's HOBBITS on the shire! \nCharlie turns to Amy-- \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Come on. But she shakes her head and moves to MARK and BEN. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) \nAMY-- \nAMY Just get out of here, Charlie. Go. He knows it's over. Heartbroken, he takes off. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. THE STRIP -- DAY \nCharlie gets off the bus and walks toward one of the nicer hotels. He's looking at another \"how to\" on his phone. \"How to meet a celebrity.\" \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY \nCLOSE ON -- A NEWSPAPER STAND As Charlie grabs a LAS VEGAS SUN from a rack. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY -- ELEVATOR -- DAY \nCharlie watches a bunch of CONVENTIONEERS with BADGES in the \nFOOD COURT. A guy about Charlie's size leaves his coat and badge on his chair -- goes to get his food. Charlie sweeps in and quietly takes it. \nINT. HOTEL SHOWROOM -- DAY \nCLOSE ON \nPETER VINCENT 40's, but all wiry rock n' roll attitude. Leather pants and tattoos, Long black hair wrapped in a bandana. Dark painted nails and heavy eye make-up. HEAVY METAL MUSIC BLARES. \nThe whole scene is OVER THE TOP GOTH cheesiness. Lots of stage effects and fire... PAMELA ANDERSON look-alikes in skimpy outfits prance on stage as another SEXY GIRL is handcuffed, S&M style, to a CIRCULAR \nTORTURE BOARD. \nON THE AUDIENCE We see that this is a run-through. Tech guys work light boards, etc. A director and scattered others sit in the seats. \nCHARLIE Sneaks in one of the back doors. Silently moves close to the stage. He's WEARING THE STOLEN COAT. The badge holder now has the SUN masthead logo inside. It looks, at first glance, like a legit credential. \nON STAGE Peter reveals a tray full of SHARP DAGGERS. He raises them to the audience. \nPETER The knives are real. He CUTS his OWN PALM with one, bleeds. Doesn't even wince. Stud. \nPETER (CONT'D) The girl is real. He GRABS HER, feels her up. She giggles. \nSEXY ASSISTANT Ooooo! Peter YANKS down on the circular board the assistant's tied to -- sending her SPINNING. \nPETER And if I miss, she'll really be dead. The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in the board behind her, this close where her head was. She screams! Breaks character. \nSEXY ASSISTANT Holy Shit! Pete! Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S \nACCENT. \nJANE This is ridiculous-- \nJERRY Jane. It's Jerry from next door-- \nCHARLIE I'm telling you, don't answer it! \nJANE This is my house. I'll answer the door if I want to. She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her way, desperate. \nCHARLIE Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And I have proof. Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door-- \nJERRY (O.S.) Jane? I need to talk to you. \nJANE Just-- Hold on! \nJERRY (O.S.) Now. Your son is harassing me! He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely. \nJANE Charlie. What's happening? \nCHARLIE Whatever he says, don't-- \nJERRY (O.S.) He broke into my house. I'd rather not take this to the authorities. But I will! He's sick, deluded-- \nCHARLIE Mom. A tense beat... Finally-- \nJANE \n(YELLS/ANGRY) Get the authorities! My son is a good kid! Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation passes between Charlie and Jane. \nON JERRY As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold. He disappears into the dark. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie races to a window. SEES JERRY MOVE out of sight. \nCHARLIE Shit, shit... \nJANE What? What is he doing? \nCHARLIE Whatever it is, it's not good. \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- NIGHT \nJerry stands back, intense. He's got to take care of this problem NOW. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie's running from window to window now, trying to see what's going on. \nCHARLIE Just -- if we stay in here -- he has to give up. He can't get in without an invitation. \nAMY \nOH-- \n(GETTING IT) Oh... Really? Like a-- \nCHARLIE Vampire. Really. Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy. \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT \nJerry carries a SHOVEL and A SMALL SAW. He stalks into the Brewster's backyard, where he's hidden from the street. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nTHEY SWERVE OUT THE SHADOW HILLS GATES \nEXT. MAJOR STREET -- NIGHT \nJane speeds down the street, which is wide and not heavily trafficked here. Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT. JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S. \nAMY My brother has a gun! \nCHARLIE Good to know! Is he here?! \nJANE Call the police! Anybody-- Jane manages to evade Jerry until -- The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS THEM. Jane screeches to a halt. \nJANE (CONT'D) Oh hell. In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them. \nCHARLIE GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go-- Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS \nTHE CAR AT JERRY. \nJANE Charlie!! They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car. \nJANE (CONT'D) Oh my God!! Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD. \nAMY Are you nuts!? You can't kill that guy! \nCHARLIE You have no idea. \n(TO JANE) It's him or us. Mom. MOM. Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth. Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Where is he? Where'd he go? Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car. BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under Jane's feet. Jane and Amy SCREAM! \nCLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK. No pupil. Freaky. He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car, where he's clinging -- face up. The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face. His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK. It's shocking, horrible. \nON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away at his clothes and flesh. He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt. ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN. JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and metal. \nA GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning steel as everyone assesses the damage. \nAMY Oh... Are you-- Jane? Jane is woozy. Hurt. \nCHARLIE Mom? \nJANE I'm okay... Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside, a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car-- \nFAMILY MAN What the hell do you think you're doing!-- Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent-- \nCHARLIE NO! Hey man, stay in your-- But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry, hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S \nCAR. In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family man's NECK OUT. \nCLOSE ON MINIVAN As those \"cute\" stick figure family decals are splattered with BLOOD. \nAMY AND JANE Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE. Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the ground. He moves toward them. Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Yeah. Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Get out of here. Run. Run! \nAMY \nBUT-- \nCHARLIE Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt, get out of here! They back off. Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting \nHIM-- \nINT. PETER'S \"MUSEUM\"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT \nPeter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows at the lights of the strip. The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex. \nASSISTANT Bye babe. Good show tonight. He's barely paying attention. \nPETER You were late again on \"The Devil's Torture Chamber.\" But she's gone. A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place. \nAbsently, he sifts through them. Stops. He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA. Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him. He goes to a WALL SAFE. Opens it. Hidden inside are a bunch of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of his mother and father... And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH. Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted. \nINT. HOSPITAL -- JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nCharlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch. Both are scared and regretful. \nCHARLIE This is my fault. \nAMY You didn't make any of it happen. \nCHARLIE Ed came to me. I turned my back on him. \nAMY How were you supposed to believe him? None of it makes sense. \nCHARLIE He did talk a lot of demented crap. (but.. ) He was my best friend. He asked me, begged me, to believe him. \nAMY People change. Everybody-- \nCHARLIE Yeah they do. I turned into a dick. I figured my dweeb past, not big with the ladies. \nAMY \n(WRY) So you're saying this is my fault. \nCHARLIE I wanted you to like me. I tried to erase Ed -- all of it. I know how that feels. \nAMY I knew you were a dweeb. (off his look) You think I want a \"dude\" like Mark or Ben? I like that you're different... It didn't hurt that your skin cleared up. She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then something alarming occurs to Amy: \nAMY (CONT'D) I can't believe we didn't have sex. \nCHARLIE \nAMY- \nAMY No, seriously. I'm going to die a virgin? Me? How did this happen? \nCHARLIE We're not going to die-- \nAMY But what if we do? Let's do it. Now. The bathroom. Charlie. A beat. \nCHARLIE I think we should kill the vampire first. I'll perform much better. They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then: \nAMY Oh my God, Charlie. What are we going to do? \nCHARLIE We're going to fight. Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Hello? \nINNERCUT WITH: \nINT. PETER'S VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- LIBRARY -- NIGHT \nPeter stands with the photo of the insignia in hand. \nPETER I can help you. My place. One hour. \n(ANGUISHED) \nI KNOW-- Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie. \nAMY \nCHARLIE-- \nED You let him turn me into this. At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth. It's terrifying. SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf. \nPETER Stay away, demon. \nED (amused/queens accent) \"Stay awaaaay, demon!\" Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real. \nED (CONT'D) Whatcha got there? Itsy bitsy little stakey? \nPETER Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you. \nED Old school. Nice. Got to get pretty close to use it, though. Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck. HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway. \nED (CONT'D) Uh uh. No you don't. ED BOLTS AFTER PETER. Charlie and Amy race the other way. \nCHARLIE The elevator! \nINT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nPeter pushes a BUTTON on a doorway, bolts into a PANIC ROOM. Ed is on his heels, but JUST MISSES grabbing Peter before the door closes. The POWERFUL DOOR CLOSES ON ED'S ARM, crushes it. ED HOWLS as his arm SEVERS. The door LOCKS. But what doesn't kill him makes him stronger and crazier. \nED A panic room!? You better panic, loser! You better watch your neck! \nINT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT \nPeter's in shock -- watching Ed's severed arm twitch on the floor. \nED (0.S.) Prince of darkness is a little baby man! I love it! All the fat chicks in your fan club are gonna be so bummed! He hears ED flipping out, but ED DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE \nSECURITY SCREEN. \nINT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- ENTRY AREA -- NIGHT \nCharlie runs with Amy to the ELEVATOR. The CONTROL BOX has been ripped from the wall. They're trapped. \nAMY Oh my God, oh my God... Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her. \nCHARLIE Look at me. Stop. \n(SHE DOES) There's another way out of here. And there are a million things to fight with in here. Understand? We're going to make it. Amy pulls herself together. Nods. They RUN. \nINT. PETER'S \"MUSEUM\" LIBRARY -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT \nCHARLIE AND AMY race through the ROOMS of Peter's extensive collection. \nINNERCUT WITH ED Tracking them -- not far behind, his stub of an arm bleeding and HEALING as he goes. \nED Give it up, Chuck! You're dead. \n(THEN) If you hadn't ended up such a dick, I might have tricked you out. We could have rocked this evil shit! But you blew it. Nothing but the big dirt nap for you and your lady. \nAMY AND CHARLIE Round a corner -- it's a dead-end. They see a large antique CONFESSIONAL at one end of the room. \nON ED As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen. \nINT. PETER'S HIGH RISE LOBBY -- NIGHT \nED (O.S.) (CONT'D) Come on! You're not even trying. \nCharlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre, horrible. Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie cries out. \nINT. PETER'S LIBRARY/\"MUSEUM\" -- NIGHT \nAmy can hear Charlie yell. \nAMY Charlie! She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a GUN loaded with silver bullets... \nJERRY You are something, aren't you? Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive. She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!! She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back, but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his shoulder, unimpressed. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Werewolves. Amy FLINGS holy water in his face. JERRY SCREAMS, burns. \nAMY Vampires. She RUNS. \nINT. PETER'S \"MUSEUM\"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT \nED is already starting to heal as he and Charlie continue to fight. But his head still flops hideously to one side. \nED Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles. Hard to cut. Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of the way. \nEd manages to get Charlie in a one-arm embrace of sorts, positions himself so he can BITE HIS NECK. \nED (CONT'D) Is this weird for you too? I feel like such a homo-- Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY smashes ED in the head. Hard. Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden cabinet. Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his shot. But he hesitates. \nAMY Do it. Charlie! Charlie's frozen. Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never. \nED Wow. Bimbo has some juice-- \nAMY Jerry's here. He's coming! \nCHARLIE (to Ed/pained) I'm sorry. WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie with surprise... Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment -- he looks like himself again. \nED I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was his Renfield. Funny if you-- Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR... Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT. Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt. Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room. \nAMY I found the stairs. Come on. \nINT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nJERRY, VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water, sees AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead. He sprints after them. Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT FIGURINE in his path, as well as cabinets, etc... They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead. \nAMY \nOVER HERE-- She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN \nTHE STAIRS. \nINT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT \nPeter sits huddled in a corner, ashamed and shaking. The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms, until it lands on his dead cousin, ARTHUR. It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse. OFF PETER, terrified. \nINT. CASINO -- NIGHT \nAmy and Charlie emerge from the stairway. They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO, which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives. Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved. \nAMY Stop. Stop, I need to-- \nCHARLIE Not now. He's coming for us. \nAMY He can't kill us, not here-- \nCHARLIE Who's going to notice? Who's going to care? Amy, look around-- \nCHARLIE You have to help me. That guy, he's going to kill her, he's a \nKILLER-- The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her neck. \nDOORMAN Yeah? Then she's liking it. Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized. \nCHARLIE You don't understand!-- \nDOORMAN ID. Then you can tell me your whole sad story-- \nCHARLIE No! There's no time-- Amy!! Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the doorman has a good grip, pulls him back. \nJERRY Sees that CHARLIE is restrained. Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) No! NO! \nCHARLIE'S POV As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY. It's a nightmare. Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no helping her. \nFADE TO: \nINT. PETER'S HIGH RISE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nPeter packs a bag, getting out of town. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) I see you got my message. Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway. \nPETER How'd you get in here? \nCHARLIE Security's a little lax. Everybody got their throat ripped out. Peter backs away as Charlie moves in. Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a decade in one night. \nPETER You too? He change you? \nCHARLIE Look at your monitor. PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie \nSHOWS UP ON THE SCREEN. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I don't know if Amy's alive or dead or turned -- but he's got her. My mom may not make it. And Ed... \n(COLD) I'm going to end him, or he's going to end me. \n(MORE) \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) One way or the other, that's how it's going to be and you're going with me. \nPETER Don't you get what this is? There's no fighting. There's only surviving, if you're lucky-- \nCHARLIE You call this surviving? If you live and we all die, you think you'll ever be able to get us out of your head? \nPETER I know I won't. I never could -- not after the first time. This stops Charlie. \nPETER (CONT'D) I told myself I probably made it up. I was a kid. Maybe it was easier to believe in monsters... \nCHARLIE Made what up? \nPETER The vampire who killed my parents, my brothers. But not me. I hid. Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense. Peter continues, haunted-- \nPETER (CONT'D) I didn't collect all this stuff for fun. I thought maybe I could find the tribe, \"avenge\" my people. \nCHARLIE So do it. We'll go in at dawn. He's got to rest sometime-- \nPETER \n(HARD) It's not like that. When I was a kid, I hid because I wanted to live. I still do! This isn't the comics. You want to be a dead hero. Good for you. But I'm out. \nCHARLIE Let's do this shit. He swallows hard, scared but determined. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- FIRST FLOOR -- DAY \nCLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house. The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air. Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken open with the crow bar. \nCharlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting him to jump out and go for his throat... He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY \nCharlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small rooms. Looks in. \nNO AMY Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the door for yet another room. AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her. \nCHARLIE \nAMY-- Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns... And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down. \nAMY \nCHARLIE-- She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional. \nAMY (CONT'D) You shouldn't be here-- \nCHARLIE Where is he? \nAMY I don't know. He dumped me here. I'm bait. He said so-- \nCHARLIE How do you feel? \nAMY I'll survive. Please get out of here. He's too strong-- \nCHARLIE I'm stronger. \n(WAVERING) In a nerd power way. You know... \nHe reaches into his jacket, pulls out a CROSS. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Take this. It should-- He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared. Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic-- \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Amy? Amy!? Nothing. It's like she vaporized. \nINT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- DAY \nCharlie races down a hallway, looking for ANY. He tries door after door that won't open. He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through -- almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion of the house. Jerry's building more cells. Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM! He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER. He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and standing tall. Dressed all in black. \nCHARLIE Shit! You-- \nPETER CHARLIE Sorry-- How'd you-- A beat. Then: \nPETER Guess I don't want to be a man like me either. Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons. And a flask. Peter grins. \nPETER (CONT'D) Let's kill something. \nCHARLIE \n(RE: FLASK) You reek. Midori? \nPETER Don't get greedy. I'm here. \n(THEN/PROUD) And I found something else. From my collection. Powerful shit. From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN with a CROSS MOUNTED ON THE BARREL. \nCHARLIE Wooden bullets? Nice. \nPETER How about we go back to my \"run away\" plan? \nCHARLIE \n(IGNORING HIM) We can't burn Jerry out. There's no way we'll get all these people out if the house goes up. \nPETER I thought you're here for Amy. (off Charlie's look) Great. Right. Save the Geometry-- A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat. They're both petrified as they move toward the door. Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along with the stake. They creep toward the door. \nCLOSE ON CHARLIE Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob... Turns it... WHAMP! -- Charlie's VIOLENTLY SHOVED THROUGH THE DOOR into the STORAGE AREA \nINT. JERRY'S STORAGE AREA -- DAY \nCharlie hits the dirt hard. The door SLAMS SHUT AND LOCKS BEHIND HIM. He's in a smaller room with a LARGE DIRT GRAVE in the middle. Jerry's grave. \nINT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY \nPeter's confronted by JERRY. Who smiles darkly. \nJERRY You look bigger on TV. Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM! But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER \nHURTLING BACKWARD. \nINT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY \nCharlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the grave. He cautiously moves to retrieve it... He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY. Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes, her lips -- all shining and full. Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms. \nCHARLIE Amy, God... She clings to him, near tears. \nAMY Charlie. \nINT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY \nPeter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY -- who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only thing holding him back. \nBLAM! Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY. \nJERRY In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood- curdling yell. It's chilling. \nCLOSE ON GRAVES One by one, the TRIBE of vampires wake. ADAM, MS. GRANADA... \nINT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY \nAmy pulls away from Charlie -- says: \nAMY You should have run with me while we had the chance. You should have saved me, Charlie. \nCharlie takes this in, pained. Then-- \nCHARLIE It's not too late. She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps... \nAMY It is. He's inside me now. Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into Charlie. He feels the change. \nCHARLIE \nAMY-- Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight -- and they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE. \nINT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY \nJERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other vampires, closes in on PETER. \nJERRY It's over, guy. Charlie -- his girl's having her way with him. \n(THEN) She's way out of his league anyway. Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much longer. \n(WEAK) I'm better with stationary targets. \nCHARLIE Yeah you are. Peter looks at him, sad. \nPETER Get out of here. We don't have much time before they dig out. \nCHARLIE \n(RE: STAKE) I can save you. I have to kill him with this. \nPETER You're a brave mother, I get it. And you were right. This is how I had to go... But we didn't count on an army. \nCHARLIE He'll kill you both, he said-- \nPETER We're already dead. \n(THEN) Go now, you live to fight another day. Stay -- there won't be one. Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained. \nPETER (CONT'D) Do it. \nCLOSE ON CHARLIE Accepting it. It's what he has to do. He starts DIGGING. \nPETER (CONT'D) Charlie! But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN over his face again. \nPETER (CONT'D) Stop! \nWHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie. Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the rubble. Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now \nPETER (CONT'D) Charlie! Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help. Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle. Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames. Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE. \nCHARLIE \nNO! A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to burn away. \nHE STAKES JERRY. AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it seems. The vampire is being burned out of her. PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain. \nJERRY Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in his CHEST. Right through the heart. He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR. For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air... \nJERRY Blow me. \nTHEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES. \nON CHARLIE AND PETER \nThinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in flames. They tumble into one of the open graves. DIRT pours in around them, extinguishing the fire. \nON AMY Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the edge of the open grave. \nABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned, unconscious. \nAMY Charlie! She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms. \nAMY (CONT'D) Charlie... Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally, Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly... \nCHARLIE Blow me? Seriously? Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Those are his last words? What a tool. We pull away, leaving this tableau... UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked. A beat. \nMS. GRANADA Let's agree to never talk about this. \nFADE TO: \nINT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "ON JANE Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit. \nINT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAY \nThe Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban paradise. Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed. Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty, and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a sneakerhead, a serious collector. \nBEE Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck. \nAMY Charlie. \nBEE Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck? Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort. \nCHARLIE It's -- they're not -- that's, like, puce? That's a macho puce. \nCARA Can you stop someplace? I'm severely under-caffeinated. \nAMY (ignores her/to Bee) Did you see the poster for the formal? The theme is \"Hope\"? \nBEE I know. They asked me to be on the committee again but I was like -- hope is completely 2008. Grow up. \nCHARLIE Did you suggest \"Despair?\" Nobody would see that coming. Or -- global warming? Everybody has to wear tin foil. \nAMY (laughs/to Charlie) Did you go last year? We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me. \nCHARLIE \n(LIES) Me? I, ah, was in training that week. This big triatha-- \nBEE (cutting him off) Chuck was still under his rock. We're so glad you crawled out. \nCARA Caffeine!? Hello! \nCHARLIE I have Econ first period. Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices. \nCARA Charrrliiieeeee. \nCHARLIE \n(KILLING HIM) Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal. Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out. \nCARA Thank you, Jesus. Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting. \nAMY You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain. \nCHARLIE Brain? I -- what? No, I'm-- But she's already walking away. \nAMY Five minutes. He watches her move off, anxious and smitten. \nEXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH -- COURTYARD -- DAY \nCharlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream and the works. \nKids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy takes Charlie's arm. \nAMY On time. You stress too much. \nCHARLIE I wasn't worried. \nAMY You were doing your worried thing. \nCHARLIE I was? I have a -- what's my-- \nMARK (O.S.) Ladies! A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other students as they move through the courtyard. The cool kids. \n", "test1_true": "MARK (to Charlie/re: drink) Seriously? A Mochachino? You can't ride with the girls anymore. You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony? Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it. \nBEE (takes his arm) Chuck's secure, aren't you? We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design. It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure. \nCHARLIE Puce. \nBEN Fuck yeah. \nAMY \n(TO CHARLIE) I have track after school, maybe we can hook up later? \nCHARLIE Yeah. Hey. Come here. (pulls her aside/awkward) You know, the formal. Don't think I wasn't going to ask you, because I thought it was an obvious go. Together. Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal. You and me. \nAMY \n(NOT UNKIND) Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to the dance senior year. She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath. \nCHARLIE Right. I knew that. MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow. Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie: \nMARK Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man? Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods? How do you get that? \nCHARLIE Game, my friend. Rock solid. Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a bitch. Mark calls after him-- \nMARK You don't even have a car! \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nLater. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY. \nTEACHER Ben Wegner? \nBEN Here. \nTEACHER Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Adam? (marks chart/then) Courtney Heuer? A girl raises her hand. Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him. EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been picked on by bullies his whole life. He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Nick Straley? \n(NOTHING) Nick? Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly at him. Like -- \"you know and I know...\" Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him. \nINT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY \nCharlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively. \nMARK Miss Granada. Geometry. \nCHARLIE Holy crap. Where did you get that? \nMARK She's hard up, man. Equations don't keep you warm at night. They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt. \nBEN I think \"it's\" going to talk to us. \nED \n(TO CHARLIE) I need a minute. \nMARK \"It's\" going to talk to Brewster. \nBEN \n", "test1_id": 1605, "test2_input": "(TO ED) When are you going to get the message? We don't know you-- \nED \n(RE: CHARLIE) He does. Or did. Before the summer and his Jock Lobotomy. \nCHARLIE (to Ed/uncomfortable) What's the deal, man? \nED Alone. Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out laughing. Mark looks at Charlie. \nMARK Just the two of you. That's sweet. He can school you in the ways of geek-douchery. \nED It's important. \"Brewster.\" The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch with interest -- out of earshot. Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack. \nED (CONT'D) Adam's missing. Charlie's looking around, self-conscious. \nCHARLIE What do you mean, he's missing? \nED I keep trying him -- nothing. No texts, no phone. And he's not the only one who's gone. You heard roll call. \nCHARLIE So kids aren't coming to school. What do you want me to do about it? \nED Meet me at his house after school. We'll check around. See what's up, if he's okay. \nCHARLIE I can't after school. I'm busy. \nED I don't think you get what I'm \nTELLING YOU-- \nCHARLIE Look, do we have to do this here? Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He starts to lose it, raises his voice-- \nED What, am I not even suppose to speak to you now?-- \nCHARLIE Keep it down. Don't spaz-- \nED It's so horrible! Crossing the streams! Will High School as we know it cease to exist?! Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance. \nED (CONT'D) You want me to tell your pals how well we know each other? The Lego contests, the Farscape conventions, \nTHE COSTUMES-- \nCHARLIE \nUIET-- \nED Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine-- \nCHARLIE No. No. \nED Then be my backup. \nCHARLIE \n(DEFEATED) Fine. Adam's after school. \nED Don't be late. Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He shrugs like \"I have no idea what that was about...\" \nFADE TO: \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK \nThe sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out, right before dark. Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field clothes. Looks tough. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE You're eating right now, you know. As you speak. You literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it-- \nAMY \n(LAUGHS) I ran six miles. What did you do? \nCHARLIE I -- watched you. But not in a creepy way. Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy. \nAMY So don't judge. You don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do you? Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her. \nAMY (CONT'D) What was that for? \nCHARLIE I don't know you're just... \nAMY What? \nCHARLIE \n(PERFECT) Nothing. A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real. They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE... A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face. Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he FIXES their sprinkler. PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis. \nAMY Wow. \nCHARLIE Look at Mom. She's\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \nAMY Damn right. If he followed her home, you have to let her keep him. Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment. \nEXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK \nED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone. He finally dials in a number. Talks-- \nADAM Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's. Remember the videos we all made back when? You and me and Adam, bro? In tights. Want your pals to get a load of that? \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK \nAmy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear-- \nJANE .so not a pool, what's the work you're doing? \nJerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm. \nJERRY Foundation problems. I had to rip up half the basement. \nJANE These houses were built practically overnight. I'm never surprised when they come apart. \nJERRY \n(RE: SPRINKLER) Done. Just needed a new stem. Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping. \nJANE Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And his -- do we say girlfriend now? \nCHARLIE \n(EMBARRASSED) I guess. I mean -- only if she's-- Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him. \nAMY (shakes Jerry's hand) Hi. I'm Amy. He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie. Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit. \nCHARLIE Hey. \nJANE Jerry's our new neighbor. The Perry place. He's \"handy.\" \nAMY (looks to Charlie, smiles) No kidding. \n", "test2_id": 1606, "test3_input": "CHARLIE Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want to kill one. But really. How how would you do it? \nPETER Depends. You got fire, beheading. Or go classic -- stake through the heart. Bam! \nCHARLIE So all that actually works? \nPETER How the fuck do I know. \nCHARLIE I thought you're-- \nPETER I read books, man. You think I'm hanging out with Dracula and the Easter Bunny? \nCHARLIE Sorry. No. Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I -- I have a personal interest in this story. (off Peter's look) A friend's missing, actually. I think one of them got him. \nPETER Them, meaning a \"vampire.\" \nCHARLIE Jerry. He lives next door to me. \nPETER \"Jerry?\" \nCHARLIE I know. \n(THEN) But it's no joke. If you look at these clips, you'll see. They take some time to load but... Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his pocket. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) And I printed up some photos I took. In his place. Or lair... Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table. Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed. \nPETER Arthur! \nCHARLIE No, come on, I'm-- \nPETER You're a nutjob. Arthur! Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again. \nCHARLIE Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him kill a girl. She burned up in my hands. You have to tell me how to stop him. Arthur enters. \nPETER Get this loser out of my sight. \nCHARLIE I know what I saw. \nPETER No you don't. See this guy? He gestures to ARTHUR. \nPETER (CONT'D) My cousin, Art. He's \"me\" on stage. That's how I teleport. People see what they want to see. \nCHARLIE \n(URGENT) This is what you've been looking for, I promise. I can take you to him, to his place. \nPETER In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed of supernatural activity. \nCHARLIE Yes! It's genius. A transient population. A town where people work all night, sleep all day... \nPETER A town full of con-artists. (not buying it) No. You're working me, or somebody's working you. Charlie's getting angry now. \nCHARLIE He already got my friend! I know how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I didn't want this. I don't want to know this. Just tell me what to do! Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens. \nPETER Run. \nCHARLIE What? \nPETER You heard me. He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to ARTHUR, nods. \nCHARLIE So I save my own skin so he can keep killing!? I won't. We have to kill him! Please!-- Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him. \n", "test3_true": "Charlie stands, shut out. What the hell is he going to do now? \nFADE TO: \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE/JERRY'S HOUSE -- DUSK \nMoving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed. Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC. Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long rope of the stuff. His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DUSK \nNow we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti- vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other religious pictures, etc. Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE. A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time. Another knock. \nCHARLIE What? Jane walks in. Takes in the decor. \nJANE The whole house looks like that show Dark Shadows. \nCHARLIE It's a gag. For Amy. Long story. \nJANE (takes this in/then) You like her a lot, don't you? A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods. Jane's disappointed. Then-- \nJANE (CONT'D) Don't use tape on the walls. \n(THEN) Oh. Ed's parents left a few messages, looking for him. Charlie looks up at this. Pained. \nCHARLIE Okay. He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then she starts to go. \nTHE DOORBELL RINGS. Before Jane can really react, Charlie pushes past her. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) DON'T. Don't open it. \nINT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DUSK \nCharlie races downstairs. Stops. AMY is standing in the living room. \nCHARLIE How'd you get in?! \nAMY It was unlocked. \nCHARLIE MOM! You have to lock the door! \nAMY Okay, whatever, listen. You're flipping out. Punching out your friends and blowing everything off and is that a stake? A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his back. \nCHARLIE No. Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room is decked in more anti-vamp decor. \nAMY Look. Even if you're losing it -- you don't get to blow me off. You don't go from something to nothing overnight. \n(EMOTIONAL) You're not nothing to me, Charlie. Whatever's happening, just -- talk to me. Charlie takes this in, emotional. But-- \nCHARLIE I can't let you get hurt. You need to forget about me for a while. \nAMY What? How am I going to get hurt? Tell me. Charlie-- Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs- \nJANE I got it-- \nCHARLIE NO. Don't answer it. A tense moment. Another knock. \nINNERCUT WITH \nEXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- DUSK \nJERRY stands at the door. Quietly enraged. \n", "test3_id": 1607}

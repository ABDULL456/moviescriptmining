KANE I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do - 
EMILY Let him finish, Charles. 
ROGERS I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected.  If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher. Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral - (he stresses the world) Champeen of the people.  Just as long as - 
EMILY I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but wonder if - (she leaves her sentence unfinished) 
KANE You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't - 
SUSAN (excitedly) Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name - 
ROGERS That's the chance I'm willing to give you, Mr. Kane.  More of a chance than you'd give me.  Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you're so sick that you've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story I'm going to give them. 
Kane starts to stare at him intently. 
EMILY What story, Mr. Rogers? 
ROGERS The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane. 
Emily looks at Kane. 
SUSAN There is no story.  It's all lies. Mr. Kane is just - 
ROGERS (to Susan) Shut up! (to Kane) I've had a dozen men doing nothing but run this thing down - we've got evidence enough to - well, the evidence would stand up in any court of law.  You want me to give you the evidence, Mr. Kane? 
KANE You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided.  The election Tuesday'll be only - 
ROGERS Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you - 
EMILY You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you. 
ROGERS I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way - (he pauses) - and so would you, Mrs. Kane. 
SUSAN What about me? (to Kane) He said my name'd be dragged through the mud.  He said everywhere I'd go from now on - 
EMILY There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.  I'd say that it has been made for you. (pauses) I suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow, Mr. Rogers. About the statements by the doctors - 
KANE Have you gone completely mad, Emily? 
Emily looks at him. 
KANE You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you? 
EMILY I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has - 
KANE Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me - 
EMILY Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I? (quickly) And Junior? 
KANE (squirming a bit) I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state - 
EMILY I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing. 
SUSAN Charlie!  If they publish this story - 
EMILY They won't.  Goodnight, Mr. Rogers. (she starts out) There's nothing more to be said, Charles. 
KANE Oh yes, there is. 
EMILY I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles? 
KANE No. 
She looks at him.  He starts to work himself into a rage. 
KANE There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think - 
EMILY You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. (she looks at Susan) You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. (she sighs) Come on, Charles. 
KANE Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone! 
ROGERS You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you - 
KANE (turning on him) Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter. 
ROGERS I see! (he starts toward the door) 
SUSAN (starting to cry) Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize - 
KANE I know exactly what I'm doing. (he is screaming) Get out! 
EMILY (quietly) Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late - 
KANE Too late for what?  Too late for you and this - (he can't find the adjective) this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it! 
SUSAN Charlie, there are other things to think of. (a sly look comes into her eyes) Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers - 
EMILY It is too late now, Charles. 
KANE (rushes to the door and opens it) Get out, both of you! 
SUSAN (rushes to him) Charlie, please don't -

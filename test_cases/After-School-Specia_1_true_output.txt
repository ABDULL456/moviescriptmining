FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        52. 
MATT And ACTION! But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's starting to sweat. MATT (CONT'D) Action, Jake. JAKE Okay. Still nothing. DEACON Come on, Jake. We're filming. JAKE All right. Hang on a second. He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit. FRED My arm's getting tired. ASHLEY So's his. MATT Action... Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley. ASHLEY That's it? JAKE Hey, it's not hard yet. ASHLEY I can see that. Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye. DEACON Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him out. She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds later... ASHLEY Aaaahhhh!

MATT Wait! I'm not set up for that shot! FRED Can I put down the boom? DEACON Jake? What's happened? Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts. JAKE This has never happened before. She got me too excited. ASHLEY Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first? JAKE (copping an attitude) What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay? DEACON Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together. MATT We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage. JAKE I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first I'll kill you, and then I'll bust you guys. He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and leaves. ASHLEY Now what? The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How far are they willing to go? MATT Deacon. You do it. DEACON No way. MATT Come on. This is your big chance.

DEACON No. You do it. A beat. MATT Fred. FRED What? MATT Come on. FRED You. MATT I have to run the camera. FRED Oh, like you're the only one who can do that. MATT (false bravado) Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake of the film. Hold this. He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off. DEACON Matt. Stop it. MATT No, I'll do it. He desperately wants someone to hold him back. FRED (grabs him) Matt! They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this. FRED (CONT'D) Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment. MATT Fine with me. DEACON No. We can get someone else.

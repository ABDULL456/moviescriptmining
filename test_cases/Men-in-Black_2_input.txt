Kay starts walking after the Bug. 
KAY Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship. 
JAY Where are you going? 
KAY Getting my gun back. 
JAY What!? 
Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug. 
KAY (CONT'D) Hey, Bug! 
The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder. 
KAY (CONT'D) I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper? 
The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien hug. 
EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT 
She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the woods. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT 
Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face. 
KAY You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me! 
The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth. 
The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS his way down into its abdomen. 
JAY looks on, in stunned horror... 
AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Laurel is still watching. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT 
Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally defeated. But... 
He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach... 
CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach, we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY! 
INT. BUG - NIGHT 
Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug. 
JAY Hey! Come over here and try that! 
The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just keeps moving. 
Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug. 
JAY Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass! 
Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole. 
INT. BUG - NIGHT 
Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away. 
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT 
The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass. 
The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay -- 
-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the grass. 
Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him. 
He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when;

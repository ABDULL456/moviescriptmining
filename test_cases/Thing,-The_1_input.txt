It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass. 
The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point. 
Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles. 
Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food. 
CHILDS Where's the other one? 
Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle them with his flashlight. 
MACREADY (to dog) Where's your buddy, boy? Huh? 
No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his light. All three are growing uneasy. 
MACREADY Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't let up until he's ash. 
Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip. 
Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice. 
Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him. 
MacReady stumbles. 
The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear. 
He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It snarls; its face turns slowly toward him. 
Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly. 
MACREADY Childs!! 
Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible jump of some twenty feet. 
Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice in flames. 
MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and engulfs the screeching animal in fire. 
BENNINGS 
howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help. 
MACREADY (pulls him back) Stay back!! 
Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a different area and is just as quickly pulled back down. 
MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger. 
CHILDS What we going to do?! 
MACREADY How the fuck do I know?! 
Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls seem to be absorbing his head. 
MacReady runs for the snowmobile. 
MACREADY Torch them!! 
CHILDS But... 
MACREADY He's gone already! Do it! 
Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and whatever has him catch fire. A screeching. 
MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps cans of gasoline on the writhing mess. 
He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage. 
He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them. 
They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to subside. 
THE SUN 
Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COMPOUND - REC ROOM 
The men are interrogating Clark. He is frazzled and defensive. 
CLARK ...I'm telling you I don't remember leaving the kennel unlatched... 
Childs is holding the industrial torch directly in his face. 
CHILDS Bullshit! You left it open so they could get out! 
EXT. TRASH DUMP

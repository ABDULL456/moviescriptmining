GRAHAM Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care... (beat) Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... 
Molly interrupts: 
MOLLY (V.O.) Will, I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff... (beat) I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you. And you are doing the right thing. It's costing you, too. And I know that. And I'm here. I'LL be here whenever you come home. Or I'LL meet you anywhere.  Anytime. That's what I called to say... 
Graham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of Molly herself. 
GRAHAM Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .. 
MOLLY (V.O.) 
GRAHAM I love you... 
WIDE SHOT: GRAHAM 
slowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half- packed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE DR. CHILTON - DAY 
DR. CHILTON Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham? 
GRAHAM (O.S.) I'm not a doctor. (beat) I need to see Lecter in as much privacy as possible. TWO SHOT Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of Staff, but not gifted. 
DR. CHILTON Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside. 
GRAHAM I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him. 
DR. CHILTON As long as it's on soft paper. You may(Pause) find this curious. 
He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines. 
DR. CHILTON Here Lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. Here he's subdued by the attendant and Lecter's shoulder is dislocated. Do you notice the strange thing? (pause) His pulse never got over eighty- five. Even when he tore into her face. 
Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a. response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is a blank. 
DR. CHILTON The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him? 
GRAHAM No. 
DR. CHILTON When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him? 
DR. CHILTON 
looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility. Right now he's seeing some more. 
GRAHAM (stands) I want to see Lecktor now. 
DR. CHILTON Uh... sure... 
INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY 
We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters. An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now: 
GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL 
A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not stirred. Then: 
LECKTOR That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. 
GRAHAM I keep getting it for Christmas. 
CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD 
turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain. Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham is the patient. LECKTOR Did you get my card? 
GRAHAM I got it. Thank you. 
GRAHAM' S struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his emotional reactions. 
LECKTOR And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement. 
GRAHAM Stuart is fine. 
LECKTOR Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will? 
GRAHAM No. 
LECKTOR Of course, you don't. (pause) I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. 
GRAHAM Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry. 
LECKTOR And? 
GRAHAM Very interesting, even to a layman. 
Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his head. Then: 
LECKTOR A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it' 
GRAHAM You've read the transcript. It's all there. 
LECKTOR No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will?

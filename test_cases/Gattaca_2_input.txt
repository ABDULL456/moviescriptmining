EUGENE lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka.  In the background, the unmanned satellite dish.  JEROME relieves himself against the building at the base of the satellite. 
EUGENE (gently chiding Jerome over the joyride) You idiot.  You could ruin everything with a stunt like that. 
Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city. 
EUGENE (gazing up into the night sky) At least up there your piss will be worth something. (smiling at the thought) You'll all be showering in it, right? 
JEROME (zipping his fly) And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered. 
EUGENE (referring to the rocket ship) What is that one? 
Jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but merely glances to his watch.  He joins Eugene on the hood of the car. 
JEROME (looking at his watch) 11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew. 
EUGENE How long do you stay up there before you go? 
JEROME A day or so. 
EUGENE (beaming) I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life. 
Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome. 
JEROME You should be going instead of me. 
Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot. 
JEROME Up there they wouldn't be a problem. 
EUGENE (glancing heavenwards, shaking his head) You know I'm scared of heights. 
INT.  CRIME LABORATORY - AUTOPSY ROOM.  NIGHT. 
The body and clothing of the MISSION DIRECTOR, lying on a metal examining table is scanned with a blue-light magnifying instrument.  Fingernail specimens are taken for analysis.  In another area of the laboratory, the labelled vacuum bags are attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and automatically identified.  ID names and photographs of GATTACA EMPLOYEES begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed along with other personal details - all data automatically logged for later review. 
The photographs and personal details of JEROME and IRENE flash past, amongst the faces of other employees. 
We focus on a magnified close up of JEROME'S EYELASH, still clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag.  We continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the analyzer. 
INT.  CRIME LAB - ANALYZER MACHINE.  NIGHT. 
Inside the machine, a minute, cell-thin sliver is sliced from JEROME'S EYELASH and analyzed. 
INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S CRIME LAB.  NIGHT. 
A severed HUMAN TONGUE sits on a tray in a sterile, sealed chamber.  Using gloves that protrude through the chamber's glass wall, face buried in a binocular eyepiece, the INVESTIGATOR takes a swab from the tongue. 
INVESTIGATOR (to the tongue, as he inserts the tip of the swab into an analyzer) Let's see what you've got to say for yourself. 
A FEMALE ASSISTANT, looking on, hardly has time to smile at the remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer terminal.  The computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner of the tongue using genetic predictors.  The Investigator wanders over to the window as his Assistant reads the information from the screen. 
ASSISTANT The tongue is male.  Mature.  Blonse hair. Brown eyes.  Light complexion.  Between 5'11 and 6'1.  Pronounced Caucasian nose. Thin lips.  Weak chin.  Lobeless ears. Prematurely balding.  Slightly bow-legged. Broad shoulders.  Barrel chest... (pause) Blind. 
INVESTIGATOR (interest piqued) Blind? (mildly amused, checking the monitor for himself) The tongue is blind? 
ASSISTANT (confused) Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man? 
INVESTIGATOR (shrugs) Someone who is mindful that the blind still speak. 
The INVESTIGATOR is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer. On the screen, he discovers the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and the accompanying flashing message: TRACKING IN-VALID 883000181105-10  - NEW DATA - 
INT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - PARKING GARAGE.  NIGHT. 
Having plugged his car into an overnight charger, JEROME pushes EUGENE in his wheelchair to the elevator.  Bottle in hand, Eugene leans over and vomits on the ground.  Jerome shakes his head resignedly.  Eugene looks drunkenly up at Jerome. 
EUGENE (sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit) I'm sorry.  Did you want it?

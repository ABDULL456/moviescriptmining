There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree. At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha, 7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face, blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and beyond her the other children watching.

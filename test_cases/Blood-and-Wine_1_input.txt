176 CONTINUED: (3) 
JASON Let's finish what we started. Slowly, he kisses her. She lets her mouth respond: a sweet kiss, in spite of the circumstances. His fingers scissor her nipple. 
JASON Just don't tell me that you love me. He peels off his T-shirt. 
GABRIELLA (in a whisper) I love you. He gives her a hard look. She holds his gaze and pushes his jeans down until he finally kicks them off and they're both naked. They begin to make love. 
GABRIELLA Wait. Jason doesn't understand. She gently pushes him back. 
GABRIELLA This way. She turns on her stomach and guides him back into her. Jason moves now rapidly. 
GABRIELLA Slowly. Her hand on his ass guides the pace. She hasn't had a young man in a long time. 
GABRIELLA 
(IN SPANISH) What are you doing to me? 
(IN ENGLISH) Don't come, not yet. They move as one, their passion enveloping them. He makes her come first. Then, when her boay flattens, he also comes and he's lying on top of her, his face alongside hers, their breath gentling. Finally, they lie side.by side. 
GABRIELLA Will you get me a towel? With warm water. 
(CONTINUED) 
176 CONTINUED: (4) He kisses her and gets up. If she didn't love him before, she does now. 
177 INT. THE BATHROOM 
While he runs the water to'warm it, he looks at himself naked in the mirror. His face crumples. He no longer knows what he's doing. 
178 INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
He brings the towel back to Gabriella, who wipes herself. Her mood, too, has sobered. 
GABRIELLA (after a moment) Are you going to kill me, too? 
JASON 
(REPELLED) No! 
GABRIELLA You'll have to. I'll know. I'll be a witness. I'll know you planned it. 
JASON -- Would you do that? 
GABRIELLA 
(SOFTLY) I like-you too much to let you kill him. Jasonstarts to put on his clothes: 
GABRIELLA I need him, Jason. 
JASON 
(FURIOUS) You don't -- you don't! 
GABRIELLA I'm not going back to Caracas! You don't know how we live there. She pulls the pillow in front of her to hide her nakedness. He touches her shoulder; she shrugs him away. 
(CONTINUED) 
178 CONTINUED: 
GABRIELLA 
(GROWING FRANTIC) You have to leave now, Jason. 
JASON What are you talking about? This is my home. I'm home. She stares at him. His face is set. She can't persuade him. Jason thinks of his next step, a plan. 
GABRIELLA 
(COLDLY) This is not your room, though, is it. Jason starts toward the door. 
JASON You're never going to marry him, Gabriella. 
GABRIELLA Watch me. He closes the door with a solid CLICK. She starts to cry, and still crying, she pulls the sheets off the bed, she has to change the sheets. 
179 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Jason leans against the wall, his eyes squeezed shut, listening to her CRY. 
180 EXT. CONDO - DAY 
Alex carries his suitcase toward the condo.

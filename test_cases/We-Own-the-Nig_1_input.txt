SANDRA GRUSINSKY It's okay. 
Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to read his mind, speaks: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) He's alone. Your father just left for the precinct. 
Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "THANK YOU." The Guards step aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS: 
INT. WARD 
Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward. 
Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN. 
It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand. Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden: 
NURSE Sir...? 
Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking OUTPOURING of FEELING from him. 
He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead: 
NURSE (CONT'D) Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting hours are over. 
He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO: 
INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY 
A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE. 
Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught. He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino teens smoking CRACK. 
He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is clearly Rosario's mother.) 
INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER 
Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then, barely audible, his voice cracking: 
BOBBY GREEN ...Feels like it was my fault... 
He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach. She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head. 
She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering "no...no...". In this moment, he needs her. In this moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT 
Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine. Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show--as usual: 
LOUIS FALSETTI Where'd you run off to, like a Jew? You got outta there, it became like a real zoo. The spics-- (looks to Rosario) `Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and I'm keepin' everybody in line. I'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm fuckin' bustin' heads-- 
He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check. 
LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that. 
Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOBBY GREEN Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check. 
LOUIS FALSETTI Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what I did. 
Louis smiles, walks off.    Scoops up the tip from a nearby table. 
BOBBY GREEN Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago. 
ROSARIO DIAZ I ain't ever gonna say nothing! I just thought...maybe he could cheer you up a little. 
Bobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus. Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them: 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Hey, look who's here! 
ROSARIO DIAZ Hey Vadim... (as Vadim approaches) We were just gettin' something to eat. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI (nods; to Bobby:) You make it through that bust okay? 
Bobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident: 
BOBBY GREEN I didn't have nothing on me. 
VADIM NEZHINSKI Glad to hear it. 
Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then: 
BOBBY GREEN Your uncle's got some problems now, though. (CONTINUED)

HER P.O.V. - 
RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look. 
A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else, anger at her humiliation being observed. 
94    EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        94 
RICKI TARR'S P.O.V. 
As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.

Ricki watches the street below as Boris, Sergei and Ivan exit the hotel, head for a night out. 
Tarr pulls on his own jacket, grabs his knife.

IRINA'S P.O.V. - Her husband and the Minders are heading for a row of gaudy nightclubs. And someway behind him, Ricki Tarr, trailing. 
She exhales a breath on the glass.

Tarr approaches the night club, glancing around quickly before slipping inside. 
97    INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                           97 
Ricki Tarr enters. He scans the room for Boris, spotting Tufty Thesinger at a table. He crosses towards him, watching as Boris and the two minders are entertained by the clubs hostesses. 
Boris calls for more drinks, clutching a bundle of currency. 
TUFTY THESINGER (grinning) This is going to be a long night. 
RICKI TARR You baby-sit this one. 
Ricki walks towards us.

Irina answers the door and finds Ricki Tarr outside. 
RICKI TARR Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. (Beat) Just wanted to check you were alright. 
She stares at him. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was something about her.

Tarr exhales smoke. Smiley studies him. 
SMILEY You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? 
RICKI TARR Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her. 
SMILEY Sense what? 
RICKI TARR A secret.

Ricki Tarr is talking to a man. A sports car lies under a sheet. The deal concluded, the man pulls back the sheet to reveal the car.

A workers canteen on the Bosphorus. Tarr and Irina sit drinking wine, talking. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it... 
Tarr gently traces a bruise on Irina's arm. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) But second date she made this open play... 
We see a growing attraction between them. 
Irina and Tarr laughing, flirting. They move closer to one another.

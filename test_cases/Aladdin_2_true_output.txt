(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) 
JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly handsome you are. 
(The GENIE's jaw drops.) 
JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more about...myself. JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed... 
(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) 
GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy! ALADDIN:    Shh! GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.) Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath, now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.) ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's mouth.)  I'll improvise. 
(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) 
JAFAR:  Go on. JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.) 
IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.) JAFAR:  And the street rat? JASMINE:    What street rat? 
(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) 
ABU:        Yuck! JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her crown.) You!!  How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

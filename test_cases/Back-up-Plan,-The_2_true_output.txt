STAN Yeah. My family has a goat farm. We make cheese. You like cheese? 
ZOE I guess. I've never really thought about it. 
STAN Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us at the Farmer's market? Come by sometime and you can taste my cheese. (then) Okay, I'm going to go. This has not gone as planned. 
Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go. 
ZOE Bye. 
Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around. Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go. 
EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNING 
Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window. 
INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow. Zoe opens her eyes. 
After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out as far as it will go. It's flat as a board. 
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small, East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing. 
This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL, 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader. 
CAROL Everyone, please say hello to Zoe. 
EVERYONE Hi, Zoe. 
CAROL Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice. As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen. 
The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to Zoe. 
LORI Are you a doer or a tryer? 
ZOE Excuse me? 
LORI Are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one? 
ZOE Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just inseminated a few days ago. (then) Inseminated...makes me feel like a cow or something. 
CAROL Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right? (then) So, tell us a little bit about yourself. 
ZOE Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet store on Hudson Street. Dogs, cats, rabbits...no birds, they creep me out. Before that, I worked for Google, which I completely hated. One day, I decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, I quit Google, cashed out and bought the pet store. Now I'm really happy on the work front, but I still haven't found, you know, the one. 
CAROL Ah, yes.   The elusive "one." 
ZOE I always imagined I'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way. So, time for Plan B. 
CAROL Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. But guess what...you have to create your own happiness. You don't need someone to complete you, some...man. You already are complete. 
LORI Amen, sister. 
CAROL If you want to have a baby, we here at Single Mothers By Choice can be your partners. We will be your emotional rocks. 
Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl covered in tatoos. And several more... 
CAROL (CONT'D) From inception to college graduation and everything in between. We're here for each other. 
Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child. 
SARA Dakota was actually born right here in this very room. Right where you're sitting, actually. 
ZOE (uncomfortable) Really? Right here?      Imagine that. 
SARA Best day of my life. 
ZOE And how old is she now? 
Dakota looks up from the breast. 
DAKOTA I'm three. 
INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY 
Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of pastries and a pot of coffee. 
MONA Why did you join a support group of unattractive, militant lesbians when you have me? 
ZOE Because you're really not that supportive.

HARDY (CONT'D) knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns? He Dunbar nods. HARDY I was also his " knife dummy" . (to Osborne) See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day. Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar. HARDY Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I'd ask where West and the others are. Can we get to them? He looks to the floor. DUNBAR There's no need... HARDY They're dead, aren't they? Dunbar looks back up at Hardy. DUNBAR Yeah. INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING Styles lowers his head at this. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING HARDY You kill them? No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward. OSBORNE The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer- HARDY See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". (MORE) 
HARDY She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established. Osborne, stunned by this. HARDY But I don't want to play games. That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors - everyone knows those things are two way, right? Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly. HARDY Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay? DUNBAR Okay. Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves. INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits. OSBORNE Baseball? HARDY Believe somebody owes me ten dollars- OSBORNE You made me look like an idiot- HARDY Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop - by admitting it I appeared trustworthy. STYLES You think he did it? OSBORNE No- HARDY Yes- They stop, looking at each other. 
STYLES You've got four hours and forty-five minutes to find out. 
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING 
Hardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him. 
HARDY Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray? 
DUNBAR I'm not telling you what happened. 
HARDY Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like - nice guys? Dunbar takes a deep breath.

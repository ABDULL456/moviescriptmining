GEORGES Anne? 
Geoff nods. Georges shrugs. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) It's hard to say. Sometimes I get the feeling she's totally unaware of the state she's in. And then I feel the opposite. It's... I don't know. 
GEOFF And what about the doctor? What does he say? 
GEORGES He's... 
Eva comes in through the door. She's in floods of tears. 
EVA (CRYING) She only talks gibberish. I don't know what... 
Geoff gets up, hesitantly. 
GEOFF Hey, dear... 
He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was sitting. 
GEOFF (CONT'D) ...come here, sit down, it's OK. 
She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down. 
EVA Nothing is OK. 
At first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to sit down on the sofa. Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges: 
EVA (CONT'D) What's going on, actually? You can't just leave her lying on her bed like that! She's unrecognizable! It's ridiculous! 
GEORGES We can't do anything for the moment. Calm down, darling. She's getting medical treatment, they give her the necessary medication, and there are no other options right now. 
EVA What does that mean, "no other options"? Why isn't she in a hospital? 
GEORGES She had a second stroke. Bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures. (MORE) 
GEORGES (CONT'D) Anyway, they wouldn't keep her, they'd send her to a care home. What they do in those places, we can do here. 
Eva looks at him, amazed. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) And she won't be put in a care home. I promised her that. 
GEOFF Don't you think you're taking on too much? 
GEORGES Have you got a better idea?

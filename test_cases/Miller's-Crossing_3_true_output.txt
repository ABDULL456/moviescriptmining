Tom Mm. . . 
Terry starts to turn away. 
. . . Tell Leo he's not God on the throne, he's just a cheap mick political boss with no brains and an office that looks like a French whore- house. 
Tom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his shoulder. 
Terry One more thing. . . 
He cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook, knocking him back into the booth again. 
Tom rubs his chin, looking up at Terry. 
Tom Leo say that too. . . ? 
As Terry and the gunmen get into the car: 
Terry No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next time I'll say plenty. 
We FADE OUT as the door slams and the car roars off. 
Over black we hear: 
Caspar When you're right you're right, but you never say I told you so. 
43.  FADE IN 
On Tom, sitting into frame in Caspar's office. 
Tom So what'm I right about? 
Behind his desk, Caspar is smiling. 
Caspar Well, I'll tell ya, but first you gotta promise not to say I told you so. 
Tom's eyes hold an Caspar's.  He is taking out a pack of cigarettes. 
Tom I never say that.  And I don't like people who do. 
Caspar Mink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah. 
Tom . . . What convinced you of that? 
Caspar Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't find him. Bluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal- ly, I think you were right.  I think Mink and Bernie was in it together.  I think Mink heard you'd bumped the Motzah, and lit out.  The lousy sonofabitch. 
His eyes on Caspar, Tom takes out a cigarette, lights it, takes a deep drag. 
Tom . . . I told you so. 
Caspar laughs. 
Caspar Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all right.  I don't generally care for it, but that's all right. . . You were a good sport to bump the Motzah.  I just like to make sure my friends is my friends.  So. 
He throws his hands up. 
. . . Friends, right? 
Tom How d'you know Mink skipped? 
Caspar Bluepoint can't find him. 
Tom So he says. 
Caspar stares at Tom. 
Caspar Meanin' what, exactly? 
Tom Maybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought until now, since a guy will say pretty much anything when he knows his number is up, but just before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up.  That they were the ones that were selling out your fix. 
Caspar looks at Tom. 
Caspar 'Zat so. . . 
He thinks for a beat. 
. . . Like you say, a guy'll say anything. 
Tom . . . Uh-huh.  So why isn't Bluepoint here? 
Caspar Well. . . 
He figdets. 
. . . He don't care for you, kid.  Maybe it's only fair to tell you. . .  After you left us, he tried to sell me on a double-cross.  He says to me, why don't we double-cross you and give you the bump once we get the Motzah.  But I figure a deals a deal, you're square with me, you bump the Motzah, I'll hold up my end.  Question of ethics. Everything above board, that's how I like it, so everybody knows who's a friend and who's an enemy. . .  But Bluepoint wouldn't cross me.  We go back. 
Tom Uh-huh. . . Course, there's always that wild card when love is involved. . . 
Caspar is staring intently at Tom.  After a beat: 
Caspar . . . I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still don't make it that way. 
Tom Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to worry about. 
Caspar seems lost in thought: 
Caspar Yeah. . . 
We hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny Jr. runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper. 
Johnny Jr. Poppa!  Poppa!  I got a prize from the-- 
Caspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster, still looking at Tom. 
Caspar Just a minute. 
As Tom rises to his feet: 
. . . Course, there's no reason not to be careful-- 
Johnny Jr. Poppa!  Poppa!  The sisters gave me a--unnnh! 
Cascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head. He points at Tom. 
Caspar Shaddap!  You take a page outta this guy's book. A little less you talk and a little more you think!

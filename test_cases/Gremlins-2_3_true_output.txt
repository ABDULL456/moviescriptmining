His hair is on end, his eyebrows charred, and he's knocking over furniture. He's alive -- he just doesn't know what planet he's on. 
CUT TO: 142 EXT. CLAMP PLAZA BUILDING 1s2 Two FIRE ENGINES have pulled up outside the building. As FIREMEN connect their hoses to hydrants, COPS push the CROWD back to clear a path to the door for the firemen.

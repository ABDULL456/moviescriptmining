MURIEL (beginning to be a little angry) Because I wasn't in love with him! 
JIM (vindictively) That's not what you said in your diary! 
MURIEL (now really angry) Oh, now you've been reading my diary! 
JIM (a little guilty) Well -- it happened to fall open and... I... happened to look at it. It... just happened. 
MURIEL I'll just bet! 
JIM It's all over the book so why don't you admit it? You were in love with Bill Cole! 
MURIEL Don't be absurd! Of course I was in love with Bill. In those days I was in love with a new man every week. 
JIM Then why did you marry me? 
MURIEL I'm beginning to wonder! (exploding) Maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin! Maybe I knew that some day you'd bring me out to this thirty- eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried-up trout stream and no windows! Or maybe I just happened to fall in love with you -- but for heaven's sake, don't ask me why! 
Muriel stalks out of the bathroom. Jim looks after her, thoughtfully starts to dry his face. 
INT. THE BEDROOM 
Jim enters. Muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding the clock. Jim noisily clears his throat. No reaction. 
JIM (tentatively) ...Muriel? 
No reaction. 
JIM ...Honey? 
No reaction. 
JIM Would it do any good to say I'm sorry? 
MURIEL I don't know. 
Jim gently turns her around facing him. 
JIM Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy and I'm sorry. 
Muriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles. 
MURIEL Oh, Jim! 
She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately. As their lips part: 
MURIEL (dreamily) Why don't you take the soap out of your ears? 
JIM (same) Why do I love you so much? 
Jim again kisses her tenderly, warmly. 
MURIEL (breathless) Darling, it's awfully late. 
Jim kisses her again, a little more ardently. 
MURIEL (same) Maybe you ought to go down and lock the doors. 
JIM (kissing her ear) What for? The windows are all open anyway. 
MURIEL (as he starts to kiss her again) Jim, you have to get up at six o'clock. 
JIM (considers; logic prevails; brief sigh) Yes, I guess so. 
MURIEL (reluctantly) Goodnight, dear. 
JIM (same) Goodnight. 
Each gets into his own bed, still wearing the overcoats. 
DISSOLVE 
INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - The house now wavers at $37,000. As Jim and Muriel still try to stem the tide, the group that is pushing the house ever upward includes all of the previous people connected with the house and -- in addition --plumbers, painters, landscape gardeners, etc. Over this, and across the scene flutter more bills, more extras. 
BILL'S VOICE And so the days sped by -- and the bills -- and the extras -- and as the house approached forty thousand dollars, Jim approached his deadline for the new slogan. It was almost a photo finish.

EXT. RADIO CITY - NIGHT (STOCK) 
It is raining. The lights are on in the buildings. 
INT. JIM'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Mary is attending to some detail work as the door opens and Jim enters, disturbed. Mary looks at him questioningly. 
JIM You'd better send out for coffee and sandwiches,... It looks like an all night session.

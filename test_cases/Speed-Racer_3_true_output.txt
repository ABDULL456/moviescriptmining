MOM Because I am so impossibly proud to be your mother. And even though your father doesn't say it, he is too. She puts her arms around him. 
MOM (CONT'D) Don't worry. We'll figure this out. We just have to stick together. Something good will happen. You'll see. Ding dong. The front doorbell chimes. 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Sprittle opens the door revealing Inspector Detector of the Corporate Investigation Bureau who looks older and harder than when we saw him in the flashbacks Behind him is Racer X. Sprittle sees the masked racer and screams. Chim-Chim screams. They look at each other screaming and then slam the door. They begin running around, flailing like Chicken Little, waving their arms in panic. 
SPRITTLE 
RACER HEX! THE HARBINGER OF BOOM! 
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! Popsstorms into the room. 
POPS What are you two squawking about? They dive behind the couch but peek out as Pops heads for the door. 
SPRITTLE Pops, whatever you do, don't open the door! 
EXT. RACER HOUSE 
Racer X doesn't like it. 
RACER X This is a bad idea. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR If it was any other driver, you'd be here. Popsopens the door and Racer X sets his jaw. 
POPS Inspector Detector? 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR Good morning, Mr.. Racer. I know it's been a long time-- 
CONTINUED: He extends his hand and Pop shakes it. 
POPS Ten years. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR Yes. I'm sorry for this intrusion, but I was hoping to have a word with you and Speed. Pops eyes the masked racer. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR (CONT'D) It's important. 
INT. RACER LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Mom serves coffee and cookies. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR We've been after Remmington for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing but we haven't had the evidence we need to convict him. Until now. Sprittle and Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as Mom offers the masked racer a cup of coffee. 
MOM Here you are, Mr. X. Sprittle points at Racer X. 
SPRITTLE What's he doing here? 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR Racer X works closely with our WRL corporate crimes division, helping us recruit drivers like you, Speed. Most of the media, which you are now seeing is controlled by the Major Sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to the sport. The truth is he's our most valuable weapon against these villains. 
SPEEED Why does he always wear that mask? 
CONTINUED: 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR If any of, you actually knew his identity, you would become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious Fixers in the world. Gulp. They both sink back down behind the couch. 
SPEED What do you want with me? 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR You're familiar with the driver Katsu Okamoto? 
SPEED Of course. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR For years he has been contracted by a Fixer named Cruncher Block who we know works for Remmington. Recently, Katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop in the stock price of Okamoto Engineering. We believe this is a part of a corporate strategy to allow Mushi motors to buy control of Okamoto. Katsu doesn't want this to happen and he began resisting, thinking.that he could do it on his own. After Fuji, he realized he needed help. 
POPS ,Why help him? 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR Because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Remmington which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives. The problem is, he won't give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his family's company. 
SPEED How? 
CONTINUED: (2) 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR There is an up-coming race that Katsu believes if he can win, it will catapult Okamoto Engineering back into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out which should kill it. 
SPEED But there aren't any more races left except for the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify. Inspector takes a big breath. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR There aren't any track races. This is a cross-country rally. 
SPARKY You mean The Crucible? 
POPS What?! 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR I know it seems cruel of me to ask, but Katsu made it clear that he had to have Speed an X on his team or there would be no deal. 
POPS Absolutely out of the question. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B-- 
POPS No! Rally racing is a back alley sport full of jackals, head- hunters and thugs! I'm sorry, Inspector but I lost one son to that death-trap. I won't lose another. 
INSPECTOR DETECTOR I understand. If you change your

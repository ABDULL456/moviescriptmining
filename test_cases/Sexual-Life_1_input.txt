EXT. CITY SKYLINE - DAY 
From an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city.  Any city will do.  Mirrored high rises.  Sprawling apartment complexes.  A lot of people live here...whoever they are. 
As we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at all, but a scale model of one. 
Everything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways. GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside. 
VARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life 
A man dines alone.  A woman walks her dog.  Two kiss on the street. One waits for a bus. 
Over this we HEAR Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the standard "When We're Alone" 
Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney For stars to go by, A sweet slice of heaven For just you and I, When we're alone. 
From all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're alone. 
As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature bed.

INT. LORNA'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY 
A cramped one-room studio.  Asleep on a futon is a slender girl of nineteen -- LORNA.  Her blood red toenails give the place its only color. An alarm clock rings it's twelve noon.  Lorna uses her foot to turn it off. 
LORNA Terri.  Why did you let me sleep so late? 
Lorna looks over to an empty pull-out sofa, its only occupant a skinny kitten. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
Terri? 
(to the cat) 
She must already be at work, huh? 
The cat meows -- very non-committal. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LORNA'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Still in her T-shirt and panties, Lorna opens a can of cat food as the kitten looks on. 
LORNA She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur?  Some friend she turned out to be.  Not like you.  You remember what day it is, don't you? 
(off the cat's blank stare) 
I'm not giving you any food until you tell me. 
Arthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow.  Lorna smiles and sets down the food. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
That's right.  I knew you'd remember. 
CUT TO OMITTED 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Lorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop.  Reading the crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips, spilling her purse. 
Embarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to a Latino Woman.  Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle. 
Stumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman. 
LORNA Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts? 
The Woman shrugs and looks off. 
Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings.  She reaches into her purse but it's not there.  Then, she spots it...in the street.  But the moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it to smithereens. 
LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) 
Oh my god.

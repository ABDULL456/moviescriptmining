The phones are quiet. Alone, Harris stares at the portion of the wall that he assembled. Collero enters. 
DETECTIVE QUINN Too bad you didn't find more of it. 
SGT. HARRIS Yeah. And wish I could figure out where this is. 
He points to a small torn photo, taped back together. 
SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D) I checked websites for every tourist destination I could -- 
DETECTIVE COLLERO That's the presidential palace. (Harris turns & stares) It was all over CNN. When they deposed...what's-his-name. 
330    INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- NIGHT                 330

AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.) We'll now begin boarding by rows. 
331A   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - SECURITY OFFICE -- NIGHT                 331A 
An AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF snatches photos of Lara and John out of the printer and bolts out of the office, joined by two other OFFICERS.

333    INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                       333 
Nabulsi waits in silence on the other end of a phone.     The room is full, no one speaks. 
334    INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT                              334 
A second AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER squeezes along the wall, passing the waiting passengers. We pan to see Luke's brightly colored roller-board. Our hearts stop; it is all over. 
335    INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT                       335 
Nabulsi waits on the other line for an eternity.    Finally: 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.) Sorry. There is no one by their description on the flight. 
LT. NABULSI They're on it. Do you have the photographs? 
335A   INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT                              335A 
The young AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANT kneels to help the child with the colorful rollerboard -- we see it's a FIVE YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
AIR CANADA ATTENDANT Can I take this for you? 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.) We have the photographs. They aren't on this plane.

AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (listens, turns to attendant #2) Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight? 
337   INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                    337 
AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF     (O.S.) No other flights. Anything else? 
LT. NABULSI ....No.   Thank you. 
Nabulsi hangs up, defeated.     Quinn stares out the window, deep in thought. 
DETECTIVE QUINN It's starting to rain. 
Nabulsi looks at him as if he's nuts. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO I'll call the FBI. 
Collero exits, Quinn turns and looks at the partial "wall." 
DETECTIVE QUINN You ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others? 
338   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                                338

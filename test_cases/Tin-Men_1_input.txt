146   CONTINUED:                                              146 TILLEY You gave them evidence? BB The only way I could think to get out of this business. He smiles. TILLEY (points, laughing) Hey, that's good... that's good, yeah. There's activity in the hallway. 
VOICE (O.S.) The hearing for the Home Improvement Commission is now in session. Tilley stands. TILLEY (to BB) So... how's Nora? BB She's doin' all right. A MAN comes out of the hearing room. MAN Ernest Tilley? TILLEY Yeah... here. (turns to BB) Take good care of her. CUT TO: 
147   INT. TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - LONG SHOT OF HEARING ROOM - DAY 147 of the Home Improvement Commission. Five  or six commissioners are behind a long table, led by John Masters, there is a gallery of observers, and Tilley sits at the defense table across from the commissioners. MASTERS (into microphone) Are you aware that that's a violation of sections 258 and (CONTINUED) 
147   CONTINUED:                                                  147 TILLEY I'm not aware of the section numbers. Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch, that's all. BB is watching the proceedings.      CAMERA HOLDS ON him. MASTERS (O.S.) Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'? 
ON TILLEY who is falling apart. TILLEY As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers. MASTERS It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle. (beat) The point that we'd like to stress, is that you misled these people. Told them the job was free. Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars. That is misleading and deceptive sales practice. TILLEY It was    temporary insanity. I don't    know... it just came over me ... it    might have been something I ate.     I don't know... it was crazy,    I'm the first to admit it was a    crazy thing to do. Believe me... (CONTINUED) 
147   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            147 MASTERS (cutting him off) We have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on December 11, 1962. You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place. TILLEY What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations. 
ON BB who is watching the proceedings intently. MASTERS (O.S.) It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state. 
CAMERA ON MASTERS MASTERS It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding... 
CAMERA ON TILLEY He's not very happy. MASTERS (O.S.) ... Which will prohibit you from practicing in the state of Maryland. TILLEY Are you sure? Maybe the guys want to think this over. (CONTINUED) 
147   CONTINUED:   (3)                                           147 BACK TO MASTERS MASTERS Thank you, Mr. Tilley. You may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out. 
TILLEY gets up from the table and goes to the back of the room to exit the building. He stops at a desk just inside the door where the clerk is sitting. Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out a small document, and throws it down on the desk. He exits the building. CUT TO:

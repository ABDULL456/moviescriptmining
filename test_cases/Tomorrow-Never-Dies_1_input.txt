INT. CAFE - 
DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action. 
RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE - 
Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder: 
VALENTIN'S VOICE Mr. James Bond! 
Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons. 
BOND Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise. 
VALENTIN What is it that brings you to Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business - (sly glance to the thugs) Or somebody else's business? 
The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck. 
A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos. 
SOFIA Dimitri!!! You promised I could go shopping!! 
VALENTIN (sotto, to Bond) New mistress. (to her, impatiently) So? Go! 
SOFIA I need money. 
Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH. 
VALENTIN Here. Take an inch. 
Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond: 
VALENTIN Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's free. 
With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move several steps to the bar. 
VALENTIN (to the bartender) Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred. (to Bond) And you? 
Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion. 
BOND One. 
As the bartender pours: 
BOND I must say, Valentin, capitalism seems to be treating you well. 
VALENTIN (belting one back) I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes. (then) Off the record. 
BOND Of course. If you can't beat the government, you might as well own it. 
Valentin spots someone off-camera. 
VALENTIN Wait - I want you to meet a friend of mine. (calling out) Elliot! Elliot! Come here. 
Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever. 
VALENTIN Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce you to an old friend - 
BOND (putting out a hand to shake) The name is Bond. James Bond. 
Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous: 
HARMSWAY Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... (a nod to Valentin) Especially one with such distinguished friends. 
BOND You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers. 
VALENTIN (chortling) 'Biggest followers?' He's practically made a career' of it!! 
He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain. 
BOND It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. 
HARMSWAY (smiles) I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. (signaling off camera) Darling! Come here. (beat) I want you to meet my wife. 
A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond - 
HARMSWAY Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce you to James Bond. 
There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming his most insinuating smile: 
HARMSWAY But then... I believe you two have already met. 
There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then - 
POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT! 
The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI- TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS. 
DiGIACOMO Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices of the Italian government, I, Franco DiGiacomo - (pauses; smiles at a camera; POP! A flash goes off) Am arresting you for the illegal possession of weapons grade enriched uranium. (to his underlings) Seize the boat! 
A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway. 
VALENTIN I think I suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in Moscow. 
To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws. 
HARMSWAY My friends, there's been a terrible mistake. (putting his arm around DiGiacomo) Come. Let me show you. 
And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her: 
BOND Paris - 
PARIS Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!! 
BOND Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? 
PARIS (anguished) He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. (beat) You've got to protect me! 
Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key: 
BOND Go to my hotel room. I'll be there in twenty minutes. 
Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she wants to hear him say 'I love you.' 
PARIS Just - say it. Say it just once. 
BOND (pauses, discomfited) One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go. 
She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him. 
INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - 
Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in. 
HARMSWAY I believe this is what you're looking for, Colonel. 
He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister. 
HARMSWAY Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch - (runs the Geiger counter over it) It's depleted uranium! Completely safe! A child could sleep on it. 
Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.

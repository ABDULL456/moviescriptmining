FIRST UNION GUY You think they know what they're doing on the fifth floor? 
SECOND UNION GUY I got eight kids to support--they better. 
They start for the sports section, only this time, they stop, go back, stare at the headline again. From them watching--

walking WOODWARD to the elevators. 
WOODWARD What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for? 
SIMONS Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? (WOODWARD pushes for the elevator) And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you. 
WOODWARD You think she wants us to ease up on the story? 
SIMONS (shrugs) I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you? 
The elevator opens. WOODWARD shakes his head "no" and steps inside as we 
CUT TO: 
MRS. GRAHAM in her office as a SECRETARY lets WOODWARD in. He's nervous. She's standing by the window, he crosses to her. 
MRS. GRAHAM I'm so glad you could come, Mr.-- 
WOODWARD --I'm Woodward. 
She nods. There's a pause. He waits. She's trying to say something, get something started, but it's difficult. Silence. She stares out again, quietly starts to talk. 
MRS. GRAHAM You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?" (She looks at WOODWARD) I woke up again last night with that same question. (WOODWARD says nothing, waits) Are we right on this story? 
WOODWARD I think so. 
MRS. GRAHAM Are you sure? 
WOODWARD No. 
MRS. GRAHAM When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all? 
WOODWARD It may never come out. 
MRS. GRAHAM Never? Please don't tell me never. (beat) Ben says you've found some wonderful sources. 
WOODWARD Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am. 
MRS. GRAHAM And the underground garage one. (WOODWARD, more nervous now, nods) Would I know him? 
WOODWARD I couldn't say. 
MRS. GRAHAM But it's possible. 
WOODWARD (throat very dry) It is. 
MRS. GRAHAM You've never told anyone who he is? (WOODWARD shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if I asked you. (WOODWARD nods) Tell me. 
WOODWARD (he is dying) I would, if you really ever wanted to know. 
MRS. GRAHAM I really want to know. 
CUT TO: 
WOODWARD caught between a rock and a hard place. He is silent until there is the SOUND of light laughter and we-- 
CUT TO: 
MRS. GRAHAM. The laughter came from her. 
MRS. GRAHAM I wasn't serious. I have plenty of burdens to carry around, I don't need another. 
WOODWARD tries not to exhale too audibly. 
MRS. GRAHAM We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we? 
WOODWARD Nobody ever had too much. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP--MRS. GRAHAM as abruptly she reaches out, touches WOODWARD on the arm. 
MRS. GRAHAM Do better. 
WOODWARD makes a nod. HOLD. Then--

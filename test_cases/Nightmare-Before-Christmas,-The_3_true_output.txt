Jack's Obsession Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast 
CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack Don't know if we're ever going to get him back 
He's all alone up there Locked away inside Never says a word Hope he hasn't died Something's up with Jack Something's up with Jack 
JACK Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be? I cannot tell There's so many things I cannot grasp When I think I've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip 
Something here I'm not quite getting Though I try, I keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant, gone in a flash What does it mean? What does it mean? 
In these little bric-a-brac A secret's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all, I love it though

KATE (to Charlie; slightly annoyed) Drink if you want to, Charlie. (to Rochelle) Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself. (beat) And...I started going to 12-step meetings. 
Rochelle looks slightly disgusted. 
ROCHELLE Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. (to Charlie) Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... (Rochelle gestures to her living room) ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids. (beat) Bastard. (long beat; to Charlie) You better be careful -- they change. 
Kate and Charlie exchange a glance. 
KATE I thought you'd be happy for me, mom. 
ROCHELLE Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I? 
Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs it. 
ROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'll microwave you your favorite. 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while eating... 
...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.                                      * 
Rochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder. 
ROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch. 
KATE It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it. 
51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51 
Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village -- 
-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film. 
Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around. 
KATE This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned. 
Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the place. 
KATE (CONT'D) We came here every year the week before Christmas. (MORE) 
KATE (CONT'D) And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there. 
Kate points at the remains of a PEN. 
KATE (CONT'D) My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point. 
Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place. 
KATE (CONT'D) This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. (long beat) Thanks for coming up here with me. 
CHARLIE Of course. 
KATE I'm sorry my mom's so awful. 
CHARLIE (shrugs) She just can't handle her liquor. 
Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a moment. And then Charlie asks -- 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here? 
KATE Huh? 
CHARLIE You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something? 
KATE Um...no. 
CHARLIE I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house. 
Charlie puts his arms around Kate. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you. 
Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet.

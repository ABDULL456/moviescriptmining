ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) ball with a recklessness we've never seen in his playing. It's beginning to look as if he doesn't care whether he wins or loses because he's in a hurry - an awfully big hurry ---

EXT. METCALF STATION 
We see Bruno alight from the train.    He makes his way in the direction of the town. 
MED. SHOT METCALF STATION 
As Bruno comes toward us, he stands on   the sidewalk and then takes the lighter from his pocket once   more. At this moment a hurrying passenger on his way to the   depot accidentally jogs Bruno's elbow. The lighter flies    from his hand. 
CLOSE SHOT 
We see it fall through the bars of a grating by the sidewalk.

BRUNO Down there -- my -- my cigarette -- (catches himself -- not wanting to say "cigarette lighter") case. It's very valuable. 
PORTER (peering down) Down here? 
BRUNO You've got to get this grating up right away. Two passersby enter. 
FIRST PASSERBY What's the trouble? 
BRUNO (yelling) Can't we do something...! (to passerby) I dropped my cigarette case. 
PORTER (looking down) Mightn't be any good, mister. Probably gone down the storm drain. 
BRUNO (horrified) Storm drain? 
FIRST PASSERBY On the other hand, it might have lodged on the edge. 
SECOND PASSERBY Don't they have a trap down there -- like under a sink? 
BRUNO (excited) Don't just stand here -- do something! 
PORTER (calmly) Guess we could phone the city engineer, all right. (MORE)

PORTER (CONT'D) Worst he could do would be to tell me to take a running jump and -- (Bruno grabs his arm. Porter shakes Bruno off) Relax, mister. 
BRUNO I don't want to relax. 
He goes on his knees and forces his arm down the drain.

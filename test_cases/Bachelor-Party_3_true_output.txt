Rick instinctively makes a move toward her. He decides to go for it. 
RICK'S POV - TRACEY 
Just then a strange thing happens to Tracey's face. It transforms into Debbies. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rick stops dead in his tracks. He can't believe it. Debbie's face is now on Tracey's body. 
TRACEY/DEBBIE You promised me, Rick. You promised you wouldn't make love to anyone else. 
Rick is shaken by this. He shakes his head and wipes at his eyes. Debbie's face is gone. He moves toward Tracey again. 
TRACEY 
Her face transforms into Sister Mary Francis. 
TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be true; be strong. 
Sister Mary Francis's face disappears. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
RICK I can't do it. 
TRACEY 
Her face becomes Stan's. 
TRACEY/STAN You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful! 
Stan's face turns back to Tracey's. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
All the kids from his bus are gathered around Tracey. They're egging him on. 
KIDS Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for it! 
Debbie's face appears on Tracey's. 
TRACEY/DEBBIE (pleading) Don't Rick. 
Debbie's face disappears. Rick can't take it anymore. 
RICK I can't do it. I love Debbie. 
He runs out of the room, leaving a very confused Tracey in his wake. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
O'Neill is waiting outside the bedroom door as Rick comes out. 
O'NEILL How'd it go? 
RICK Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister. 
O'NEILL I'm proud of you, lad. 
Rick crosses to the bar area as O'Neill watches him go, beaming. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT 
Cole enters the room. He runs to the window. 
COLE'S POV 
His window is right opposite the window in the hotel of Rick's party. 
COLE 
He's pleased. Very pleased. He places an arrow into his crossbow. 
COLE'S POV 
He's looking down his sights. Rick is the target... and an easy one at that, for at this very moment Rick is crossing past the window. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
The door opens and in walks Rajah, the Indian pimp. He looks pissed. He's looking for Gary. 
RAJAH (angry) Am looking for this dunghead who took my women... He is being liar to me. 45 minutes way over. 
COLE'S POV

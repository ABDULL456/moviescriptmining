OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other. 
213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY 
C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING. 
C-3PO: I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight. 
C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff. 
214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY 
From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall. 
SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower. 
OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower. 
ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below. 
OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master. 
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform. 
OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think. 
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river. 
ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . . 
OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil. 
ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil. 
OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost! 
ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise. 
ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin. 
OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground. 
ANAKIN: You underestimate my power! 
OBI-WAN: Don't try it. 
ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava. 
ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness. 
OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back. 
ANAKIN: I hate you! 
OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you. 
ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING. 
215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY 
OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames. 
He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit. 
216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY 
OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF. 
C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place. 
OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff. 
217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY 
PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her. 
PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right? 
OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her. OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives. 
218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY 
ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands. 
219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY 
An Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS. 
220 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY 
DARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit. 
221 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY 
DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.

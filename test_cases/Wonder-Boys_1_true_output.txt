124	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at the Gaskell house. 
125	EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER 
GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window. Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting onto its roof, melting. 
126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S 
GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he pulls away, but not before leaving... 
...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the frost of the glass. 
127	EXT. STREET  127 
The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, then looks up into the sky. 
GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 
...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters the silence. 
NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his hand. 
GRADY (as if addressing God) Is that a suggestion? 
GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 
GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- not without humor. Then she rolls down the window. 
GRADY I'm so glad to see you, Sara. 
SARA I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady? 
GRADY I'm through improvising. 
SARA Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? Did you lose it all? 
GRADY I lost it ail. 
SARA Oh, Grady. You're such a putz. 
GRADY I know. 
SARA And you're old. 
Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her fingers. Yanks. 
GRADY Ouch. How many? 
SARA Dozens. It's very sad. 
Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his, and-she glances away. 
GRADY I went and looked at-some babies just now. 
SARA Oh? 
GRADY (trying to make her laugh) I guess you have to go on faith. 
SARA (she doesn't) Some times... 
GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist. 
GRADY Did you tell Walter? 
SARA I told Walter. 
GRADY Does he still love you? 
SARA It didn't come up. 
GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious profile, then turns her chin gently toward him. 
GRADY Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're who I need. Because nothing makes sense without you. Because the best moment of every day is the moment I first see your face. And because when you leave a room, there's no reason to be in it any more. It's just a room again. 
Sara cocks her head. 
SARA Did you just make that up? 
GRADY (shaking his head) In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers. 
She frowns good-naturedly. 
GRADY (cont'd) Even so...it's still true. Every word. 
Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable. 
GRADY (cont'd) Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might tell you... 
Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING 
as Big Nurse, still on the phone, sees Miller go sprawling across the floor. She grabs the intercom. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Washington! Warren! To the day room, immediately! 
INT. DAY ROOM - MORNING 
McMurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps Candy and Rose out as Washington and Warren converge on them. McMurphy and Bromden wheel around. 
Washington, Warren and Miller appear around the corner, take one look, and head straight for McMurphy. 
WASHINGTON (stopping just short) 'Kay, let's have the keys an' nobody get hurt! 
Washington's words are cut off as, O.S., Nurse Pilbow SCREAMS... a bloodcurdling scream. They turn to see Nurse Pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with blood, hysterically talking to Big Nurse (we can't hear her). 
Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. 
McMurphy is glued to the spot. 
CANDY (calling from outside) Come on, come on, let's go! 
McMurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the hallway. 
INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - MORNING 
CAMERA SHOOTING TOWARD the door, crammed full of patients, who stare at the scene with curious detached looks, as Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow force their way through the patients. The crowd parts and Big Nurse stops in the doorway, horrified at what she sees. CAMERA HOLDS on Big Nurse's reaction. A beat, then McMurphy appears alongside Big Nurse and is stricken by what he sees. 
McMURPHY AND BIG NURSE'S POV - REVERSE SHOT - DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE 
The office is splattered with blood. Billy is lying face up, hanging over Spivey's desk, dead. His throat and both wrists are cut. A broken picture frame, containing a photograph of Spivey's family, lies nearby. 
MCMURPHY Billy, oh, Billy boy... 
McMurphy crosses into the room and kneels alongside Billy's body. He gently lays his hand on Billy's face. 
BIG NURSE Get away from him! Don't you dare touch him! 
McMurphy turns and leaps at Big Nurse, grabbing her throat; he drives her into the Acutes and Nurse Pilbow. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
as McMurphy, Big Nurse, Nurse Pilbow and several Acutes go down, arms and legs intertwined, kicking, trying to get away as McMurphy strangles Big Nurse. 
Nurse Pilbow screaming, as Washington, Warren, Miller rush in, trying to break his hold on Big Nurse's throat, her face turning blue. McMurphy's face, twisted by his passion, when Washington lands a rabbit punch and MeMurphy's face relaxes as he passes out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
MUSIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER. The day room is as it was in the beginning. Harding is dealing out a game of blackjack to Martini, 
Scanlon, Cheswick and Fredrickson. 
Taber, pencil in band, sits pondering over a blank sheet of paper. 
Ruckly is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. 
Bancini sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, "Tired... awful tired..." Ellis stands against the wall, arms outstretched. 
HARDING (V.O.) (over last scene, in McMurphy's style) Okay, suckers, place your bets... 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Bromden is mopping the floor near the security gate to the visitors' room, when a key hits the lock. Bromden looks up expectantly. 
BROMDEN'S POV 
as Sefelt and Miller enter the visitors' room, cross to the security gate and pass into the hallway. Bromden goes back to his mopping. 
INT. DAY ROOM - DAY 
as Sefelt jauntily enters the day room. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (through loudspeaker) Did everything go well, Mister Sefelt? 
Sefelt turns to the nurses' station where, inside, Big Nurse sits very erect, wearing a back brace that reaches up around her neck. Sefelt shows his teeth and gums to Big Nurse. 
BIG NURSE (V.O.) (CONT'D) (through loudspeaker) That's very nice. Now, doesn't that make you feel better, Mister Sefelt? 
SEFELT Yes, ma'am... 
BIG NURSE Good... 
She turns back to her work. 
Sefelt crosses to the card game, where he sits and catches Fredrickson's attention; showing him his teeth. Fredrickson smiles at Sefelt and blows him a kiss. 
HARDING (who has been dealing) Big Ace... a lovely lady... another ace... an' a little trey, hey, hey, whadaya say... hit or sit? 
SCANLON Hit! 
SEFELT (to Fredrickson) Ya know what, Fred? 
FREDRICKSON What? 
HARDING (dealing a card to Scanlon) Big king, too bad... 
SEFELT Just wait till you hear...

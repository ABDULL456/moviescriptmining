{"train": "\"Heathers\" (early), by Daniel Waters \nHEATHERS \nAn Original Screenplay \nby \nDaniel Waters \nREVISED SECOND DRAFT \nRegistered WGAW \nNovember 17, 1987 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.   SUBURBAN STREET--DAY \nVERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit. Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing. \nEXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY \nVERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder. \nEXT.   PROMENADE--DAY \nVERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAY \nReveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home. \nShe painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob. \nINY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY \nVERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she launches into voice-over narration. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Heather told me she teaches people Real Life. \nComposed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the mirror then rambles off. \nINT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY \nContinuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile. \nVERONICA (V.O.) She said Real Life sucks Losers dry. If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly. \nOUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA \nWith her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle. \nVERONICA (V.O.) I said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. She said Yes. \nTHE DIARY PAGE \nVERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice-over. \nVERONICA (V.O.) I said You're Beautiful. \nA sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.) God, come on Veronica! \nVERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA. \nVERONICA What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my... \nHEATHER MCNAMARA God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather. \nFrom behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE. She is clutching a tattered copy of \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" \nHEATHER DUKE Yeah, she really wants to talk to you. \nVERONICA Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus... \nINSIDE THE CAFETERIA \nVERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE, strides into the lunchroom pandemonium. \nThe stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back. \nHEATHER DUKE Yeah, so what's the question? \nHEATHER CHANDLER God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase. \nHEATHER DUKE (hurt) I forgot. \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye. \nVERONICA Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last...... \nHEATHER CHANDLER Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks. \nVERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact. \nTransfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones. \nBETTY Sorry Veronica. \nVERONICA Betty Finn. Gosh..... \nVERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful. \nVERONICA I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month. \nBETTY That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date. \nVERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe. \nVERONICA Don't say that. \nBETTY Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day. \nBETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch. \nVERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor. \nVERONICA I was talking with someone! \nHEATHER CHANDLER Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn. \nTHE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE \nA coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out. \nCOURTNEY Oh great. Here comes Heather. \nCOURTNEY'S FRIEND Shit. \nMARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE \nAlone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it. \nTHE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE \nHEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater. \nCOURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth doing the \"induce-vomiting\" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around. \nCOURTNEY Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance. \nHEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile. \nHEATHER CHANDLER That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do? \nA stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks. \nKEITH That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state. \nVERONICA Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City. \nKEITH Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it. \nCOURTNEY If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent. \nVERONICA You're beautiful. \nTHE FAMINE FUND STAND \nPETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills. \nPETER Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries. \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over. \nVERONICA (V.O.) ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers are the same. Didn't you see The Breakfast Club? \nBETTY FINN'S TABLE \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl in the commercials and the videos. \nJOCKS' TABLE \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) I'm the blonde in the bikini on the horse holding a Pepsi can. \nINT.   SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY \nIn a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER cough toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) I'm the princess being spanked on the throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar. \nINT.   THE SCHOOL LIBRARY \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER click-click across the school library floor to where an ALL-OUT NERD studies in solitude. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.) What do I get out of being friends with losers. I give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with loserness. \nPARKING LOT \nHeavy Metaler MATT grins. \nMATT You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That's got to be the most spooky-ass question I've ever heard. \nBETTY FINN'S TABLE \nBETTY FINN daintily peeps up. \nBETTY FINN I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys. \nJOCKS' TABLE \nRAM sputters out some chicken to bellow. \nRAM I'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though. \nSTONERS' HALLWAY \nA FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops... \nFEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET What? \nLIBRARY \nThe ALL-OUT NERD lashes out. \nALL-OUT NERD This is important. With taxes, I'd be only getting 3.5 million and.... \nPARKING LOT \nHeavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT. \nCLYDE If you want a good way to go out before the aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You and the lion die like as one. \nTwo Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against the windshield blankly respond. \nJACKIE AND STEVE Cool. \nCAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation chugging through another busy cafeteria lane. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest. \nVERONICA Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth? \nHEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Oh God, here we go... \nPOV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK \nJ.D. There are no stupid questions. \nVERONICA If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do? \nJ.D. (suavely) That's the stupidest question I've ever heard. \nJOCKS' TABLE \nThe JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D. \nRAM Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley? \nKURT Veronica is into his act. No doubt. \nRAM Let's kick his ass. \nKURT Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though. \nJ.D.'S TABLE \nAn intrigued J.D. laconically answers the question. \nJ.D. Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach. \nVERONICA How very. \nHEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Come on. \nVERONICA (to J.D.) Later. \nJ.D. Definitely. \nKURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place. RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate. \nRAM You going to eat this? \nKURT What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio? \nRAM Answer him dick! \nKURT Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule? \nJ.D. It seems to have an open door policy for assholes though, doesn't it? \nKURT What did you say dickweed? \nJ.D. I'll repeat myself. \nJ.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a a .357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY \nCroquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard holding different colored mallets next to matching balls. HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something. \nHEATHER CHANDLER He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail. \nVERONICA No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that... (giggling) Can you bleach out urine stains? \nHEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S green one. \nHEATHER CHANDLER J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys. \nVERONICA Never say never. \nHEATHER DUKE What are you going to do, Heather? Take the two shots or send me out? \nThe Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous faces. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I'm always red... \nHEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent green one rocketing into a flower bed. \nHEATHER DUKE Shit. \nHEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (to HEATHER DUKE) Damn. It's your turn Heather. \nHEATHER DUKE No, it's Heather's turn. \nVERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door. \nBRAD How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on. \nVERONICA Hey really, I don't feel so great. \nBRAD Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent. \nBRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing. \nVERONICA I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice.... \nBRAD Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid. \nVERONICA You don't deserve my fucking speech! \nVERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed causing him to slide off onto the floor. \nDORM HALLWAY \nVERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm. \nBRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish. DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set down her beer and walk toward VERONICA. \nDORMITORY ALLEY \nThe fire in the trashcan is raging. \nDORM HALLWAY \nA steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA. \nHEATHER CHANDLER What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze. \nVERONICA Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please? \nHEATHER CHANDLER No. Hell no. \nVERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Betty Finn was a true friend and I sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West. Or is it East? West! I sound like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing her aerobicized ass but tonight let me dream of a world without Heather. A world where I am free. \nDORM HALLWAY \nVERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth. A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss. VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background. \nDORMITORY ALLEY \nVERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius. \nHEATHER CHANDLER You stupid cunt! \nVERONICA You goddamn bitch! \nThe flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light. \nHEATHER CHANDLER You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke! \nVERONICA Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (totally in control) Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps. \nJ.D. Dreadful etiquette. I apologize. \nVERONICA (exhaling deeply) S'okay.... \nJ.D. I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match? \nVERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead.... \nVERONICA Sure. But I'm Blue. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT \nThe viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest together by the first wicket. \nJ.D. holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol. \nJ.D. I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself. \nVERONICA Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her. \nVERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug. \nVERONICA O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon? \nJ.D. Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue. \nJ.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts. \nVERONICA What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that. \nJ.D. Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking. \nJ.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering. \nVERONICA Just give me a cup, jerk. \nJ.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup. \nVERONICA Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something. \nJ.D. Yeah, great. \nThey both start coughing harshly. \nVERONICA No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely. \nJ.D. Chick-en. \nVERONICA You're not funny. \nJ.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs back into view. \nJ.D. I'm sorry. \nJ.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes with a grudging smile. \nVERONICA Bonehead. \nVERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups. \nNot the one with milk and orange juice in it. \nHEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM \nHEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D. enter. \nVERONICA Morning, Heather. \nLike a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation? \nVERONICA We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Did we? How the hell'd you get in here? \nJ.D. Veronica knew you'd have a hangover. So I whipped this up. Family recipe. \nJ.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? I'm not drinking that piss. \nJ.D. I knew this stuff would be too intense. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken. \nThey do. They're right. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Just give me the cup, jerk. \nHEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger. She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. She then launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Corn nuts! \nHEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze. \nJ.D. Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup. \nFRED DEAN Hey Dad, how was work today? \nFRED DEAN slams down his rowing machine and straddles it before answering his own question. He rows as he speaks. The Brady Bunch sputters on the T.V. screen before him. \nFRED DEAN It was miserable. Some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesn't want us to terminate that fleabag hotel. All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It's just like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas? \nJ.D. That was the one with the wheat right? \nBIG BUD DEAN The Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society. Showed those fucks. \nJ.D. turns to VERONICA with a bemused smile. \nJ.D. Thirty Fourth of July fireworks attached to the trunk. Arraigned but Acquitted. \nFRED DEAN Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend. \nJ.D. Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica. \nVERONICA Hello. \nVERONICA, with a forced smile, reaches to shaked FRED's hand. FRED DEAN extends his hand but makes no effort to stop rowing hence his hand pulls away from VERONICA. Pop and son laugh. \nJ.D. Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner. \nVERONICA (awkwardly standing) My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. \nJ.D. Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad? \nBIG BUD DEAN stops rowing to grin a You-Think-You're-Tougher- Than-Me-But-You're-Not smile to J.D. \nBIG BUD DEAD Right, son. \nVERONICA (weakly) Right. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER PATIO--DUSK \nJust as in the earlier patio scene, DAD and MOM SAWYER are seated at a patio table with an empty chair between them. Pate is on the table. DAD smokes a cigarette. \nDAD Take a break Veronica, sit down. \nVERONICA walks into view and sits down. \nVERONICA All right. \nDAD So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like? \nVERONICA I don't know, it was okay, I guess. \nMOM Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender? \nVERONICA Maybe. \nDAD (looking at his cigarette) Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things? \nVERONICA (smiling) Because you're an idiot. \nDAD Oh yeah, that's it. \nDAD immediately takes another drag with a wide grin. \nMOM (shaking her head) You two.... \nVERONICA Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow. \nINT.   HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--DAY \nA montage commences showing the HEATHERS preparing for the funeral. HEATHER MCNAMARA models an all-black outfit in front of a dressing table mirror. She storms away, pouting. \nINT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM--DAY \nBobbing up from a fashion magazine whose cover story is FUNERAL CHIC, HEATHER DUKE finishes applying black lipstick. A look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs her lips. \nINT.   CHURCH--DAY \nA MORTICIAN puts the finishing touches on HEATHER CHANDLER, smoothing out her clothes and buffing her face. He gently kisses her forehead then quickly rebuffs the spot. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM \nHEATHER MCNAMARA models another black outfit. She responds this time with a satisfied smile. \nHEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM \nTraditionally made up, a smiling HEATHER DUKE brings a crucifix earring to her ear and attaches it. \nRAM pushes BRACES down harder. \nKURT Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks. \nRODNEY Leave him alone, Kurt. \nJ.D. rides by on his motorcycle. He turns to watch KURT, wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that reads THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked. \nRAM (O.S.) Say it! \nBRACES Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks. \nUnamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries. \nBRACES I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm! I can't get enough of them. Satisfied? \nKURT I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that. (with a lisp) Right, guys? \nANOTHER PLACE IN THE PARKING LOT \nVERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA sashay through the parking lot. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet lately, consoling me and stuff. It'll be really very. Promise. \nMoving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off his face as his friends glumly watch on. \nVERONICA All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows. \nEXT.   COW PASTURE--NIGHT \nA COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on. \nKURT Is it sleeping, dude? \nRAM I think so, man. \nKURT Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest. \nRAM Punch it in! \nKURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but VERONICA glares it away. \nKURT Count of three, guy. \nKURT AND RAM One. Two. Three! \nAn O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA. \nDEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT \nKURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA. \nKURT \"When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing.....\" \nVERONICA Yeah, right, asshole. \nVERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline. Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT squints up the hill and falls over backwards. \nJ.D. What is this shit? \nVERONICA I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off. \nKURT (still face down) \"Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love.\" \nJ.D. Another fucking Heather. (harshly laughs) I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss Popularity.. \nVERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill. \nVERONICA So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus! \nJ.D. Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee. \nJ.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn, takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill. \nKURT \"And she's buying the stairway to heaven..\" \nINT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY \nIn a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and a YEARBOOK GIRL, wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, confer over a layout sheet. Dennis's Famine Fund partner PETER DAWSON pouts behind them. \nDENNIS I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it. \nPETER Great. Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon. \nJ.D. Do you take German? \nVERONICA French. \nJ.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber. \nJ.D. These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm. \nVERONICA So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding. \nJ.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring. \nJ.D. We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. The note's the punchline. How'd it turn out? \nVERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both papers. \nVERONICA First tell me this similarity is not incredible. \nJ.D. (warmly) Incredible similarity. \nVERONICA pulls back the note and reads. \nVERONICA Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole. \nJ.D. Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word. \nVERONICA We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play. \nJ.D. (rapid-fire) They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce. \nVERONICA Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K. \nVERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her. \nJ.D. It doesn't work on small animals! \nVERONICA Oh. \nJ.D. Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed. \nJ.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the contents on the bed. \nJ.D. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. \nVERONICA You must have had fun. \nJ.D. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... \nJ.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises out two bottles of Perrier water. \nJ.D. Perrier water! \nVERONICA Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way. \nJ.D. This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress. \nVERONICA (mock-seductively) Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go? \nJ.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss. \nEXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT \nA tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk through the parking lot toward the woods. \nRAM (singing) Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and... \nKURT Shut the fuck up, all right. \nRAM Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in! \nKURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM. \nEXT.   CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT \nVEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods. She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods. \nKURT Hi Veronica. \nVERONICA (forced cheerfulness) Hi Guys. Glad you could make it. \nRAM smacks his hands together. \nRAM So do we just start fucking? \nThe two officer explode out of the car. \nTHE CLEARING \nJ.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun. \nVERONICA Kurt doesn't look too good. \nJ.D. Remember he's left-handed. \nA quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand. \nMILNER (O.S.) Keep going until you hit the clearing! \nJ.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop. \nMcCORD Mother of Shit! \nMILNER Call in! \nMILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out. \nMILNER I heard something out there. I'm checking it out. \nMILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is holding the pulse of KURT KELLY. \nMcCORD This is Officer McCord and I've got two dead bodies in the woods behind Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback. \nIN THE WOODS \nVERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos. \nANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS \nMILNER blindly barrels through the woods. \nJUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS \nVERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top. \nJ.D. Faster! \nIN THE WOODS \nMILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving. \nTHE HILL \nVERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting. \nMILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill. \nTHE SAWYER CAR \nVERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin taking off their clothes. \nTHE HILL \nMILNER continues to move up the hill. \nTHE SAWYER CAR \nVERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace. \nOUTSIDE THE CAR \nMILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie- talkie startles him. \nMcCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie) Milner, can you hear me? What's going down? \nMILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie. \nMILNER Think what I heard was just a stinking owl. All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry them apart? \nMcCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie) Forget it. I got all the answers back here, partner. \nTHE SAWYER CAR \nSeeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking. \nTHE CLEARING \nMILNER runs back into the clearing. \nHEATHER DUKE Ah, young love. \nThe SQUEALING GIRL bounds up to the Heathers. \nSQUEELING GIRL Did you hear? School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact. \nHEATHER DUKE (incredulous, but amused) No way! \nTHE SAWYER CAR \nJ.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket. \nJ.D. Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes. \nVERONICA (looking to her burnt hand) Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral? \nSTUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out. \nEXT.   CEMETERY GROUNDS--DAY \nA typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY, stands over his son's open grave. FATHER FAUST and a seated mixture of ADULTS and STUDENTS watch on. \nMR. KELLY If there's any way you can hear me, Kurt buddy, I don't care that you really were some pansy. You're my flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son's gay and I love him! \nIn dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D. \nVERONICA Your son's dead and you love him. \nJ.D. How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse? \nThey quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her. She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is soaked in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated grimace. \nINT.  SAWYER LIVING ROOM--NIGHT \nStill in stylish funeral garb and dark sunglasses, VERONICA collapses onto her couch, splaying next to her MOM. The Sawyer T.V. flashes against Veronica's shades. \nMOM How was the funeral? \nVERONICA (deadpan) Superb. \nA young, statuesque blonde appears on-screen. A Super reading WHITNEY JAMES-W.E.T.C. COMMENTARY flashes on. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) It looks like the teen suicide epidemic has hit home in Sherwood as the death toll at Westerburg High rockets to three. \nA shiny number three flashes on and off in the screen's corner. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert \"Ram\" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope. \nVERONICA That's three things. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary. \nThe camera pans to an affable ANCHORMAN. \nANCHORMAN (T.V.) Thanks Whitney, but I hate to say it. It looks like you brought that rainy weather back with you. Tomorrow's forecast calls for... \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nVERONICA lies on the floor next to a Vodka bottle. She drinks out of a Dixie cup as she talks on the phone. \nVERONICA No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye. \nVERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen. She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. \nSitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup. \nVERONICA (V.O.) The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing.... \nVERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber. \nTHE CAFETERIA \nSTUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars. \nPAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high. \nPAULINE Peter, kill the jukebox. \nAs the jukebox amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up a bullhorn to her lips and crackles... \nPAULINE Could I have your attention? \nJ.D. You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly's ass away! \nVERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a framed picture of a woman, at the roaring J.D. \nVERONICA You can be so immature! \nJ.D. (looking off) You kids are making too much damn noise. \nFRED DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway, holding a chest exerciser and waving a videocassette. \nFRED DEAN We beat the bitches. \nVERONICA (mumbling) Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home. \nFRED DEAN Judge told em to slurp shit and die. \nFRED DEAN crams the cassette in his V.C.R. and hefts up a chest exerciser. He begins pumping away as the image of a shabby building appears on the massive T.V. \nFRED DEAN I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs. \nThe building blows up. FRED DEAN cackles. J.D. politely applauds. FRED pops out the videocassette and bounces away. \nFRED DEAN It's great to be alive! \nVERONICA Do you like your father? \nJ.D. Never given the matter much thought. Liked my mother. \nJ.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw. \nJ.D. They said her death was an accident. But she knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew... \nVERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern. \nVERONICA Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... \nJ.D. Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? \nVERONICA Maybe. \nJ.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels. \nJ.D. Whoa! Amazing! \nTHE T.V. SCREEN \nA music video flashes on the Dead T.V. screen. THREE GORGEOUS WOMEN, stylishly furnished, evocatively wail the female moans heard throughout the film. The video viewpoint then pans to two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy clothes. They sing/shout before an all-white background. A SUPER in the corner reads BIGFUN/TEENAGE SUICIDE (DON'T DO IT). \nBIGFUN (T.V.) TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW! PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW! \nJ.D. It's the new BigFun video! \nVIDEO:   INT.   A GIRL'S BEDROOM--DAY \nNow in full screen, the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed and very cute, white, female VID VICTIM ONE sitting at her dressing table. She pours a bottle of pills into her hand. \nBIGFUN (V.O.) BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO! \nBIGFUN magically materialize next to VID VICTIM ONE. The pills in her hand have turned into jellybeans. She is ridiculously happy. \nBIGFUN TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! \nJ.D. pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face. \nJ.D. We've made MTV. \nJ.D. fires into the radiant image of BIGFUN, destroying the T.V. and disgusting VERONICA, who bolts off the couch. He raucously crawls after her. \nVERONICA We're breaking up. I am out! \nJ.D. Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor. \nJ.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers. She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit. \nVERONICA You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. \nJ.D. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. \nVERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and eventually into a walking-out-the-door position. \nVERONICA I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... \nJ.D. Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back. \nA Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID. \nDAVID Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody's carpet lately? \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA cringes. \nVERONICA Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing.... \nHEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM \nDAVID What can I say? I was pretty broken up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on? \nHEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM \nDAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap. \nDAVID She can't really talk right now. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away, VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials..... \nVERONICA Hello, Betty..... \nEXT.   SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY \nBETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face. \nBETTY I don't believe it. I'm winning. \nVERONICA Don't get cocky, girl. \nBETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up. \nBETTY I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends. \nVERONICA That's bullshit. Just shoot. \nBETTY once again bends and raises. \nBETTY Ronnie, I'm still a virgin. \nVERONICA (warmly) Shoot. \nBETTY finally shoots. Feebly. \nVERONICA Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked. \nBETTY Ronnie! \nVEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's. \nBETTY Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way. \nVERONICA It's not my style, okay? \nBETTY Nice guys finish last. I should know. \nVERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her. \nHEATHER DUKE Brav-o! \nBETTY FINN (nervously) I've got to get going, Veronica. See you at the studio. \nVERONICA Sure. See ya. \nHEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Croquet won't be the same without Heather. \nHEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN. \nHEATHER DUKE Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios. It's going to be done in the Park. \nBETTY But I thought... \nHEATHER DUKE (heading back) It's going to be like a big picnic. Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED! \nVERONICA I said I was sorry. \nHEATHER DUKE You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers. \nVERONICA You're not funny. Ouch! \nVERONICA rubs her feet. HEATHER DUKS shakes her head. \nHEATHER DUKE (Heather Chandleresque) What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue. \nVERONICA Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on. \nHEATHER DUKE Oh shit, yeah. \nHEATHER DUKE hastens to the radio and flicks it on. Ripping open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to VERONICA as a TROUBLED MALE VOICE cuts the air. \nTROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio) I know it's supposed to be funny that they never get off the island, but still, sometimes I feel like I'm on that island and Gilligan can be just so stupid sometimes. \nHEATHER DUKE This sounds like a good one. \nINT.   RADIO STATION BOOTH \nA slob D.J. cackles into a W.E.T.C. conference call-type box. \nD.J. Dude, you've got to remember if it wasn't for the courage of the fearless crew, the Minnow would be lost. The Minnow would be lost! Next call! \nTROUBLED MALE VOICE But Skipper hates me.... \nThe D.J. rudely clicks off the TROUBLED MALE VOICE. \nD.J. Whoa, they're coming out early tonight. What ever happened to teen pregnancy and acne? You've got the Dogcatcher on W etcetera and you're listening to Hot Probs. Who am I talking to? \nINT.    HEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nHEATHER MCNAMARA is sitting clandestinely on her bedroom floor talking on the phone and through her radio. A dim Minnie Mouse lamp provides the room's only light. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA looks up at a Madonna poster on the wall. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA looks up to her Minnie Mouse lamp. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA and HEATHER DUKE simultaneously move into stunned kneeling positions, half-realizing who the caller is... \nD.J. (radio) Hey babe, I need a name? \nRADIO STATION BOOTH \nThe D.J. looks to the conference call box with exasperation. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA (box) My name is Minnie. \nD.J. Ah, Minnie. Don't tell me, Mickey just confessed he got A.I.D.S. from Goofy at a New Year's Eve Party. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA'S BEDROOM \nA broken-down HEATHER MCNAMARA sobs. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA God has cursed me, I think. The last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I'm failing Math. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nHEATHER DUKE excitedlly jumps up as HEATHER MCNAMARA drones on. \nHEATHER DUKE                 HEATHER MCNAMARA (radio) Holy shit, that's            My whole life is a mess. Heather! We'll               I was supposed to be crucify her!                 captain of the cheerleading team, but I probably won't VERONICA                because I miss practice when Oh man, she knows we         my Dad visits. My parents listen to this show!         are divorced and stuff and.... \nINT.   CLASSROOM--DAY \nA blackboard reads POOR LITTLE HEATHER. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Heather told everyone about Heather. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA is revealed in the front row wearing her cheerleader uniform. To the left, HEATHER DUKE dishes with some dreamy GUYS. At the back of the classroom, VERONICA, monocle in eye, writes in her diary. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather Chandler's head and Heather Duke's head has sprouted in its place like some mythological thing my eighth grade boyfriend would know about. Heather's even doing the old note trick. \nA HOMELY GIRL is seen reading a note, glancing to a TYPICAL JOCK. VERONICA takes in the wicked panorama of the classroom. \nVERONICA (V.O.) I did it J.D.'s way. I did it Pauline's way. Nothing's changed. I guess that's Heather's way. And jesus, what about J.D.? I can't get him out of my head. Are we going to the Prom? Or to Hell? And where's Heather going? \nHEATHER DUKE, petition in hand, sashays toward the Country Club Kids table. \nCOURTNEY Oh great. Here comes Heather. \nCOURTNEY'S FRIEND Shit. \nINT.   SCHOOL BUS--DAY \nHEATHER DUKE chirps to a schoolbusful of various STUDENTS. \nEXT.   BLEACHERS--DAY \nThe provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a bleacher of Jocks. \nSTAIRCASE WINDOW \nHEATHER DUKE continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of the staircase window. \nINT.   FAST FOOD RESTAURANT--NIGHT \nNow in Heavy Metal gear, HEATHER DUKE slams down the petition atop a booth of Metalheads. \nINT.   THE SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY--DAY                                   139 \nDecked out in denim, HEATHER DUKE vanishes into the Stoner Hallway smoke, with the petition. \nTHE STAIRCASE WINDOW \nHEATHER DUKE further writhes in the sunlight until VERONICA's perplexed voice cuts into her bliss. \nVERONICA (O.S.) Heather? \nHEATHER DUKE brings down her arms and the petition and turns to VERONICA, revealed to be descending down the steps. \nHEATHER DUKE Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me! (giggling) My God, you haven't signed! \nVERONICA People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton... \nHEATHER DUKE (verbally winking) So some people need different kinds of \"convincing\" than others.... (happiness evaporating) Hey, just sign the petition! \nVERONICA Don't talk to me like that. \nHEATHER DUKE It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it? \nVERONICA (queasy) No. \nHEATHER DUKE Jealous much? \nVERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE with all her might. \nVERONICA Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch? \nHEATHER DUKE Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh! \nHEATHER DUKE stumbles down the stairs. J.D.'s voice cuts into VERONICA's concentration. \nJ.D. (O.S.) Wanna go out tonight? \nVERONICA grimly turns to see a smirking, descending J.D. \nJ.D. Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? \nVERONICA (jokingly but caustically) I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide. \nJ.D. I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on? \nVERONICA somberly steps forward to J.D., grabs his elbows, then pulls him gently, seemingly for a kiss. She spits in his face and bolts down the stairs, calling up to him. \nVERONICA It's over, J.D.  Over! \nJ.D. I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back! \nINT.   SAWYER LIVING ROOM--DUSK \nIntensely clutching her schoolbooks, VERONICA walks through the front door into the living room where MOM and DAD sit with aggressively compassionate faces. VERONICA is a bit confused. \nVERONICA Yes? \nMOM and DAD glance at each other before MOM speaks. \nMOM Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself. \nDAD You have been depressed lately. Oh, he said this is for you. \nINT.   FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY \nWith even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing \"What a Waste, Oh the Humanity\" T-shirts toss out tons of black armbands into a hungry crowd. \nINT.   FUNERAL HOME--DAY \nThe wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin. FATHER FAUST wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee, walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER FAUST dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking. \nFATHER RIPPER Eskimo. \nFATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up the copy of The Catcher in the Rye. \nFATHER RIPPER Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain. \nVERONICA stands in a corner with an \"Oh brother\" look on her face. \nFATHER RIPPER On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus. \nHEATHER CHANDLER moves next to VERONICA holding a plate of steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral. \nVERONICA Heather? Wha... \nHEATHER CHANDLER Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing \"Kumbaya\" one more time... \nVERONICA What are you doing here?! \nHEATHER CHANDLER I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. \nWith a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into the plate of spaghetti. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Dinner! \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nUncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all been a dream........... \nMOM (O.S.) Dinner! Veronica! Dinner! \nVERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing. \nVERONICA (O.S.) Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A. That is to say, no one but me. I know where J.D. is coming from and where he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going to teach him what's right. I'm going to stop J.D....If it's the last thing I do. \nVERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer. \nEXT.   OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT \nJ.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads toward the house. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER FRONT YARD \nJ.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house. \nINT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE \nMOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on. \nMOM Does she want a written invitation? (yelling upward) Veronica! Dinner! \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nJ.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA. \nINT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE \nMOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed. \nMOM Honey? \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nJ.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in one hand, the Barbie doll in the other. \nJ.D. I can't believe you did it. I was teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed up here to kill you, but first I was going to try and get you back. With amazing petition. \nJ.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks. \nJ.D. It's a shame you can't see what our fellow students really signed. \nVERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers. She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile. \nVERONICA Rodney, where's everybody going? \nRODNEY It's Friday..... \nVERONICA Oh my God, the damn pep assembly.... \nRODNEY Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class... \nVERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd. \nTHE GYM \nJ.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors. He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs. \nTHE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM \nVERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY. \nVERONICA Rodney, what's underneath the gym? \nRODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA. and says........ \nRODNEY The boiler room. \nVERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the staircase beside the gym. \nHALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM \nJ.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly pick the lock. He swings open the steel door. \nVERONICA (O.S.) May I see your hall pass? \nJ.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him, pointing the bedroom gun at him. \nJ.D. I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you! \nVERONICA Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground. \nJ.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer. \nVERONICA Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head. \nJ.D. You didn't say Simon Says. \nJ.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully retrieves it. \nTHE GYM \nThe pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard. Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away. \nTHE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM \nVERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs. J.D. raises the gun to her head. \nJ.D. Live by the sword... \nVERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose. \nThey simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall. VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs scissors-style around her and trips her. \nTHE PREP ASSEMBLY \nThe assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb. \nTHE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY \nA snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him. \nJ.D. You think just because you started this thing, you can end it? \nJ.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps. \nJ.D. You, really didn't think I'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the.... \nVERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D. grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door. \nA jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58... \nTHE PEP ASSEMBLY \nThe frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing \"The Wave\". BETTY FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd. \n", "test1_input": "HEATHER CHANDLER Corn nuts! \nINT.   7-11 \nStylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her. \nJ.D. (O.S.) You going to pull a Big Gulp with that? \nVERONICA No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. \nJ.D. I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane. \nVERONICA Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. \nJ.D. The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee? \nVERONICA I didn't. Cherry. \nVERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile. \n7-11 PARKING LOT \nVERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle. \nVERONICA Great bike. \nHEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace. VERONICA glares at her then turns back to J.D. \nJ.D. Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? \nVERONICA I don't know. Should you? \nJ.D. My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? \"Bringing every State to a Higher State.\" \nVERONICA Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place. \nJ.D. Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect? \nVERONICA (gently joking) Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University. \nVERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again. \nVERONICA It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends. \nJ.D. I don't really like your friends either. \nVERONICA It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. \nJ.D. Maybe it's time for a vacation. \nThe car horn blares again. \nINT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT \nDAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door. \nThe semi-handsome BRAD leans aainst a desk while a WHINING STUDENT talks with COED ONE who sits on the floor. \nDAVID Throw your coats on the bed, girls. \nWHINING STUDENT That exam was so bogus. \nCOED ONE Oh I know. Which exam? \nDAVID Veronica, this is Brad. \nBRAD Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers? \nHEATHER CHANDLER Yeah, let's party. \nDAVID She loves to party. \nAs they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in BRAD'S FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh. \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nThe viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing monocled VERONICA writes at her desk. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Dear Diary, I want to kill and you have to believe.....damn pen! \nVERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write. She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another. \nVERONICA (V.O.) You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons. More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle. You have to believe me. \n", "test1_true": "The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music. VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS. \nBRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door. \nBRAD So, are you a cheerleader? \nVERONICA (dealing with a jerk) No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one. \nVERONICA Gee, thanks. \nBRAD It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask \"What's your major?\" I hate that. \nThey uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues. \nBRAD So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study? \nINT.   DAVID'S DORM ROOM \nHEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters. They kiss. DAVID doing most of the work. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Come on David, let's go back to the party. \nDAVID (unzipping his pants) Don't worry, we will. You're just so hot tonight. I can't control myself. \nDAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down. \nDORM HALLWAY \nBRAD has given up on conversation. \nBRAD So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party. I've got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the dorm. \nA BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust. \nBIG AMIABLE STUDENT Brad-man, Robinson's looking for you. He says he owes you for blow and he just got some product himself. \nBRAD You're kidding. That pecker actually scored something on his own? \nBIG AMIABLE STUDENT (ambling off) He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up. \nBRAD Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine? \nVERONICA Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything. \nBRAD Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving? \nVERONICA Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? \nBRAD Hey, don't run away now. \nWith a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room with the coats. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA rampages through her diary. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the Twinkies. When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you lose something. Not innocence--power. \nJ.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary. \nVERONICA J.F.K.! \nVERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University assholes have chosen to ignore. I understand I must stop Heather. \nDORM \"COAT\" ROOM \nPanting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the \"coat\" room. She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair. \nVERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches. With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window. \nEXT.   ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY  NIGHT \nThe flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread... \nINT.   DORMITORY BATHROOM  NIGHT \nA dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some water and then spits it at her own reflection. \nTHE DORM \"COAT\" ROOM \n", "test2_input": "PAULINE I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything I've taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note! \nPAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS. \nMALE STUDENT All right! \nPAULINE I'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin? \nFEMALE STUDENT I heard it was really gnarly. She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed.... \nPAULINE Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions. \nTHE ALL-OUT NERD Are we going to be tested on this? \nA stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks. The note continues to be breathlessly passed around. \nPETER Heather and I used to go together, but she said I was boring. I realize now I wasn't really boring. She was just dissatisfied with her life. \nPAULINE That's very good Peter. \nVERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by putting her hands over her face. \nPAULINE Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share. \nVERONICA Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness. \nThe class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience. \nVERONICA She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death. \nPAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles. \nINT.   THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY \nThe GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour. \nHEATHER DUKE Write the School Board. \nHEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks. \nVERONICA Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Yeah, where's your urge to purge? \nHEATHER DUKE (belching) Fuck it. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Look, heather left behind one of her Swatches. She'd want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you couldn't accessorize for shit. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET stops next to their bench. \nFEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET I'm sorry about your friend. I thought she was your usual airhead bitch. Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were. \nHEATHER DUKE bobs up from the world's largest sno-cone. \nHEATHER DUKE What a waste. \nVERONICA zombiesquely moves into the shower area. \nHEATHER DUKE (V.O.) Oh the Humanity. \nTHE SHOWER \nVERONICA turns on a shower and lets the water spray against her clothes. \nTHE LOCKER ROOM \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Veronica, what are you doing? \nSQUEALING GIRL Everyone in the shower! \nThe SQUEALING GIRL runs into the shower fully clothed. TWO GIGGLING GIRLS follow suit. The HEATHERS look to each other, laugh, and run in. \nINT.   THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE \nHeavy Metalers MATT, CLYDE, and STEVE plus Geek RODNEY sneak into a darkened room. Girls' laughter drifts in. \nMATT Do I deliver or do I deliver? \nRODNEY Hurry up, we're going to get caught. \n", "test2_true": "CLYDE Let's see some pussy! \nMATT pulls a curtain revealing a semi-overhead view of the showering and clothed GIRLS. \nTHE SHOWER \nThe GIRLS splash and spin in balletlike slow motion. VERONICA stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached. \nTHE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE \nCautiously quiet pandemonium. \nMATT Does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit? \nCLYDE (dazed) What the fuck? \nRODNEY We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I can feel it. \nCLYDE What the fuck? \nSTEVE Do you deliver or do you deliver? \nEXT.   OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL--DAY \nPulling their coats over their wet clothes, VERONICA and the HEATHERS come out of the school. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA That was seriously warped, Veronica. \nVERONICA Uh-huh. \nHEATHER DUKE T.V. cameras! \nIn the distance, a T.V. CAMERA CREW is interviewing STUDENTS. HEATHER DUKE dashes toward them. HEATHER MCNAMARA freezes. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes! \nHEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a nearby trashcan. \nINT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON \nA massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE posed by a tree, talking into a microphone. \nHEATHER DUKE (T.V.) I choose to remember the good times. Like when we got our ears pierced at the mall. \nThe image of HEATHER MCNAMARA sitting in the grass talking into a microphone supersedes HEATHER DUKE's. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.) I can still hear those late night talks on the phone. \nThe image of PETER DAWSON sitting on a rock comes on next. \nPETER (T.V.) The day I won her that stuffed rhino at the 4-H Fair, she said to me.... \nVERONICA (O.S.) You're an asshole! Mute him! \nVERONICA and J.D. are seen to be crashed on a couch. J.D. pushes a button on the remote control, cutting the sound. \nJ.D. Mute! \nVERONICA Next channel, darling. \nThe silent image of HEATHER DUKE on a staircase talking into a microphone is on the screen. \nVERONICA (O.S.) Heather, how many networks did you run to! \nCountry Club Courtney appears wearing a T-shirt reading BIGFUN. VERONICA takes the remote and turns the sound on. \nVERONICA Oh, I have to hear this. \nCOURTNEY (T.V.) In my heart, Heather's still alive. \nVERONICA (muting Courtney) What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! (to J.D.) What are you smiling at? \nJ.D. Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now. \nVERONICA Yeah. Scary stuff. \nJ.D. suddenly looks away from VERONICA with a mischievous half-smile. He inexplicably calls out. \nJ.D. Why son, I didn't hear you come in. \nJ.D.'s father FRED DEAN, stands before them, handsome and threatening in a shirt and tie. He is rather malevolently holding a rowing machine. \n", "test3_input": "THE NEWS SET \nVERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES. \nVERONICA I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering. \nWHITNEY JAMES Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up. \nWHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews. \nWHITNEY JAMES I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their birthday, they're still quote-unquote depressed. It's ridiculous. People who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop. \nWHITNEY JAMES titters. VERONICA is a statue of mortification. \nEXT.   THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT \nIn the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad. EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket. \nCLYDE What the fuck? \nNEWS SET \nCompletely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone. \nVERONICA The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness. \nWHITNEY JAMES Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda. \nVERONICA It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up. \nWHITNEY JAMES Sure. Ciao. \nSTUDIO FLOOR \nSickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air. \nPAULINE Everyone take their places on the stage! (to Veronica) Isn't this thrilling?! \nVERONICA But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right. \nPAULINE What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch. (shouting upward) Could we get some more light up here? \nTHE STAGE \nThe pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage. Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar. \nVERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar. \nPAULINE Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. Let's fuse them back together through love. Let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove. \nThe students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage. \nPAULINE (O.S.) Let's begin a new happiness... \nVERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES. \nPAULINE ...with no more suicide... \nSTUDENTS (eeriely) Oh yeah... \nRipping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D. He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast. \nJ.D. Holy traumatic experiences, Batman. I'm sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. I told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in the past already, right? \nPAULINE No more problems.... \nDevastated,  VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console. \nVERONICA Oh yeah. \nVERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES. \nJ.D. Cute. \nWHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before coolly leaning over to her microphone. \nWHITNEY JAMES Let's go for another take. \nOUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS \nVERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types. \nEXT.  OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT \n", "test3_true": "GRAVELLY ROAD \nShe sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound against sharp pebbles. \nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK \nVERONICA now barrels through the neighborhood park. She looks to her outcast classmates. In tableau, they stare back. BETTY FINN on a park carousel spins in and out of view. \nPROMENADE \nVERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the ticket window to a bored female cashier. \nCASHIER Bargain matinees are for the first show only. \nMARTHA Oh, I forgot. \nMARTHA puts two crumpled bucks through the window. The CASHIER shines a cruelly patronizing smile. \nINT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--NIGHT \nVERONICA huffs and puffs into her family room where her MOM and DAD are watching T.V. \nDAD Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go? \nVERONICA Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep. \nMOM I don't know what you're talking about, honey, but can it wait a bit. We're watching this special program on Teen Problems. \nVERONICA half-bitterly laughs at the irony. \nINT.  MOVIE THEATRE \nThe light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen MARTHA. She moves her leg and knocks a large Coke across the floor. She tragically stares at the Cola pool. \nSAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM \nA DAN RATHER VOICE booms from the T.V. The SAWYERS stare. \nDAN RATHER VOICE (O.S.) Oh sure, I'll bet even back when I went to school there were drugs, even sex, but they were simpler times. The Sherwood suicides tell the bitter truth of today's young. What a waste...Oh \nVERONICA snaps off the T.V. \nMOM Turn that back on! \nVERONICA This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life. \nDAD If we're not going to watch that program, can I put on the game? \nMOM Are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled time for the nation's youth? \nVERONICA Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern. \nMOM I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes? \nVERONICA All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized. \nDAD I don't patronize bunny rabbits. \nMOM Treated like human beings? Is that what you said little Miss Voice of a Generation? Just how do you think adults act with other adults? You think it's all just Doubles Tennis. Adults can be horrible to other adults. When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings. \nVERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile. \nVERONICA I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being. \nMOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile. \nMOM You'll live. Want some pate? \nHEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room. \nHEATHER DUKE Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car. \nVERONICA (repulsed) Is she dead? \nHEATHER DUKE That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate? \nVERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face. \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nHEATHER DUKE paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw. VERONICA is on the ground wiping off her bloodied feet. \n"}

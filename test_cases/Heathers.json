{"test1_input": "HEATHER DUKE Yeah, so what's the question? \nHEATHER CHANDLER God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase. \nHEATHER DUKE (hurt) I forgot. \nVERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye. \nVERONICA Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last...... \nHEATHER CHANDLER Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks. \nVERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact. \nTransfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones. \nBETTY Sorry Veronica. \nVERONICA Betty Finn. Gosh..... \nVERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful. \nVERONICA I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month. \nBETTY That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date. \nVERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe. \nVERONICA Don't say that. \nBETTY Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day. \nBETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch. \nVERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor. \nVERONICA I was talking with someone! \nHEATHER CHANDLER Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn. \nTHE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE \nA coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out. \nCOURTNEY Oh great. Here comes Heather. \nCOURTNEY'S FRIEND Shit. \nMARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE \nAlone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it. \nTHE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE \nHEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater. \nCOURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth doing the \"induce-vomiting\" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around. \nCOURTNEY Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance. \nHEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile. \nHEATHER CHANDLER That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do? \nA stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks. \nKEITH That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state. \nVERONICA Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City. \nKEITH Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it. \nCOURTNEY If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent. \nVERONICA You're beautiful. \nTHE FAMINE FUND STAND \nPETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills. \nPETER Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries. \n", "test1_true": "PETER Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat. If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie. \nCAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE \nHEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane. \nHEATHER CHANDLER If you're going to openly be a bitch.... \nVERONICA (submissive) I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? \nHEATHER CHANDLER Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad. \nShe points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both. \nTHE GEEKS' TABLE \nThe GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY splatters milk over himself. \nRODNEY Did you see that? Heather Number One looked right at us. \nBIG CYNIC It must be love. \nCAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE \nVERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER. \nVERONICA Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna? \nHEATHER CHANDLER Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior. \nVERONICA Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims. \nHEATHER CHANDLER (giving in) Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school. \nMARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE \nHer sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the note. \nTHE GEEKS' TABLE \nThe nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers. \nGEEK WITH BRACES No seriously, I'd probably go to the Pyrimads. With a girl. \nGEEK WITH GLASSES Where you going to get a girl, stud? K-Mart? \nBIG CYNIC Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart. \nBRACES Geez, forget it. \nVERONICA What about you Rodney? \nRODNEY (quietly to the others) I told you she knew my name. (beat of contemplation) I'd change my life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home. \nHEATHER CHANDLER How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip. \nVERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table. \nVERONICA If you're going to openly be a bitch.... \nVERONICA again catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY. He wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back. The egg is gone. He smiles. VERONICA smiles back. \nHer trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters. \nHEATHER MCNAMARA God, scan on Martha Dumptruck. \nPOV ON MARTHA \nMARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note. \nHEATHER CHANDLER This is the part I hate. The waiting. I'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come on, Veronica. \nHEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a moment to react. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Veronica? \nVERONICA follows the leader. She calls out. \nVERONICA Damn.. \nEXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT \n", "test1_id": 1335, "test2_input": "HEATHER DUKE Ah, young love. \nThe SQUEALING GIRL bounds up to the Heathers. \nSQUEELING GIRL Did you hear? School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact. \nHEATHER DUKE (incredulous, but amused) No way! \nTHE SAWYER CAR \nJ.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket. \nJ.D. Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes. \nVERONICA (looking to her burnt hand) Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral? \nSTUDENTS head back to their cars and the Buses pull back out. \nEXT.   CEMETERY GROUNDS--DAY \nA typically John Waynesque Jock's Father-type, MR. KELLY, stands over his son's open grave. FATHER FAUST and a seated mixture of ADULTS and STUDENTS watch on. \nMR. KELLY If there's any way you can hear me, Kurt buddy, I don't care that you really were some pansy. You're my flesh-and-blood. You made me proud. I love my homosexual son. My son's gay and I love him! \nIn dark sunglasses, VERONICA wearily leans over to J.D. \nVERONICA Your son's dead and you love him. \nJ.D. How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse? \nThey quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her. She is wearing Kurt's football jersey and her face is soaked in tears. VERONICA's smile turns into a nauseated grimace. \nINT.  SAWYER LIVING ROOM--NIGHT \nStill in stylish funeral garb and dark sunglasses, VERONICA collapses onto her couch, splaying next to her MOM. The Sawyer T.V. flashes against Veronica's shades. \nMOM How was the funeral? \nVERONICA (deadpan) Superb. \nA young, statuesque blonde appears on-screen. A Super reading WHITNEY JAMES-W.E.T.C. COMMENTARY flashes on. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) It looks like the teen suicide epidemic has hit home in Sherwood as the death toll at Westerburg High rockets to three. \nA shiny number three flashes on and off in the screen's corner. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert \"Ram\" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope. \nVERONICA That's three things. \nWHITNEY JAMES (T.V.) It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary. \nThe camera pans to an affable ANCHORMAN. \nANCHORMAN (T.V.) Thanks Whitney, but I hate to say it. It looks like you brought that rainy weather back with you. Tomorrow's forecast calls for... \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nVERONICA lies on the floor next to a Vodka bottle. She drinks out of a Dixie cup as she talks on the phone. \nVERONICA No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye. \nVERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen. She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing. \nVERONICA (V.O.) Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. \nSitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup. \nVERONICA (V.O.) The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing.... \nVERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber. \nTHE CAFETERIA \nSTUDENTS eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. All are wearing black armbands. A jukebox roars. \nPAULINE FLEMING and an entourage of STUDENTS such as PETER DAWSON and the HEATHERS invade the cafeteria, heads raised high. \nPAULINE Peter, kill the jukebox. \nAs the jukebox amusingly grinds to a halt, PAULINE hoists up a bullhorn to her lips and crackles... \nPAULINE Could I have your attention? \n", "test2_true": "STUDENTS whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria. MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK warily looks up from her plate. \nPAULINE FLEMING chants with soaring self-importance. \nPAULINE Our school has been torn apart by tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it back together through love! I want everyone to clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit. Let's begin a new happiness! \nA tableau of dumbfounded STUDENTS stare at the Bullhorn Woman. \nINT.   MAIN HALLWAY--SAME TIME \nHungover in dark sunglasses, VERONICA stumbles down the hall. She stops to read a sign plastered on a wall: THE NEW HAPPINESS- A Special Lunchtime Announcement Ala Pauline Fleming. VERONICA takes off her sunglasses, squints, then continues down the hall. \nTHE CAFETERIA \nPAULINE's Evita Peron-like composure is crumbling. \nPAULINE Yo, what's the problem? I know you know how to hold hands. Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it! I'm just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including Westerburg. \nCheers raucously emerge from the enlivened students. \nPAULINE Let's show the world Westerburg is a diverse happy home, not Suicide Central! (shrewdly) You know there's some people who say Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on T.V. Is that true? \nThe STUDENTS make loud, scattered rumblings of the word \"No.\" PAULINE hungrily unbuttons her paisley blazer. \nPAULINE No or Hell No? \nSTUDENTS (louder) Hell no! \nFrightened and flustered by the fanatic camaraderie around her, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes for a moment then crawls underneath her table. \nPAULINE I can't hear you.... \nFingering her bangs in an attempt at composure, VERONICA steps into the cafeteria and her fellow students boom. \nSTUDENTS HELL NO! \nAs a blown away VERONICA takes in the panorama of students from different cliques chanting to the beat of PAULINE's gospel recital, PAULINE's voice is replaced on the soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene. \nJ.D., also wearing a black armband, stalks VERONICA from behind. His hand unzips her dress. \nThe female voices swell louder as a glowing VERONICA takes in glorious images. Geek BRACES and a JOCK chant together, standing on chairs. HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEAVY METALER MATT look to each other dubiously then mindlessly shout out. A MORRISONESQUE STONER dances on a table of cheering BETTY-FINN-A-LIKES. \nJ.D. slides his hand through the opening in Veronica's dress. The female voices cut off as the spell over VERONICA breaks. She swings her elbow into J.D.'s stomach. \nVERONICA Can't you see this is a special moment? \nJ.D. I was just making it more special. \nPAULINE (O.S.) Veronica, there you are! \nVERONICA spins to an electric PAULINE FLEMING glistening in the mouth of the cafeteria, flanked by HEATHER DUKE and PETER DAWSON. \nPAULINE You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special. Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture. \nJ.D. looks out through the cafeteria. He sees Martha poke her head out from beneath her lunch table then dart back under. J.D. moves away from the chattering group. \nPETER Westerburg? A happy family? \nPAULINE I'm sure you'll work something out. \nHEATHER DUKE (wickedly) Don't worry. We'll work something out. \nVERONICA Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.? \nMARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE \nMARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and head down, trys to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks up and freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her, behind his Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly. \nJ.D. Greetings and salutations. \nINT.   J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT \nVERONICA beams and babbles over the room while on the couch, J.D. restlessly works his channel changer. \nVERONICA You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience. \nJ.D. She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes. \nVERONICA Don't even talk about that stuff! \nJ.D. comically cups his hands together to holler. \n", "test2_id": 1336, "test3_input": "INT.   FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY \nWith even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing \"What a Waste, Oh the Humanity\" T-shirts toss out tons of black armbands into a hungry crowd. \nINT.   FUNERAL HOME--DAY \nThe wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin. FATHER FAUST wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee, walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER FAUST dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking. \nFATHER RIPPER Eskimo. \nFATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up the copy of The Catcher in the Rye. \nFATHER RIPPER Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain. \nVERONICA stands in a corner with an \"Oh brother\" look on her face. \nFATHER RIPPER On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus. \nHEATHER CHANDLER moves next to VERONICA holding a plate of steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral. \nVERONICA Heather? Wha... \nHEATHER CHANDLER Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing \"Kumbaya\" one more time... \nVERONICA What are you doing here?! \nHEATHER CHANDLER I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. \nWith a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into the plate of spaghetti. \nHEATHER CHANDLER Dinner! \nINT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nUncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all been a dream........... \nMOM (O.S.) Dinner! Veronica! Dinner! \nVERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing. \nVERONICA (O.S.) Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A. That is to say, no one but me. I know where J.D. is coming from and where he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going to teach him what's right. I'm going to stop J.D....If it's the last thing I do. \nVERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer. \nEXT.   OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT \nJ.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads toward the house. \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nVERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie. \nEXT.   THE SAWYER FRONT YARD \nJ.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house. \nINT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE \nMOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on. \nMOM Does she want a written invitation? (yelling upward) Veronica! Dinner! \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nJ.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA. \nINT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE \nMOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed. \nMOM Honey? \nVERONICA'S BEDROOM \nJ.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in one hand, the Barbie doll in the other. \nJ.D. I can't believe you did it. I was teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed up here to kill you, but first I was going to try and get you back. With amazing petition. \nJ.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks. \nJ.D. It's a shame you can't see what our fellow students really signed. \n", "test3_true": "J.D. Listen. \"We students of Westerburg High will die. Today. Our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society that degrades is. Fuck you all.\" Not that subtle but neither's blowing up the school. Talk about your suicide pacts. When our school explodes tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation. A Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we coulda toasted marshmallows together. \nMOM (O.S.) Honey, are you all right in there? \nJ.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window. MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter, launches into frantic screams. \nMOM Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my baby back! I should have let you keep that job at the mall. I was just afraid of you coming home alone at night! \nVERONICA opens her eyes. \nMOM I made your favorite! Spaghetti! Lots of oregano! \nVERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist- knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM. \nVERONICA Hey Mom, why so tense? \nTHE SAWYER DINNER TABLE \nMontage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her. \nINT.   J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT \nJ.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D. turns down his stereo (and the Montage music). \nFRED DEAN (O.S.) I need some help with my homework... \nJ.D. Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy.... \nJ.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music). \nEXT.   FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING \nThe Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front of the school. STUDENTS pour out. \nEXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING \nSTUDENTS come out of their cars. \nINT.   HALLWAY--MORNING \nTypically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of- locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her locker. A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee. \nPAULINE Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night! \nVERONICA Where is he? Where's J.D.? \nPAULINE We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make. \nVERONICA Get a job. \nVERONICA storms away to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes. \nIn the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman. \nVERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into the Boys bathroom. \nBOYS BATHROOM \nJ.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music. \nTHE HALLWAY \nThe hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway. \nVERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her. \nTHE GYM \nA group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs. PRINCIPAL GOWAN says \"Testing\" into a microphone. \nJ.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers. \nTHE HALLWAY \nVERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway. \nUNDER THE BLEACHERS \nUsing heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can be discerned taped to other supports. \nTHE EMPTY HALLWAY \n", "test3_id": 1337}

BILLY No. (a beat) You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever. 
MADOLYN What do you expect from coming here? 
BILLY I have to come here. 
MADOLYN I know it's not elective...on your part...but, now that you're here, what do you want? 
BILLY You want the truth? (a beat) Valium. 
MADOLYN If you lied, you'd have an easier time getting what you wanted. 
BILLY What's that say about what you do for a living? 
Madolyn is taken aback. She closes her file. 
MADOLYN Look, I think we better have a few more meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions. 
She closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her. 
BILLY I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
MADOLYN Is this true? 
BILLY Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here. 
MADOLYN Yes, you are. 
BILLY If only fuckin' here. 
She retrieves his folder. 
BILLY (CONT'D) (giving into stress) Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs. Fuckin' Doctor?) 
MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY looks at it. 
BILLY (CONT'D) Two pills. 
She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills on the desk. 
BILLY (CONT'D) Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit? 
MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished. 
MADOLYN You can leave! 
BILLY What if that was a legitimate threat? (Hot shot). 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) 
BILLY leaves. MADOLYN stares after him. 
MADOLYN Fuck... 
EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY 
Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches up to him. 
MADOLYN Why is the hardest patient of the day always the last one? 
BILLY Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural. 
MADOLYN Look, I'm not just...somebody you have to see or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you. 
Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card. 
BILLY What's this? 
MADOLYN My card. And a prescription for twenty Lorazepam. 
BILLY stands holding the prescription. 
BILLY Is it enough to kill myself? 
MADOLYN (she fixes him with a stare) Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don't like my initial clinical reaction. 
BILLY (re: prescription) Thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MADOLYN I'm transferring you to another counselor. 
She starts to go back inside. 
BILLY You wanna get a cup of coffee? 
INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER 
It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present, very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin. 
ELLERBY All right, let's bring it in, please. Come in please. (addressing room) Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team... (he nods at COLIN) Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones. 
COLIN (to his guys) Did you guys know anything about this? 
No. 
ELLERBY (to LAZIO) How long have we been tapped on this building? 
ELLERBY (CONT'D) Our unit will not take action until a man Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction. Questions? Anyone? This is who we're after. (taps picture of Costello) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ELLERBY (CONT'D) We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him. Get to work. 
ON COLIN as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks about the best way out of this.

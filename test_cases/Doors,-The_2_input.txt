TELEVISION Chicago Seven in it's tenth day... Bobby Seale gagged and chained... (click) L.A. shootout with Black Panthers... (click) Charles Manson indicted for murder of actress Sharon Tate... (click) U. S. ground troops in Laos and Cambodia... (click) Indians still occupying Alcatraz Island... (click) For the My Lai massacre testified 120 villagers shot by American soldiers in a trench... 
The SONG climaxes into an inner scream of madness. 
JIM & DOORS (CONCLUDE) For the music is your special friend Dance on fire as it intends Music is your only friend Until the end (3) (SCREAM!) 
Silence on Jim. 
JIM (mildly) I think I'm having a nervous breakdown. 
The sound of wind, the backbeat of LA WOMAN flooding in. 
EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 
JIM dangles out on the narrow ledge that circumscribes the 20th floor rooftop -- wind blowing thru his wild hair, the card zooming by like racer lights on Sunset below. The song LA WOMAN continues born from this renewed feeling of danger. 
JIM & DOORS Well I just got into town 'bout an hour ago Took a look around, see which way the wind blow Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows 
PAM screaming for him to come back from the edge as TOM BAKER and MIKE and DOG and a CAMERAMAN film in 16mm. 
PAM JIM! PLEASE GODDAMIT!! COME BACK IN PLEASE!! 
JIM yelling back, as he drinks from a pint of whiskey, enjoying himself enormously. 
JIM Whatcha worried about? I like it out here. 
He feigns a fall. 
PAM NOOOOOO!! 
RAY and SIDDONS arrive, terrified, looking for him. 
JIM (laughing at Pam) Life on the edge baby. Come get me if you love me baby. 
PAM PLEASE GODDAMIT JIM MORRISON I'M NOT GONNA KILL MYSELF FOR YOU. GET IN HERE. 
Jim cracking up with laughter. BAKER, drunk and the FILM CREW love it, swishpanning with a cheap sungun. 
MIKE (dancing) We got it man! Keep going. Great get a two shot. 
BAKER GO ON GET OUT THERE PAM. 
Pam is sufficiently cracked on her own set of drugs to start climbing out onto the ledge, skirts blowing in the wind. 
PAM JIM MORRISON GODDAMIT I LOVE YOU I WANT YOU I NEED YOU. 
Jim moving further along the ledge. 
JIM (raw) YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S BULLSHIT! YOU LOVE ME THEN COME AND GET ME. 
JIM & DOORS (OVER) LA Woman (X2) LA Woman Sunday afternoon (X3) Drive thru your suburbs Into your blues (X2) Into your blue-blue Blues Into your blues 
Siddons and Ray terrified. Is this the night it's finally going to end in a suicide plunge? Ray trying to stop Pam, too late. 
RAY Pam!! Oh shit... get the ambulances man... 
Pam's moving shakily along the ledge, cracked on downers. 
Jim watching her come, amazed at her risk. 
RAY (yelling down) JIM! HELP HER. She's gonna fall. 
TOM Jump! 
He watches, does nothing. 
JIM Come on baby, come on. 
RAY (trying another tack) Jim we gotta finish "LA Woman". 
JIM Don't have an ending Ray. 
Reaches his hand out. She is closer. But shaky. 
RAY (white) They're both gonna die... ARE YOU HAPPY YOU COCKSUCKERS!! 
Ray goes after Tom Baker and the Film Crew. A scuffle. Yelling, shouting, but down below in the intimacy of the ledge, blowing out on the edge, the wind and the world and death. Two crazy children linked on this gothic balcony of the Chateau reach their hands out for each other. 
JIM Come on baby, come on 
PAM (quoting him) "...but one, the most beautiful one of all -- dances in a ring of fire -- 
JIM (raw singing) "I see your hair is burning. If they say I never loved you, you know they are a liar!" 
PAM "...and throws off the challenge with a shrug" 
JIM All the poetry has wolves in it Pam!!! 
She has never been so concentrated, inching closer to him. Her heels overhanging oblivion. 
PAM I don't wanna die with you Jim Morrison, I don't wanna die! 
JIM & DOORS Never saw a woman So alone (X2) So alone -- lone lone 
JIM C'mon Pam, this is it! We'll do it right here! Right now! You and me! 
Ray, Tom, Siddons, Mike, Dog, they all watch in horror, sensing it will happen. They have even stopped filming. Inches... inches. 
He dodges her touch, confused... to the last possible second. Then SHE'S THERE -- in his arms. Her arms latch around him and she hugs him with all her wiry soul.

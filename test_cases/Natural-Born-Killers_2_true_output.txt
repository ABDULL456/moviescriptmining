JUMP CUT: 
MICKEY ...You know, I'm gonna just rip off your dress and squeeze your titties. Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says, 'No you're not. You're gonna eat me...just like the story says.' 
JUMP CUT: 
MICKEY (with a lisp) ...Fairy boat! I knew things were good in here, but I didn't know we had our own Navy. 
JUMP CUT: 
MICKEY ...So this guy wants to take little Johnny's sister to the drive-in. But the mother says, 'Only if you take little Johnny along---' 
JUMP CUT: 
MICKEY ...And the Polish guy says, 'That's nothing. When I get through with my Hanna, I get up, wipe my dick on the curtain, and she hits the roof!' 
JUMP CUT: 
Mickey's pretending he's calming down a hysterical audience. 
MICKEY No...please...thank you...you're too kind...no...please... 
INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY 
Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE - 16mm. 
NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA. 
Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front driving. 
WAYNE (with mouthful of donut) How's it working, Scotty? 
SCOTT (O.S.) Perfecto! 
Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him. 
ROGER Where the fuck's the chocolate cream filled? Did anyone get my chocolate cream filled? If you did, it's mine. 
CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA. 
ROGER I pointed at a chocolate cream filled. You saw me do it, didn't you? 
Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne. 
WAYNE You were there. Did you see him put it in a box? 
We PAN back to a CU of Roger. 
ROGER At the time, I was too busy explaining to Scott the finer points of film. 
We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT. 
SCOTT (O.S.) Yeah, right. You know what he said? He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is Spielberg's best film. 
Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too. 
WAYNE (to Roger) You can't be serious? 
ROGER (preoccupied) I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box. 
WAYNE Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey. 
ROGER That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake. 
WAYNE Roger, no. 
ROGER What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut--- 
WAYNE Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year. 
ROGER So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled? 
Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the windshield. 
WAYNE Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front. 
ROGER Wayne--- 
WAYNE Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear. 
The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY 
BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

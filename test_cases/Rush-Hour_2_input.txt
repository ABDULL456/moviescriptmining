He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red. 
MIRANDA (VO) (thru radio in his pocket) How's it going in there? 
CARSON (to himself) Nag, nag, nag... 
He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries again to lift her. This time it works!

INT./EXT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - INCLUDE APACHE HELICOPTER - DAY 
Time: 4:58. The Apache helicopter HOVERING outside is making an incredible racket. 
Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands, the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone head begin to PULL the gum away! 
Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm. 
Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero. 
WIDER 
The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa into the rescue harness. She's terrified. 
CARSON You'll be over in five seconds... 
She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so his sister can go. 
ANGLE ON BOMB 
One minute... fifty-nine seconds... 
CARSON 
sends Sam across... the harness comes back... he straps Mrs. Han into it... 
CARSON Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line. 
He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook. 
ANGLE ON BOMB 
Thirty seconds... twenty-nine... 
THE HARNESS 
slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and tries to undo the hook buckle with the other... 
But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing. 
Fifteen seconds to go... 
Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away. 
CARSON (shouts) Release the cable from your side! Get out of here! 
MIRANDA (shouts back) Come over the railing! Grab onto the harness!

MIRANDA Tear the hook loose!

MIRANDA Try it anyway!

Five seconds to go... 
The Apache helicopter backs away from the high-rise... 
The cable pulls taut... 
Carson wraps the webbing of the harness around his wrist... 
The Apache STRAINS against the resistance of the cable... 
The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson HANGING on the harness next to it... 
The helicopter turns and flies away... 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY 
The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower. 
All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.

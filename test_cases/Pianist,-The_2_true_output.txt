HENRYK You know what we do? We use psychology. 
SZPILMAN We use what? 
HENRYK We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this. (covers it with the newspaper) In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it. 
SZPILMAN Of course they'll notice it. But look-- (lifts the violin fingerboard.) This is a good place for something. 
HENRYK A good place for what? (to the others') He's insane! 
SZPILMAN Just shut up. 
FATHER (overlapping) My violin? 
They all talk at once. 
REGINA Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order! 
HALINA She's a lawyer, she likes order. 
REGINA Listen, just listen. Let's come to an agreement. We jam the money in the window frame. The watch we hide under the cupboard. And the chain we put in the violin. 
A brief silence. 
FATHER Will I still be able to play? 
SZPILMAN Let's find out. 
They start to hide the things. 
INT. WARSAW PHARMACY - DAY 
Szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone to answer his call. Then: 
SZPILMAN Jurek? Wladek Szpilman. 
JUREK (filtered) Wladek! How are you? 
SZPILMAN Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you? 
JUREK (filtered) Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station-- 
SZPILMAN (trying to interrupt) Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek... 
JUREK (filtered) ...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you. 
SZPILMAN Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career. 
EXT. WARSAW STREET AND CAFE PARADISO - DAY 
Szpilman and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with bombed-out buildings and rubble. She flicks admiring, almost loving glances at him as they walk and talk. And he is smiling, touched by her. 
DOROTA I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station. 
SZPILMAN You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful. 
DOROTA Really? 
SZPILMAN Yes! (he looks at her, smiles) It was...it was unforgettable. 
She's embarrassed. 
DOROTA I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman. 
SZPILMAN Wladek, please. 
DOROTA No one plays Chopin like you. 
She begins to laugh. 
SZPILMAN I could accompany you, me on the piano, you on the cello. 
They become almost helpless, holding on to each other. 
DOROTA Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.

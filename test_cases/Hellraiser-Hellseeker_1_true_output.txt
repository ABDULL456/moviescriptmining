flASH BACK: 
INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kirsty sits across from Lange, who slides the cube across the desk towards her. 
LANGE Open this and your problem will disappear forever. And no one will ever suspect you. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Kirsty drives. Trevor sits in the passenger seat, in the same position we saw him in during his last flashback. Only now it is clear the reason his head is resting on the baby blanket is to keep his brains from spilling out his split open skull. ON KIRSTY'S HAND holding his. It is now covered with blood. 
KIRSTY Shhh it's okay. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
The car goes off the bridge landing in the water. Kirsty's head breaks the surface. She watches the car sink into the river. 
baCK TO: 
INT. MORGUE 
Trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief. The sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs. Pinhead smiles. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) NOOO!! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The scream ECHOES over Trevor's dead self, which seems so tranquil in contrast. HOLD on the corpse. After a beat the bells stop, as does the rumbling and the cracking. The lights brighten. Serenity. Then: 
KIRSTY'S VOICE Yes. Yes that's him. 
REVERSE ANGLE on Kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her eyes. She looks over to the other side of the body where Trevor and Pinhead had been standing. Where now DETECTIVE LANGE and the coroner DR. AMBROSE had been standing. 
The two gentlemen look at each other. 
LANGE Well I guess that's it then. Thank you Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have been tough. 
Lange escorts Kirsty to the door. They EXIT but not before Kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance. Ambrose covers Trevor's body and looks OFF CAMERA. 
DR. AMBROSE Alrighty. Let's get started folks. 
REVERSE on two other DOCTORS who are busying themselves collecting instrument. ALLISON and SAGE. They walk over to Trevor's body and get to work. Sage sticks a needle in Trevor's arm. 
SAGE Collecting 40ccs of serum... 
AMBROSE Examining cranial fracture... 
Allison at his side, Ambrose checks the wound on Trevor's head, pauses to look inside Trevor's eyes. 
TREVOR'S POV: Ambrose closing the eyelid again. 
AMBROSE (CONT'D) Checking oral cavity for blockage... 
Ambrose opens Trevor's mouth. 
AMBROSE (CONT'D) And we have a winner... 
Ambrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of Trevor's mouth. Looks at the slippery creature for a moment. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ALLISON Looks like an eel of some kind. 
AMBROSE Guess it was murder after all. 
SAGE Yeah all we need is the eel's motive. 
Allison holds out a large freezer bag, into which Ambrose dumps the dead lamprey. 
ALLISON I still don't get it. He's been missing for almost eight months. But this body hasn't been dead more than twenty four hours.

NICOLE I won't lie. 
MITCHELL I don't want you to lie. 
NICOLE The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. 
MITCHELL There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this. 
NICOLE You seem very sure about that. 
MITCHELL I'm absolutely positive. 
NICOLE turns to face SAM.  She stares at him. 
NICOLE No matter what I'm asked, I'll tell the truth. 
SAM looks back, expressionless. 
MITCHELL That's fine.  I want you to be absolutely truthful.  And I'll be right there to advise and help you. And there'll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and 
that's what'll go to the judge, before the trial is set.  It'll be the same for everybody.  They'll be deposing the Ottos and the Walkers, the bus driver... 
NICOLE Dolores. 
MITCHELL Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last. 
NICOLE Why? 
MITCHELL So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that? 
NICOLE nods. 
SAM When do they award damages? 
MITCHELL Depends.  This could drag on for quite a while.  But we'll be there at the end, Sam.  Don't you worry. 
NICOLE (voice over) At that moment, I hated my parents - Daddy for what he knew and had done, 
NICOLE and even Mom for what she didn't know and hadn't done.  You told me it wasn't going to be easy.  But as I sat there, staring at Daddy, I knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my life.

REPLAY of the scene of SEAN WALKER entering the bus.  He turns around to face his mother. 
SEAN 
I want to stay with you. 
RISA Go on now.  Go on. 
SEAN hesitantly turns to face the inside of the bus.  He sees NICOLE BURNELL, who pats the seat beside her. 
MASON leaves his place beside NICOLE to make way for SEAN. 
NICOLE C'mon, Sean, sit next to me. 
ANGLE ON 
DOLORES as she watches SEAN move towards NICOLE. 
CUT TO 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY 
DOLORES gives her deposition.  A stenographer takes notes. MITCHELL listens, along with SCHWARTZ, the opposing lawyer. 
DOLORES He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened. 
MITCHELL Why would he be frightened?

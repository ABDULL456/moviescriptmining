SHERMIN (answering the accusation) Neither did I. 
Major Bell enters the helicopter. 
FOX We're going... Damn! (he shakes his head in disbelief) We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? 
MAJOR BELL Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? 
FOX (ignores this) Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground. 
SHERMIN We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here. 
FOX I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need. 
SHERMIN Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing? 
Fox sits silently for a second. 
FOX Contain it and get back to me. 
SHERMIN What do you mean by 'contain?' 
Fox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order. 
FOX Just what I said. 
The television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares at it blankly then Lyman turns it off. 
EXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING 
The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin into the Air Force helicopter. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him. 
When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on. 
Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car. 
VOICES It was great to have you back... The kids loved it. We loved it. You're doing the right thing... 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
JENNY I hope so... We'll see... See you tomorrow... Bye. Bye. 
VOICE (as the Volvo backs out of the driveway) Remember you're required to have a lesson planned tomorrow. 
Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into the house. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY 
The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire. 
Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the highway. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny push a hand mower over her back yard. 
He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his faceplate and speaks into it. 
STAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Suit and rockets destroyed. Radical mixture of this atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed chemo-ion response time to adapt my body to this air. Am going to attempt extreme transformation in order to cross land mass to site of our practice landings. If transformation is not fatal, second message ball by next darkness. 
He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it disappears. 
EXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON 
We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the tree tops rushing underneath. 
INT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON 
Shermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in front of the square of television screens watching various shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch his back. 
SHERMIN Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. 
LYMAN I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow. 
Pause. 
MAJOR BELL I'm telling you they're probably friendly. 
LYMAN Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say... 
RADAR TECHNICIAN (loud) UFO coming out of the grass. 
SHERMIN Lock in. 
RADAR TECHNICIAN Got it.

BASQUIAT Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. 
GEORGE Really? 
BASQUIAT Yeah. 
GEORGE Very well. 
He moves off towards the executives. George whispers to the HEAD EXECUTIVE, and nods towards Jean. The executives spread the words amongst themselves. They're horrified. 
BASQUIAT (continuing) Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were - 
GINA I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws. 
A YOUNG EXECUTIVE, obviously the loser, takes a deep breath and heads towards them. 
YOUNG EXECUTIVE 
Excuse me... On behalf of my friends I'd like to apologize. We're really sorry. 
BASQUIAT I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. 
The Executive reaches to shake Jean's hand. Jean puts a hundred dollar bill in his hand. 
YOUNG EXECUTIVE What's this for? 
BASQUIAT The tip. 
Jean turns back to Gina. The Executive leaves them. George smiles. 
GINA You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. 
BASQUIAT What's his name? 
Gina balks. Rather than face a disappointment - 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I have to go to the bathroom. 
INT. BARBETTA'S (BATHROOM) - DAY 
CLOSE ON JEAN - looking in the mirror. 
He looks at himself. 
He starts to pick at his face. 
INT. PALLADIUM - HUGE ROOM - NIGHT 
Jean and Albert Milo sit on a banquette 
A huge white painting of Jean's with a dragon's head hangs on one wall to their left. On the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black. 
Lots of PEOPLE mill about a huge room. 
A GIRL - another Gina look-alike walks through the crowd. Jean's eyes follow her momentarily.. 
BASQUIAT (re: the paintings) What do you think? 
ALBERT MILO 
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... (beat) I'd take some of them out. (beat) I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. 
BASQUIAT It's always how you would do it. This is my version. 
ALBERT MILO You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. 
BASQUIAT Why, so you could humiliate me? 
ALBERT MILO No, I wanted to make a painting of you. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE PARK - DAY 
Jean rides his bicycle through the park. He's looking up at the birds flying in the trees. 
ANGLE ON 
The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees. 
EXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY 
Jean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his shoulder. 
INT. THE FACTORY - DAY

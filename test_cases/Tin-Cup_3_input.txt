TIN CUP This is for Venturi, up there in the booth, thinking I should lay up... (addressing his ball) Dollar bills... 
He swings and holds the pose. He caught the ball perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing breeze, the GALLERY ROARS, and... 
... the ball drops, SPLOOSH! into the WATER, a couple feet short of dry land. The GALLERY GROANS.` 
BACK TO TIN CUP 
Staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't carry the water. 
TIN CUP That's a long fucking ways. (holds out his hand) Gimme another ball. 
ROMEO Roy... 
TIN CUP What? 
ROMEO It's a water hazard. You go up there and take a drop. Try to save par like you did yesterday. 
Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get through to him. 
TIN CUP You're right.    What the hell was I thinking? 
And he starts down to the water. A THUNDEROUS OVATION greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the fans saluting him. 
CUT TO: 
120   INT. PRESS TENT - AFTERNOON                                120 
Tin Cup snarls at the impudent question of Reporter #3. 
TIN CUP I saved par, didn't I? 
REPORTER #3 I'm just trying to understand your thinking. You were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you -- 
TIN CUP You don't think I can knock it on from there? 
REPORTER #3 It seemed like a low-percentage shot. 
TIN CUP So am I! Look at me. I'm playing for... (points at his sew-on patches) ... Rio Grande Short-Haul Trucking, Brink and Brown Sanitation, First State Bank of Salome, Wally's Smokehouse... You think a guy like me bothers to think about the percentages? -- 
CUT TO: 
121   EXT. WAFFLE HOUSE - NIGHT                                121 
A low-rent roadside cafe specializing in waffles. 
122   INT. WAFFLE HOUSE - NIGHT                                122 
Tin Cup, Molly and Romeo study the menu. 
MOLLY I've got some money from the pelican bet -- why don't we go somewhere fancy and celebrate -- get ready for the final round. 
TIN CUP Nothing to celebrate yet. Plus these are my people. I'm a waffle house guy -- gotta stay in touch with that... 
ROMEO Plus he needs his carbohydrates -- 
TIN CUP If the boys from Salome was in town -- this is where they'd be... 
The boys from Salome walk in -- with Doreen, all looking like hell from the long bus trip. They're ecstatic to see Tin Cup and Romeo. 
CLINT The legend! 
EARL God damn, we been driving for two days to help you in the last round -- 
JOSE Saw the Winnebago outside -- we're starving... 
DEWEY Sixty-two!    Sixty-two! 
TIN CUP We're home now! 
ROMEO You boys a sight for sore eyes. We so damn sick of guys in blazers and slacks that don't wrinkle. It ain't natural 'round here... 
DOREEN Congratulations, Roy -- we're with you all the way. 
TIN CUP Doreen, meet Dr. Griswold... er, Molly... my shrink -- 
MOLLY Ex-shrink. (matter-of-factly) We're sleeping together now so I can't be his therapist. 
DOREEN I knew it. 
MOLLY Knew what? 
DOREEN Nothing, dear. Good luck. (looking around) Say, I have a little extra cash -- why don't we go somewhere fancy and celebrate -- y'know, kinda get 
ready for the final round? 
But the Regulars overwhelm her. 
DEWEY This is the Waffle House, Doreen -- 
CURT Hell, I been dreaming of waffles for 1800 miles... 
EARL They got a waffle house in Odessa just about like this... 
JOSE Odessa?   It's in Midland, ain't it?... 
CLINT No, it's in Odessa. 
They all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening at the Waffle House.

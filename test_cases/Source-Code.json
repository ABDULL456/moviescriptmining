{"test1_input": "Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. Christina watches Colter go. Curious. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station. The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nA fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door. He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in stainless steel. He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on \nTHE MIRROR Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own. He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic. He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard. \nCOLTER Wake up! The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train, obliging him to hang on. This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from. The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he blinks. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nWarehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City. From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door. \nCUT TO: \nBATHROOM DOOR \nHer hand knocks. \nCHRISTINA Hey. You okay in there? \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nColter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end. \nINT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nChristina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks through the closed door. \nCHRISTINA You left your bag on the seat. Which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. I probably saved you a huge fine. No answer. \nCHRISTINA I'll just leave it right out here for you. She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the door. The oddness of this situation. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nColter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face. Practically catatonic at this point. And then her voice -- \nCHRISTINA (O.S.) If it'll help you remember, you've been riding this train every morning for three months. Her words rouse him. \nCOLTER \n(WHISPERS) Three months?! \nINT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nChristina's walking back down the aisle. The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a whoosh, and it's gone. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nOn the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink. Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand. What are they doing in the sink? He looks UP. An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE. Something is sitting up there. From outside comes a TRAIN HORN. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThrough the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \n", "test1_true": "A MASSIVE BOMB It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind wires and gaffing tape is CELL PHONE -- the bomb's detonator. \nCOLTER Jesus. \nRunning footsteps from outside. Commotion. An ALARM sounds. \nTHE BOMB'S CELL PHONE RINGS -- THE DEVICE'S CIRCUIT CLOSES -- \nTHE BOMB EXPLODES IN COLTER'S FACE WITH A HUGE AND DEAFENING \nFORCE, INSTANTLY KILLING HIM. \nINT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nTHE FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAR -- KILLING CHRISTINA AND \nALL THE OTHERS. \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING \nFuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks. Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of flames. On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in the intense heat. One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER -- ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated tracks... It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an traffic intersection below with a shattering force. The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy- gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore. And then... An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding down as we \nDISSOLVE TO: BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease. For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES appears. Like METAL RODS, maybe. RADIATING OUTWARDS. It makes no sense. An abstract pattern. Then it's gone. Many will not even see it. \nNow there is only darkness. Nothingness. Seconds pass. The CLICK of an INTERCOM switching on. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) This is Beleaguered Castle. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nWe're VERY CLOSE on Colter's UPSIDE DOWN face. His eyes flutter open. He's surprised to find himself alive. Consternation flashes through him as he discovers that he's tightly strapped in. He now wears a military flight suit. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. The measured calm of a mission controller's voice comes over Colter's headset. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain Stevens, do you copy? \nCOLTER Where am I? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) You're with Beleaguered Castle. PULL BACK, fractionally, to reveal Colter in a tight and confined CAPSULE. It bristles with sophisticated electronics and ghostly glowing diodes. He's like an astronaut in an orbiter craft. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Are you functional? He tries to clear his head. He's still upside down. \nCOLTER I'm dizzy. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Adjusting your rotation. Very slowly, almost imperceptibly, Colter's upside-down face begins to turn and right itself. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Can you report at this time? \nCOLTER What is this? Who am I talking to? More confusion. No idea how to react. Just as on the train. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Report what you saw. \nCOLTER When? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Just now. \nCOLTER I was on a train. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) And? \nCOLTER And... There was a bomb. \n", "test1_id": 1338, "test2_input": "COLTER If I told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that I was sent here to catch him, would you believe me? \nCHRISTINA Most fervently. \nCOLTER Then tell me which one you'd arrest. Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering different faces. \nCHRISTINA They're all so utterly normal. That's what's terrifying about them. Perhaps there's more than one. A team at work. The patent attorney in cahoots with Julius Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one. But they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker. She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker. \nCHRISTINA Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The perfect Machiavellian operative. Out for himself. He'll betray them all in the end. She's not taking him seriously. \nCOLTER Never mind. He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now reads THIRTEEN MINUTES. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train begins to slow. Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the College Kid head towards the exit doors. \nCHRISTINA \n(STAGE WHISPER) He's getting away...! Colter moves aside to let them walk past. \nCOLTER \n(CURT DISMISSAL) Thanks for your help, ma'am. \nCHRISTINA Ma'am? How old do you think I am? \nCOLTER I don't know. Thirty two? Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high. \nEXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING \nThe disembarking passengers exit the platform. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThe train is moving again. In the exit area, Colter watches the station disappear. He's doing this all wrong. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next stop New York Penn Station. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nThe two screws rattle in the sink. Colter gazes up at the half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the sinister bomb planted there. Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most baffling mystery of all. \nCOLTER What happened, Fentress? Who are you? How can I be you? FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit initials \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought. \nCOLTER \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d What unit is that? A KNOCK on the door. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThrough the windows comes the blur of the EXPRESS TRAIN whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over Colter). Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there. \nCHRISTINA Who were you talking to? \nCOLTER Leave me alone. Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows him, carrying his messenger bag. \nCHRISTINA My pleasure, okay? It's just that you left your bag on your seat. (trying to be cute) It's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. Maybe you're the terrorist. This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid. \nCOLTER Terrorist? Why did you say that? \nCHRISTINA I was joking. \nCOLTER Stop joking. Who are you? Are you an operative? \nCHRISTINA I had no idea you were so thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely sure I like it. \n", "test2_true": "CHRISTINA Part of what? \nCOLTER I can have you arrested. Maybe that's the only way you'll drop the bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm getting help. She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks in a flat, sober voice. \nCHRISTINA Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm twenty seven years old. I have no savings and no health insurance. He turns back. Waits. The more she speaks, the angrier she gets. \nCHRISTINA Six months ago I moved back in with my parents because I ran out of money. I got A's in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no one's buying my stuff. Two weeks ago I put away all my paints. My little sketch book is the last thing left. You see, I'm not a artist. I'm a receptionist in a law firm. The only thing I operate is a phone switchboard. \nThe stark reality of her life. The HORN of the FREIGHT TRAIN yanks his attention to the windows. Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the train exploded. Time is running down. \nCHRISTINA Now let me tell you about you. You work at the New York Public Library. You've been eyeing me for months on this train but haven't said a word to me. You're bland and colorless and predictable. And now I see you're delusional, too. Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window. \nCOLTER'S POV Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport. The view is wiped away as the FREIGHT TRAIN comes surging past the windows. But the sight of the plane has already caused something to click in Colter's head. \nCOLTER Son of a bitch. \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d That's not army. That's Air Force. Combined Air and Space Operations Center. Nellis Air Force Base! \nCHRISTINA Are you mocking me? \nCOLTER They're running this whole thing out of Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Fucking Nevada! Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this delusion after what she's confessed about herself. \nCOLTER (racking his brain) What's there? What's on that base? B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat Command. Predator Drones. Remote operations. (something to this) This a remote operation. \n(FINALLY) What if it is time travel? \nA worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his radio. We catch the words \"bomb threat.\"\u009d \nCOLTER What did he say? A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter. \nCHRISTINA Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to me again. She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away. Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY -- \nCOLTER Christina! He grabs her -- she struggles against him -- \nCHRISTINA Get off me! But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and squeezing his eyes shut as -- \nTHE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES. Blinding light. Painful to look at. Like a star exploding. A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss. And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view: A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it... A woman. It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring smile. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nClick -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's face in and out of darkness. \nThe capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non- functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry. Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the capsule's tomb-like cold. \nCOLTER Goodwin? What's happening? Come in. Can you read me? It's goddamn cold in here. He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which had been blowing in air FALL SILENT. \nCOLTER Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen. The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES. \nCOLTER Goodwin! It's now COMPLETELY DARK. He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump. A terrifying silence. The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing around. Then... The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule. Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS... But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed. He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is incredibly cramped. Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS. He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the hull. \nSo, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft. At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry. Daunted by the complexity. There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out of his hands. \nLATER Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed. Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing. \nCOLTER Come on! Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke. He's burned his fingers. But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT. Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint electric HUM. FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the craft. Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does, a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on: \nGOODWIN (V.O.) -- four principle dialects of Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian- Lebanese and North African. We will now play you portions of each, discussing the audible differences between them. CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play. Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE. With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to return. The icicles begin to DRIP. \nColter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work. The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB. Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various technicians wander by. \nCOLTER Hello? Anyone out there? It's me. He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up. Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of another world. It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as \nRUTLEDGE. \n", "test2_id": 1339, "test3_input": "RUTLEDGE (CONT'D) Derek Frost is a commodities trader, with a wife, two children and a promotion one month old. He's an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor, for God's sake. \nCOLTER You saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us. One of our own. \nRUTLEDGE If he's really the one, you can find out the rest of his plan. \nCOLTER How? \nRUTLEDGE By any means necessary. There is no Geneva Convention in the Source Code. \nCOLTER Torture him, you mean. \nRUTLEDGE \n(SHRUGS) Find out the plan, before it happens here. And then I'll let you die. Their grisly bargain. \nRUTLEDGE In the conductor's compartment there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun locked in a safe. Think you can remember the combination? \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nChristina is absorbed in her sketch book. Across from her, Colter watches. A stranger to her again. It hurts too much. She feels his eyes on her. When she looks up, he's gone. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nAs Guzman exits the bathroom, he almost crashes into Colter, who's waiting right there. \nGUZMAN Excuse me. \nCOLTER Assalam'alaikoom. Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the standard Arabic reply. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nReaching into the overhead crawl space, Colter once again unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb. Sitting down on the toilet seat, he dials 4-1-1 on the cell phone. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) What listing? \nCOLTER The New York Times. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nChristina's CELL PHONE RINGS. She gets it out. \nCHRISTINA Hello? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Christina? It's Stephanie. Where are you right now? \nCHRISTINA Going to work. Why? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) The strangest thing. The phone rang at my desk and some guy I don't know said the train you're on isn't safe and that you should get off at the next stop. Then he hung up. \nCHRISTINA What? The train begins to SLOW DOWN. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. \nCHRISTINA I don't understand. \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Maybe you should get off. Are you okay? The station platform slides into view. \nCHRISTINA I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is there something on the news? Some kind of alert? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Nothing that I've heard. \n", "test3_true": "The train pulls to a stop. Passengers begin to get off. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nChristina is out of her seat, debating. \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) I think you should get off. \nCHRISTINA I'll be late for work. \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) The hell with work, Christina! You hate that job anyway. \nCHRISTINA It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy from somewhere. She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes. And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly disappears into the other car. \nINT. SECOND CAR - MORNING \nThe doors stand open to the platform. Just then Derek's WALLET goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the wall panel. A second later, Colter reaches the exit area. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. \nEXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING \nThe train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform. Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward, Colter looks through the windows... And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A strange moment between the two of them. Once again he's failed to save her. They watch each other for as long as possible, until the train pulls away. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nAs the train SPEEDS UP, Christina sits down again, lowering her phone. \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Did you get off...? \nCHRISTINA No. I'll call you back. She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test. But what test? Why this weird feeling? \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) This is a New York bound train. Next stop New York - Penn Station. The train SPEEDS UP. Anxiety creeps into her face. Looking around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice. \nINT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING \nThe conductor enters. About to pour himself a cup of coffee \nWHEN -- \nCONDUCTOR Huh? The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED. \nINT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING \nInside the quiet lobby, Derek is heading for the outer doors to the parking lot, when: \nCOLTER (O.S.) Derek Frost. Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET. \nCOLTER You forget something? \nDEREK Gosh. Is that my wallet? As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM. \nINT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING \nBehind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of \nGUZMAN VOMITING. BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek inside. \nDEREK What the hell, man? What the hell??? \n", "test3_id": 1340}

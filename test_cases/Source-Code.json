{"train": "SOURCE CODE \nWritten by \nBen Ripley \nSOURCE CODE Darkness. A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS... \nINT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING \nCOLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face. He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented. Slowly he turns his head to one side... PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on their morning commute into a city. Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic strobe pattern. Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun. His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble. Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch. It reads 7:40 a.m. He swallows. A strange, creeping panic. He has no idea where he is. \nEXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING \nThe train hurls straight at us. NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it. Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER BAG. Is that his? Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather NAME TAG reads: \"SEAN FENTRESS.\"\u009d It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is starting to freak him out. He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE. CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of soda. Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button- down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and- bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal. \nCOLTER Ma'am? Nothing. \nCOLTER Excuse me... ma'am? She looks up. Blank stare. \nCOLTER What is this? \nCHRISTINA What's what? \nCOLTER Where am I? \nCHRISTINA (looks out the window) Almost at Newark. Goes back to her journal. \nCOLTER What's Newark? A city? \nCHRISTINA It's more of a hell hole. But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea slams into him. He hangs on to the seat. \nCOLTER Woah. \n(BEAT) I think I'm going to puke. \nCHRISTINA (gestures, alarmed) Okay, bathroom's that way. Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating. \nCHRISTINA Go. Seriously. Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length of the car until he finds the RESTROOM. The door is LOCKED. The latch reads \"OCCUPIED.\"\u009d Bracing himself, he lurches forward into... \nINT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING \nHe freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no, the passengers are different. Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom, he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors. \nCONDUCTOR Ticket? A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed. \nCONDUCTOR May I see your ticket? The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his pockets. \nCOLTER I don't think I... \nCONDUCTOR Have to write you up then. He pulls out a citation pad. \nCOLTER Is this...? From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The conductor snips his ticket and brushes past. \nCOLTER Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it here. Where's this train headed? \nCONDUCTOR New York. Penn Station. \nColter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. Christina watches Colter go. Curious. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station. The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nA fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door. He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in stainless steel. He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on \nTHE MIRROR Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own. He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic. He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard. \nCOLTER Wake up! The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train, obliging him to hang on. This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from. The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he blinks. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nWarehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City. From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door. \nCUT TO: \nBATHROOM DOOR \nHer hand knocks. \nCHRISTINA Hey. You okay in there? \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nColter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end. \nINT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nChristina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks through the closed door. \nCHRISTINA You left your bag on the seat. Which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. I probably saved you a huge fine. No answer. \nCHRISTINA I'll just leave it right out here for you. She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the door. The oddness of this situation. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nColter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face. Practically catatonic at this point. And then her voice -- \nCHRISTINA (O.S.) If it'll help you remember, you've been riding this train every morning for three months. Her words rouse him. \nCOLTER \n(WHISPERS) Three months?! \nINT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS \nChristina's walking back down the aisle. The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a whoosh, and it's gone. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nOn the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink. Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand. What are they doing in the sink? He looks UP. An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE. Something is sitting up there. From outside comes a TRAIN HORN. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThrough the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \n(PANICKING) What the hell is going on?! \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Just relax, Captain. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nLater. We're still in the tiny chamber. It's stabilized. As has Colter, but in the manner of a dangerous wild animal given a sedative. Embedded into the controls is a two inch-square VIDEO MONITOR. It shows the face of GOODWIN. He's a middle-aged communications officer. Although we know him as Goodwin, his military name badge and rank insignia have been covered up. He wears a headset and sits surrounded by banks of electronic equipment and keyboards. He peers in at Colter, exuding the blandness of a military flight controller. \nGOODWIN Standby for thread one of alpha memory pattern. \nCOLTER Who are you? \nGOODWIN You already have that information, Captain. Now think. Recall my name. A long moment. A name floats into his head. \nCOLTER Goodwin? \nGOODWIN Correct. \nCOLTER How do I know that? I have no idea how I know your name's Goodwin. \nGOODWIN Commencing memory pattern. \nCOLTER Listen to me. Something's wrong. I was flying a mission. I was in a chopper. Then I woke up on a train. Now I'm here. Can you explain that? What unit is this? \nGOODWIN You're with Beleaguered Castle. \nCOLTER Who? \nGOODWIN You're with friends. \n(PATIENTLY) The exercises will assist you. Are you ready? Just like with the train, he seems to have no choice but to go along with it. \nGOODWIN Memory Thread One. Listen to the following passage: \"When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver. \n(MORE) \nGOODWIN (CONT'D) In the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building, she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a chair.\"\u009d End of thread one. Silence. Is it Colter's turn to speak? \nCOLTER I don't get it. Is this a Red Flag exercise? \nGOODWIN Thread Two. Listen. I am holding the following hand of cards: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. \n(BEAT) I repeat: Queen of spades. Four of clubs. Nine of clubs. Three of hearts. Nine of hearts. End of thread two. Beads of sweat on Colter's forehead. What the hell? \nGOODWIN Thread Three. The following is a recording of a Western Screech-Owl: A rather spooky BIRD CALL plays -- a short whistle, followed by a long trill. The call is repeated twice more. \nGOODWIN End of Thread Three. End of pattern. Acknowledge. Unexpectedly, in the back of his mind, a reply is there. \nCOLTER A... Acknowledge. End of pattern. How did he know to say that? A conditioned response? \nGOODWIN Stand by to initiate pattern recall. \nCOLTER Go for pattern recall. The response comes to him more quickly. Like lines from an old script. Even if it still baffles him. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) The five playing cards. Arrange them in order of descending values, irrespective of suit. He thinks for a moment. Focus. Play along. Maybe it will all be okay. \nCOLTER Queen, two nines, four and a three. \nGOODWIN That is correct. The passage I read contained mention of a woman's name. What was that name? \nBREATHING. \nCOLTER (V.O.) Hey. What's happening? The HUM of machinery starting up. \nCOLTER (V.O.) Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all this? The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a GENTLE ROCKING SENSATION. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter opens his eyes... SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to \nLOOK OUT \nA TRAIN WINDOW At the passing woodland scenery. He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat. Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad. Just like before. Other commuters all around him. Everything is exactly the same as before. Note: The remaining story will follow this \"binary pattern.\"\u009d Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule. Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from, the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers, the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the window, bursting with summer leaves. Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40 a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in the canvas messenger bag beside him... This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger bag. The books are stamped \"NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY.\"\u009d He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious. \nIs Goodwin watching him from somewhere? Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites. Enjoying this small pleasure. He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his \nTRAIN TICKET. CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet. CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man opens his can of soda. Just as before. \nCOLTER It's a goddamn simulation. Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up. \nCOLTER A three dimensional, completely immersive scenario. Touch, taste, sound, sight and smell. A measure of relief. A way to think about all this. \nCHRISTINA Are you talking to me? \nCOLTER Complete with pretty girl. \nCHRISTINA Pretty girl. \nCOLTER Every combat simulator has one. In the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno. \n(CONFIDENT NOW) You're an unusual choice for a distraction. \nCHRISTINA And you're a moron. Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts walking up the rows. \nCOLTER Find the bomber. Find the bomber. The conductor approaches him. \nCONDUCTOR Ticket? Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be punched. \nCOLTER Everything okay today, chief? \nCONDUCTOR Say what? \nCOLTER Anything out of the ordinary? The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy? \nCONDUCTOR Please take a seat, sir. Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on. All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts. Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter. Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: The STITCHING on a leather purse. A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray. AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent. A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda can. TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on the floor. Faster and faster. Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone: \nDEREK Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... Then... the CLICK of a LOCK UNLATCHING. \nThe restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly takes a seat. Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom. The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom. Colter starts down the long aisle. In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin. \nCOLTER How's it going? Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable. \nCOLTER What's your name? Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The conductor appears, accosting Colter. \nCONDUCTOR Didn't I tell you to take a seat? \nCOLTER Goodwin? Where are you? It's over. I found him. Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing happens. \nCONDUCTOR Who are you talking to? An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops. It's too easy. Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just might be a mistake. He reconsiders. \nCOLTER Sorry. This guy seemed a little... anxious. I was worried about him. \nGOODWIN With Beleaguered Castle. \nCOLTER My unit's still in Iraq. I'm flying missions in Iraq. I flew one yesterday! \nGOODWIN Your unit was rotated Stateside three weeks ago. The news comes like a slap in the face. Colter clearly has no memory of this. \nCOLTER Then why do I still have Iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails? Goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls. \nCOLTER Talk to me! Three weeks? I've been back three weeks? How'd I get in here? Have I seen my family? Does my father know I'm home? \"\u0098Cause I'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case. \nGOODWIN Listen up, soldier. Goodwin hunches forward, putting his elbows on his desk. As he does so, he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his military unit SHOULDER PATCH. The insignia contains wings and a lightning bolt against a background of stars. Underneath it is written \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d \nGOODWIN The train is just the beginning. Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today. And they're linked with the train. Time is of the essence. Do you understand? Colter barely hears. He's fixated on that shoulder patch. \nGOODWIN Captain? \nCOLTER I'm listening. \nGOODWIN D.N.I. Counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the New York area. \n(MORE) \nGOODWIN (CONT'D) They are, in no order of importance, the Holland Tunnel, Newark International Airport, the Brooklyn Bridge, Penn Station and the Empire State Building. It could be any of them, it could be none of them. Whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent. Those are your orders. It's too much information to process. Colter's head spins with questions. \nCOLTER Wait. If I'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't I just dismantle the bomb? \nGOODWIN Those are not your orders. \nCOLTER But all those people dying... \nGOODWIN Those are not your orders. You are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission. Military priorities. Defying comprehension. \nCOLTER I didn't volunteer for this shit. \nGOODWIN Would you like to see the release form you signed? \nCOLTER \n(EXASPERATED) How do I know it's real? How do I know you didn't force me to sign it? And how the hell can I be put on a train over and over again -- a train I never was really on?! He might as well be talking to a wall. \nCOLTER I don't believe in time travel, Goodwin. There's no such thing. \nMachinery begins to RUN. Like the WHINE of a JET ENGINE firing up. \nGOODWIN Only one way forward, Captain. Seventeen minutes. Find the truth. \nCOLTER Why seventeen? Why me? Why anything? The capsule begins to SHAKE. \nCOLTER Let me out! Don't send me back there! SFX: UP ON a HUGE ROAR as -- \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING \nTHE TRAIN hurls down the tracks. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nLandscape flies by. Colter's forehead rests against the glass window. Piercing sunlight. \nCOLTER Shit. This is not happening. He leans back in his seat, as if just another beaten down office worker on the train. \nCHRISTINA Ain't life grand? Across from him, Christina sketching. A gentle smirk. He focuses in on her. Not knowing where else to begin. \nCOLTER If I told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that I was sent here to catch him, would you believe me? \nCHRISTINA Most fervently. \nCOLTER Then tell me which one you'd arrest. Christina pages through her sketch pad again. Considering different faces. \nCHRISTINA They're all so utterly normal. That's what's terrifying about them. Perhaps there's more than one. A team at work. The patent attorney in cahoots with Julius Caesar and the nebbishy guy. And don't forget the sullen college kid. He's the expendable one. But they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker. She shows him her sketch of Derek, the Stock Broker. \nCHRISTINA Blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. The perfect Machiavellian operative. Out for himself. He'll betray them all in the end. She's not taking him seriously. \nCOLTER Never mind. He gets up. Foolish of him to confide in her. His watch now reads THIRTEEN MINUTES. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train begins to slow. Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the College Kid head towards the exit doors. \nCHRISTINA \n(STAGE WHISPER) He's getting away...! Colter moves aside to let them walk past. \nCOLTER \n(CURT DISMISSAL) Thanks for your help, ma'am. \nCHRISTINA Ma'am? How old do you think I am? \nCOLTER I don't know. Thirty two? Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high. \nEXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING \nThe disembarking passengers exit the platform. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThe train is moving again. In the exit area, Colter watches the station disappear. He's doing this all wrong. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next stop New York Penn Station. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nThe two screws rattle in the sink. Colter gazes up at the half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the sinister bomb planted there. Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most baffling mystery of all. \nCOLTER What happened, Fentress? Who are you? How can I be you? FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit initials \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought. \nCOLTER \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d What unit is that? A KNOCK on the door. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThrough the windows comes the blur of the EXPRESS TRAIN whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over Colter). Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there. \nCHRISTINA Who were you talking to? \nCOLTER Leave me alone. Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows him, carrying his messenger bag. \nCHRISTINA My pleasure, okay? It's just that you left your bag on your seat. (trying to be cute) It's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. Maybe you're the terrorist. This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid. \nCOLTER Terrorist? Why did you say that? \nCHRISTINA I was joking. \nCOLTER Stop joking. Who are you? Are you an operative? \nCHRISTINA I had no idea you were so thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely sure I like it. \nCOLTER Can you hear me? Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset. \nRUTLEDGE Project designer initiating sequence and drives check. \nCOLTER I'm here! I'm okay! Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right. \nRUTLEDGE Is someone there? \nCOLTER Yeah. It's me. Colter. Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling. \nRUTLEDGE Wow! It's you. \nCOLTER The capsule lost power. It's still pretty cold in here. \nRUTLEDGE We've been working towards you from the other side. Nice to have you with us again. You feeling all right? \nCOLTER I think so. Who are you? \nRUTLEDGE The name's Rutledge. \nCOLTER They wouldn't let me talk to you before. \nRUTLEDGE No, I guess not. They're pretty anal around here. (lights his pipe) Don't tell them you saw me smoking in here, okay? His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the military environment. And then it occurs to Colter: \nCOLTER You're the inventor of this thing. \nRUTLEDGE \n(SHRUGS) I prefer the term project designer. And sorry for all the secrecy. Goodwin will be thrilled you re- established contact. \nCOLTER I don't want to deal with Goodwin anymore. \nRUTLEDGE What? \nCOLTER Don't you understand? He's torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't you get me out of here? Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to deal with personnel issues. \nRUTLEDGE Why would Goodwin have it in for you? \nCOLTER He's a remote operator. And remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field. \nRUTLEDGE He seems pretty devoted to the mission. \nCOLTER And just what kind of mission is this? Talk to me, man. Why won't he let me save those people on the train? \nRUTLEDGE Because they can't be saved. \nCOLTER Why not? I know what's going to happen. I could take apart the bomb. Stop the train. \nRUTLEDGE Yeah but you'd be doing it in the Source Code, not here. Not in our own past. Mystery upon mystery. \nCOLTER What's the difference? \nRUTLEDGE I'm not sure I should be telling you this. \nCOLTER Telling me what? Coaxing the scientist in him. \nRUTLEDGE It's quantum physics. Linear algebra. Parabolic calculus. It would take weeks to explain. \nCOLTER Is Source Code time travel? \nRutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe. \n(THINKING) So... so who benefits from that? What's vulnerable? What's down there in lower Manhattan? \n(BEAT) Wall Street. \nSurprising himself with this insight. And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more. \nCOLTER Wall Street. That's what they're going to hit next. The financial markets. Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly impressed. \nGOODWIN I want to show you something. \nCUT TO: \nDRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry, secretive smile. \nCOLTER Did she die, too? \nGOODWIN Yes. This drivers license photo was found with her body. We're creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site. A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts. \nCOLTER You sure she's dead? \nGOODWIN Would you like to see her morgue photos? \nCOLTER \n(QUIETLY) She was sitting across from me. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) We know. \nCUT TO: \nTHE VIDEO MONITOR \nPlaying a GRAINY, HAND-HELD VIDEO of the TRAIN WRECKAGE. Rescue workers in protective gear picking their way carefully through the twisted, charred remains of the two trains. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) This was taken shortly after the rescue crews arrived on scene. The TIME CODE on the image reads 8:26 a.m. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) We noted the location of each corpse when we pulled it out. On screen, rescue workers pull a CHARRED CORPSE out of the wreckage. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Prepare yourself. This is unedited footage. \nCOLTER I told you I didn't want to see her! The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else. \nCOLTER That's... \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Sean Fentress. The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train. \nCOLTER He died on the train. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) As a host identity, Sean Fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you. Gender. Blood type. Approximate age. His head was still intact. We need the head, you see. To link the two of you remotely. They carry the corpse towards a MORGUE TRUCK with a vast array of SATELLITE COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT attached to it. \nThe image freezes, then DISSOLVES back to Christina's DMV photo. Silence. Pondering. \nGOODWIN Would you like to see the other passenger photos? Perhaps that would help you. \nCOLTER You still have Christina's body? The other things she was carrying? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Why? \nCOLTER I want to know about her. Everything I can. She's not just another victim. She's connected to all this. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nCOLTER The thing is, that's not me. \nCHRISTINA Give me a little credit. \nCOLTER No. You drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else. I'm not Sean Fentress. I'm not really on this train. \nCHRISTINA \n(INCOMPREHENSION) You're not really on this train. \nCOLTER I'm taking someone's place. Borrowing it. My name is Colter. I'm a soldier. And I'm being held prisoner. And this is the only way -- the only time and place I have -- to figure out how to escape. She gives him a blank look. \nCHRISTINA After three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me? \nCOLTER I'm serious. Elements in the American military are using me for an experiment. I'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but I'm at a facility on Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Right now. As we speak. It's a project called Source Code. \nCHRISTINA Source Code. \nCOLTER It's a program. It shifts identities. It also performs small amounts of time travel. Or \"time engineering.\"\u009d I don't know the jargon. He's not getting through to her. It's too bizarre. \nCOLTER I've been put on this train to look for someone. A criminal. And I need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train. Because right here's only place I can figure out what's really happening. But I have very little time. And each time I come back, you won't remember me and I'll have to go through this all over again. \nCHRISTINA You are, I think, deliciously mad. \nCOLTER Then how do I know all those things about you if we've never spoken before? She doesn't have an answer. Can't easily dismiss him. \nCHRISTINA Why tell all this to me? There's lots of people around for you to talk to. \nCOLTER Because I think you have the answer to this whole thing. \nCHRISTINA Believe me, I don't have the answer for anything. \nCOLTER There's a vision. I keep having it. It's very powerful. And you're in it. And there's a bicycle. And this... old stone wall. And it's very peaceful. Does this sound familiar? Like where you live, maybe? \nCHRISTINA Stone walls? My parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an American eagle over the door. The only bike is a Harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning. \nCOLTER The vision must mean something. It's the only time when I'm not on the train or in the capsule. Why else would Rutledge be so interested? \nCHRISTINA Who's Rutledge? \nCOLTER Someone who was trying to help me understand something. Until they got to him. He lowers his head. A dead end. No answer. The train begins to slow down. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. Colter looks at HIS WATCH. Ten minutes left. \nCHRISTINA I saw a program on TV. It was about psychics. They say psychics have a lot of paranoia. \nCOLTER I don't believe in that shit. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. Through the window, the Old Man, Derek and the College Kid disembark. Guzman hurries past them to the station house. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. \nCHRISTINA Don't you have people you can go to for help? Friends, family? The train begins to move again. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) This is a New York bound train. Next stop, New York - Penn Station. \nCOLTER Most of my friends are in the military. My dad runs a melon farm in Alabama. \nCHRISTINA Maybe now's the time to reach out to him. She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his hand. \nCOLTER Me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye. We're just two different people. \n(LAUGHS) Ma'am? How old do you think I am? He gives her a wary look. Considers. \nCOLTER Twenty five? She smiles, pleased. \nCHRISTINA No, but thanks. \n(BEAT) What did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? How do you know that? Colter looks away. Careful. \nCOLTER I just do. \nCHRISTINA How can I help you if you don't tell me everything about this? \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nColter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to follow him into the bathroom. \nCOLTER You said you wanted to know. \nCHRISTINA Can't you just tell me? He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in next to him. \nCHRISTINA Try anything and I'll kill you. \nCOLTER Shut the door. As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink. \nCHRISTINA What are you doing? He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside. \nCOLTER It's up here. He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way. \nCHRISTINA (startled, feels his hands \nON HER) What are you -- \nCOLTER Just look. Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb. \nCHRISTINA Is that...? \nCOLTER Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid explosive. There's fourteen cannisters of it. Simple detonator. Cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom. He lowers her. An incredulous beat. \nCHRISTINA Did you put this here? \nCOLTER No. It was someone else. They don't know who. That's why I'm here. To find out. Watching her. Will she believe him? \nCHRISTINA We have to tell someone. We have to stop this. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThe bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away. Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her. \nCOLTER It won't matter. The train's already... \nCHRISTINA Already what? \nCOLTER I've been sent here. It sounds crazy, but it's true. I've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. This train's already been blown up. She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be. \nCOLTER You wanted to know. Now you know. She turns and hurries for the exit doors. \nCHRISTINA This isn't happening. I've got to get off. Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's stabbing at the door release button. \nCHRISTINA Why won't it open?! Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the number. \nCHRISTINA It's Steph. \nPOST OPERATOR (V.O.) Yes, sir. How may I direct your call? He takes a deep breath. \nCOLTER I'm trying to reach... Captain Colter Stevens. Calling himself. Strange. No idea where this is going. \nPOST OPERATOR (V.O.) I have no listing for a Captain Colter Stevens. \nCOLTER Then give me the Combined Air and Space Ops Center. \nPOST OPERATOR (V.O.) One moment, sir. The call seems to take forever to connect. Then a terse military VOICE comes on the phone. \nVOICE (V.O.) C Deck. \nCOLTER Who is this? \nVOICE (V.O.) C Deck. \nCOLTER I'm calling for Rutledge. It's urgent. \nVOICE (V.O.) You have the wrong number. \nCOLTER This is Captain Colter Stevens. An eerie pause. \nVOICE (V.O.) Would you repeat that? \nCOLTER Colter Stevens. Captain Colter Stevens. \nVOICE (V.O.) Hold the line. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The train slows at it pulls into Newark Station. Another voice comes over the phone. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain? This is Goodwin. Colter's heart sinks. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Where are you, Captain? \nCOLTER Let me talk to Rutledge. \nGOODWIN Where are you? How did you find us? \nCOLTER I'm on the train. The train pulls to a stop. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) What train? \nCOLTER \n(REALIZES) You don't know. It hasn't happened yet. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) What hasn't happened? \nCOLTER The explosion. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) What explosion? \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All aboard. Doors are closing. \nCOLTER Don't you understand? I'm in it, Goodwin. I'm calling you from inside the mission. Inside the Source Code. A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next stop New York Penn Station. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) This contact is ill-advised. I must ask you to hang up. \nCOLTER How can I get out of this? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) You must realizes the army's made an investment in you. You'll be used again. \nCOLTER How? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Imagine a turntable. With a record spinning on it. All we do is lift up the needle. The music stops. \nCOLTER And then what? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Then we wait. Until another mission. And the needle comes down again. You won't remember any of this. We'll start with the playing cards. Electronic tones. Simple memory exercises. Bit by bit, we'll revive your cerebral capacities once more. The barbarism of it. Digital slavery. \nCOLTER How many times have I done this? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Does it matter? \nCOLTER No one knows I'm here. No one can help me. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) In stimulating your cortex, they're prolonging your life. Many soldiers would find that preferable to death. \nCOLTER You can't do this. I served my country. I already gave my life. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) The courts. \nCOLTER What? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) The courts know you're here. \nCOLTER Military court or civilian court? \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Military. Colter finds no comfort in this. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) I'm sorry you found out about all of this. That wasn't our intention. \nCOLTER Does that make it any less wrong? No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCOLTER'S FACE Ashen. Almost lifeless. Around him is the darkened steel cocoon of the \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nIts appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new awareness of what this really is. The capsule is even more claustrophobic. There are fewer controls. Even less light. A shadow world. The monitor is blank. He shouts from the void -- \nCOLTER Goodwin?! Rutledge appears. Drops into the seat and puts on the headset. Fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at the camera. \nRUTLEDGE How's it going? Any breakthroughs? \nCOLTER I finally get it, Rutledge. You're the good guy, Goodwin's the bad guy. Working together, you get what you want out of me. Why didn't I see it before? \nRUTLEDGE Believe me, Captain, I'm on your side. \nCOLTER Drop it. I know about the helicopter crash. I know what they've done with me. \nRUTLEDGE \n(STRUGGLING) Look, it's been a long day. For all of us. But now we've got to bring this home and catch a killer. \nCOLTER What's in it for me? \nRUTLEDGE Come on. These guys are serious. Help me out. My ass is on the line, too, you know. \nCOLTER I was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator -- which I was instructed not to do. His delivery is different now. Impersonal. Distant. \nRUTLEDGE Did you make any other progress? What in heck's name did you do for those seventeen minutes? Colter does not answer. The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered. Eyes dart accusingly to the screen. \nCOLTER Wait. What are you -- \nTHUNK. Again, he convulses and goes limp. Click. Darkness. Everything POWERS DOWN... ... And BACK UP again -- controls, monitor, machinery. Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror. Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him with impatience. \nRUTLEDGE We can do this all day. Until you get it right. \nCOLTER Please... I don't feel good... \nRUTLEDGE I don't doubt it. Who's the bomber? \nCOLTER I don't know... I honestly... I can't keep... The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin. Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out against the controls. He SCREAMS... \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \n... and, in sudden freedom, surges up out of his seat with a cry. Around him startled passengers look over in confusion. \nCHRISTINA Hey! \nColter, back in his navy jacket, slacks and shirt, has pitched forward into Christina. \nCHRISTINA You want to get off me? The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger poised to open his can of soda. \nCOLTER Go ahead! Open your fucking soda! CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing. \nCHRISTINA What's wrong with you, anyway? She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond. Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle. But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape. Imprisoned in both worlds. From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment in him. \nEXIT AREA Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him on the shoulder. \nCHRISTINA You okay? He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen another human being before. \nCHRISTINA You're not okay. He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely. \nCOLTER Ma'am, please... return to your seat. Footsteps. The sound of jangling KEYS. \nCONDUCTOR Ticket. \nThe conductor takes up position in front of him. As implacable as Rutledge, in his way. \nCONDUCTOR Ticket, please. \nCHRISTINA He's not feeling well. \nCONDUCTOR He still needs a ticket. Colter makes no move to respond. No more concern for anything. \nCONDUCTOR Have it your way, pal. He takes out his book to write Colter up. \nCHRISTINA Wait. I'll pay it. \nCONDUCTOR I have no idea where he got on. Full fare's $22.50. \nCHRISTINA All right, all right. Getting out her wallet, she pays the conductor. He eyes her with disapproval, then shambles off. \nCHRISTINA I see customer service is alive and well on New Jersey Transit. \nCOLTER Why did you just do that? \nCHRISTINA The ticket? I don't know. You looked a little lost. The gratitude in his look makes her self conscious. She turns to go. \nRUTLEDGE (CONT'D) Derek Frost is a commodities trader, with a wife, two children and a promotion one month old. He's an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor, for God's sake. \nCOLTER You saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us. One of our own. \nRUTLEDGE If he's really the one, you can find out the rest of his plan. \nCOLTER How? \nRUTLEDGE By any means necessary. There is no Geneva Convention in the Source Code. \nCOLTER Torture him, you mean. \nRUTLEDGE \n(SHRUGS) Find out the plan, before it happens here. And then I'll let you die. Their grisly bargain. \nRUTLEDGE In the conductor's compartment there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun locked in a safe. Think you can remember the combination? \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nChristina is absorbed in her sketch book. Across from her, Colter watches. A stranger to her again. It hurts too much. She feels his eyes on her. When she looks up, he's gone. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nAs Guzman exits the bathroom, he almost crashes into Colter, who's waiting right there. \nGUZMAN Excuse me. \nCOLTER Assalam'alaikoom. Squeezing past, Guzman does a double take to hear the standard Arabic reply. \nINT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING \nReaching into the overhead crawl space, Colter once again unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb. Sitting down on the toilet seat, he dials 4-1-1 on the cell phone. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) What listing? \nCOLTER The New York Times. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nChristina's CELL PHONE RINGS. She gets it out. \nCHRISTINA Hello? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Christina? It's Stephanie. Where are you right now? \nCHRISTINA Going to work. Why? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) The strangest thing. The phone rang at my desk and some guy I don't know said the train you're on isn't safe and that you should get off at the next stop. Then he hung up. \nCHRISTINA What? The train begins to SLOW DOWN. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. \nCHRISTINA I don't understand. \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Maybe you should get off. Are you okay? The station platform slides into view. \nCHRISTINA I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is there something on the news? Some kind of alert? \nSTEPHANIE (V.O.) Nothing that I've heard. \nCOLTER You see this? Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face. \nCOLTER Now you can't blow it up. \nDEREK What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him. \nCOLTER Believe me, I'm very accurate with one of these things. \nDEREK Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a decent man, terrorized. It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy? A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him. \nCOLTER Stay there, my man. \nDEREK Don't hurt me. \nCOLTER Stop acting, for Chrissakes. \nDEREK Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble. \nGUZMAN There. Now you have two wallets. Take them and go. \nCOLTER Shut up! Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this. \nDEREK Please. I have a family. \nCOLTER What about those other passengers? Don't you think they had families? \nGUZMAN Just what is this about? \nCOLTER This man's a terrorist. He planted a bomb on the train. \nDEREK \n(HALF LAUGHS) What? Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek. \nCOLTER What's the next attack? Who else are you going to kill today, huh? \nDEREK \n(IN TEARS) Oh God... Oh God... Guzman takes a step towards Colter. \nCOLTER One more step, asshole. \nGUZMAN Don't treat him like this. He's not an animal. Neither are you. \nDEREK Listen to him. For God's sake I'm not a terrorist...! A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down, ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him. \nCOLTER Piss all you want. You took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today. \nDEREK Eighty million dollars? I swear to you... \nCOLTER Then what about the wallet, huh? Why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board? \nDEREK \nI... I... \nCOLTER Time's up! What is it?! What is the next attack! So help me, I'll put this bullet through your brain. \nDEREK I don't know what you're talking about! \nCOLTER I'm going to do it. Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk. \nDEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST. Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and -- \nBLAM! \nSHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD. Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A terrible silence. \nCHRISTINA (V.O.) What's happening? Are you okay? Are you there? Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly walks out. As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on his beeping WATCH -- Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world \nBLEACHES WHITE... In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in: THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL. CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT. We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She continues towards the light... and we do not follow. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nThe monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his seat. For long seconds we watch his face. \nINT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nA jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V. and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid mysterious scientific equipment. \nRutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving his country. \nRUTLEDGE \n(INTO PHONE) Yes... We appreciate that... I just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges... Thank you, sir. When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him. \nRUTLEDGE Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence. And that virtually assures all of our futures. This is just the beginning, guys. \n(TO GOODWIN) You did a great job, Goodwin. You operated our captain with skill and professionalism. What's that you have? Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION. \nGOODWIN The Army investigated Colter's helicopter crash in Iraq. Apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel. \nRUTLEDGE What's this, then? Some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying? \nGOODWIN No. It's the Silver Star. Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's breezy good humor. \nRUTLEDGE Send it on to his father. It'll ease the pain of his son's death. \nGOODWIN I thought I might inform the captain of the citation. \nRUTLEDGE Better not. We can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean. \nGOODWIN The memory wipe? \nTECHNICIAN I thought we were going to let him die. \nRUTLEDGE I know, I know. But now the Director of National Intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep Colter around to demonstrate it. \nTECHNICIAN Oh. \nRUTLEDGE This thing is much bigger than any one of us. Goodwin, please clear Colter's memories and re-initialize Source Code. Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the envelope. \nINT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY \nMission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up and goes to flip a switch. Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the envelope with the citation in it. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nInside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to himself. The MONITOR then comes on. \nGOODWIN Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle. Acknowledge transmission. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nDEREK Of course. What's this about? Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE and is DIALING IT as he turns around. The police approach, cautiously. \nPOLICE COMMANDER Place your hands in the air. \nDEREK My pleasure. Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone. On board the train there's a RINGING. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nThe DETONATOR PHONE has been removed from the bomb and now rings harmlessly in the hand of the train's SECURITY OFFICER. The restroom door is open and swarming with conductors examining the bomb. On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him. Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Once again, please return to your seats, ladies and gentlemen. No way. No one's moving from the windows. Except for Colter, who stands off by himself. The first look of satisfaction we've ever seen on his face. \nINT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nAn ALARM is going off. At a locked door, an Air Force LOCKSMITH is in the process of disabling the key pad. Rutledge paces, livid. \nRUTLEDGE I want to know who reprogrammed this lock. And if you don't get this open in ten seconds I'll see that you're busted back down to private. \nLOCKSMITH I'm already a private, sir. \nRUTLEDGE Just open it! A man's life is at stake. The key pad goes GREEN and the pressure lock releases. Rutledge tears open the door. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nArmed MILITARY POLICE clatter down the steps. \nINT. BUNKER MEDICAL FACILITY - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nGoodwin enters. He locks another door behind him. He is shaken but nevertheless going forward. In the chamber, three MEDICS monitor gauges and screens. One of them stands up to block his way. \nMEDIC #1 Sorry, I can't let you pass. Goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the insignia of a major. \nGOODWIN Step aside. That's an order. \nMEDIC #1 We all know your rank, Goodwin, but I have explicit orders from Rutledge not to -- BAM! Goodwin drops the Medic with a splintering HEADBUTT. \nGOODWIN I'm glad you know my rank. Were you also aware I'm in the Special Forces? \nEXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING \nThe train has been evacuated as police investigators search the rest of the cars. Hoards of passengers fill the platform as conductors try to herd them towards the station. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, rail service has been cancelled. Please clear the platform and proceed into the station. New Jersey Transit apologizes for the inconvenience. \nEXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING \nPolice cars parked everywhere. Two DETECTIVES are questioning the Computer Engineer. \nDETECTIVE So you have no idea how your cell phone was used to call in the tip? \nCOMPUTER ENGINEER No! People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee. \nCHRISTINA What now? How do we get to work? You guys have some busses or something? The transit employee ignores her and walks away. \nCHRISTINA Hey! I'm talking to you! She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench. \nCOLTER Ain't life grand? Looking over, she notices him. \nCHRISTINA Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for being late. \nCOLTER Maybe that's a good thing. She gives him a sharp look. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING \nGuzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him. \nGUZMAN I resent this. This is harassment. You obviously work for someone. \nFBI. CIA. \n(BITTER) I expected this reception in your country. \nCOLTER How are you going to pull this off? That bomb has a cell phone detonator. And I don't see a pay phone around here. So I'm betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in. \nGUZMAN I have no idea what you're talking about. I am an international business man. An executive. The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching. \nCOLTER Open your briefcase. Prove to me there's no phone in there. \nGUZMAN \n(STANDS UP) I will prove nothing to you. Leave me alone. WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending Guzman sprawling to the ground. Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again. Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil. \nCOLTER \n(READING) \"Hasnan Guzman, Vice President, Shell Oil.\"\u009d Must be a cover. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Philadelphia train now approaching. Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase. \nCOLTER Where the hell's your phone? Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS. Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back. Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and malice. \nCOLTER I thought so. Now let's see you try to -- A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots, looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is \nTHE EXPRESS TRAIN Closing in on the station. The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION. Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's cell phone. Which has remained off. \nCOLTER You didn't do it. Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned out by the ROAR of \nTHE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER. Everything stops. Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into smothering, forgetful SILENCE... For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than before), the same flickering after-image appears: \nTHIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD -- This time they all connect into \nTHE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nThe SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang on and gasp for air. \nCOLTER Holy fuck! \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Stabilize. Lower your pulse. Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight suit. The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's sweated off five pounds. \nGOODWIN Do you need to urinate? \nCOLTER A fucking train just ran over me. \nGOODWIN Do you need to urinate? \nCOLTER How are you doing this? Am I on some kind of drug? \nGOODWIN Did you find the bomber? \nCOLTER I didn't find the bomber. You fooled me with the Middle Eastern guy. I went for the diversion. What kind of freaky simulation is this? Let me out of here! \nGOODWIN Which Middle Eastern guy? Be specific. \n", "test1_true": "GOODWIN You've already been told what you need to know. Discipline your memory. Limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you. Everything else is irrelevant. \nCOLTER Irrelevant? Killing me each time is irrelevant? \nGOODWIN You do not die. As you can see, you simply return to us. \nCOLTER How? How can you do that? Silence. \nCOLTER Who's the man with the pipe? \nGOODWIN Say again? \nCOLTER There was a man smoking a pipe. I saw him on the monitor. Who's he? How does he fit into this? \nGOODWIN The man with the pipe isn't here right now. \nCOLTER Let me talk to him. This isn't right. I'm not your prisoner. Goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges. \nGOODWIN You feel unsatisfied with our relationship? \nCOLTER What is this? Why are you talking like that? Is this some kind of script? \nGOODWIN If Guzman, the Middle Eastern man, is innocent, as you maintain, who might be the guilty party? \nCOLTER Who cares? I'm tired of this. \nGOODWIN This isn't a game, Captain. \nCOLTER Then what is it? Don't you already know who the bomber is? Don't you have all the answers? \nGOODWIN We have no answers. Only corpses. A weird beat. \nCOLTER Corpses? Whose corpses? The passengers? \nGOODWIN Some were too badly burned to be identified. \n(MORE) \nGOODWIN (CONT'D) The heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage. Is this the truth? Or another evasive answer? His mind pulled in all kinds of unpleasant directions. \nCOLTER These were real people? \nGOODWIN Yes. \nCOLTER This really happened? \nGOODWIN Yes. \nCOLTER When? \nGOODWIN Today. \nCOLTER Today?! The train blew up today? \nGOODWIN It was attacked this morning, at 7:57 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. Six miles outside of New York City. Colter's head is spinning. \nCOLTER You're lying. I don't believe it. \nGOODWIN What do your senses tell you? His senses tell him it's true. But how can he accept it? \nCOLTER Where am I, right now, as we speak? \n", "test1_id": 1338, "test2_input": "GOODWIN (V.O.) Captain...? The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then dissolves. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Goodwin. You're with Beleaguered Castle. You are safe. All your needs will be met here. Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking cursor. \nFADE TO BLACK. A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain? The sound drives away the image, replacing it with \nTHE JACK OF CLUBS \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Captain, just tell me what you see. Just look and speak. Groggy breathing. A ragged voice: \nCOLTER (V.O.) I see a card. \nGOODWIN (V.O.) Very good. Very, very good. \nINT. ISOLATION UNIT \nOn Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach. Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching there, a nightmare, ruling over him. On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the situation. \nGOODWIN Are you comfortable? Are you warm? Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing entirely from existence. \nGOODWIN Do you need to urinate? Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak. \nGOODWIN Beleaguered Castle is waiting for your report. Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the 1970s, comes on: \nCOMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Hearing Test. First sequence. Left ear. A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES. \nCOMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Hearing Test. First sequence. Right ear. The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert. \nGOODWIN Captain, I know you can hear me. Did you find the bomber? Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting. \nCOMPUTER VOICE (V.O.) Memory Thread One: \"When Lily woke, she had the bed to herself. She sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver.\"\u009d Goodwin stops the audio. \nGOODWIN As you're collecting your thoughts, I should tell you there's been another development. A terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train. \n(MORE) \nGOODWIN (CONT'D) This began broadcasting over the Internet a half hour. We've traced it to central Asia. \nON THE MONITOR A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far- away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a flickering camp fire and a tea service. The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It begins speaking to the camera. \nMUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER (on camera, in accented \nENGLISH) By now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance. God willing, you will soon suffer another. Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even listening. \nMUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER These attacks will show you that you will never be safe. You can secure your borders. But what can you do against one of your own citizens? One who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding? You cannot stop this. Time has run out. The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of Goodwin. \nCOLTER Let me talk to Rutledge. \nGOODWIN So you've decided to speak. \nCOLTER Rutledge. Get him. \nGOODWIN We appreciate your desire for further discussion. Perhaps at a later date. \nCOLTER Will you let me out of here? Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations. \nGOODWIN Frankly, Captain, we're disappointed. \nCOLTER Find Rutledge! Now! \n", "test2_true": "COLTER Stop! Stop reading from your goddamn script! \nGOODWIN Perhaps we overestimated your abilities. \nCOLTER I swear to fucking Christ! \nGOODWIN Please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given. Perhaps a few memory exercises would help. \nCOLTER I don't need your criticism and I don't need your memory exercises, you gutless freak. And by the way, that bomb is detonated by a cell phone. When activated, the phone's display screen displays caller ID information. Caller ID. I wonder if that information would be useful to Beleaguered Castle. For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of the cold clinician goes back up. \nGOODWIN Very well. We're ready for that information. \nCOLTER You'll have to send me back. I didn't get a good look at it. But I will next time. Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical. \nGOODWIN What assurance do we have you'll be able to read the screen before the device detonates? \nCOLTER Goodwin, there's no time left. Send... me... back. Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers... intently scanning... There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE. \nCLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished. Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the arm. She gestures down the aisle to \nCOLTER Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone. Behind him, the Computer Engineer gets up. \nCOMPUTER ENGINEER Hey, do you have my phone? People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just starts walking faster. \nCOMPUTER ENGINEER \n(UPSET) Dude, give me back my phone! \nINT. SECOND CAR - MORNING \nThe Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car. PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it \nCLICKS SHUT. \nINT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING \nBreathless, Colter has just finished shutting the door and is about to use the cell phone when sees THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL Looking over at him in surprise. \nCOLTER Sorry. Wrong turn. Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment. \nINT. SECOND CAR - MORNING \nJust as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the other way. \nINT. FIRST CAR - MORNING \nSweating a bit now, Colter is keying in a number on the cell phone as he walks. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Operator. City and listing. \nCOLTER Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis Air Force Base. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Connecting you. A tingle up his spine. The call connects. \nPOST OPERATOR (V.O.) Post Operator. \nCOLTER Is this... Nellis Air Force Base? \n", "test2_id": 1339, "test3_input": "COLTER Man. Just when I think I understand this... \nGOODWIN \n(NERVOUS) There's not much time. They think I'm re-initializing the system. One last look at her. That's all I can give you. If that. \nCOLTER They'll nail your ass for this. \nGOODWIN If I had any feelings, I'd worry about that. But, as you've maintained, I do not. The strange path of their relationship. Ending at last at simple, grudging respect. \nCOLTER Roger that. \nMACHINERY BEGINS TO HUM. \nGOODWIN This is Beleaguered Castle signing off. Acknowledge final transmission. \nCOLTER Final transmission acknowledged. \n(BEAT) Thank you, Goodwin. Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter. The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake. Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the last image of his world a quiet benediction. \nINT. CORRIDOR - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nSipping a cup of coffee, Rutledge lingers at a window, contemplating his future. \nINTERCOM (V.O.) Dr. Rutledge, extension 16. Blinking out of reverie, he goes over to a wall phone and punches an extension. \nRUTLEDGE This is Rutledge. He listens. His face darkens. \nRUTLEDGE Shit. He SLAMS down the phone and starts RUNNING. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter is back on the train. It is morning again, seventeen minutes before the destruction. He's back in the navy blazer. The slacks. The commuters, caught up in their individual concerns, ignore Colter. But he looks on them with an appreciation approaching joy. For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this world. Attuned to the motion of the train. The sun on his face. And across from him, oblivious, working away on her sketch pad, is Christina. The best sight of all. \nINT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nBanks of MACHINERY are RUNNING. Rutledge comes charging in. Flustered. Barking questions. \nRUTLEDGE What is this? Who authorized this? \nTECHNICIAN We don't know, sir. But Source Code is up and running again. \nRUTLEDGE Where's Goodwin? The chair at the console is EMPTY. \nTECHNICIAN No idea, sir. A DIGITAL CLOCK ticks down from 17 minutes: 15:28... 15:27... \nRUTLEDGE What the hell is he doing? \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter drinks in the sight of Christina. Finally he gets up and walks off down the aisle. As soon as he's gone, Christina looks up. She's observed his interest in her. Doesn't quite know what to make of it. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter is by himself in the exit door area. From his jacket he takes out a CELL PHONE. \nCLOSE ON -- THE CELL PHONE SCREEN As he dials 9-1-1. The call connecting... \nOPERATOR (V.O.) 9-1-1. What is the nature of your emergency? \nINT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY \n", "test3_true": "RUTLEDGE Shut it down. \nTECHNICIAN Sir? \nRUTLEDGE Shut down the Source Code. Right now. The technician hesitates. \nRUTLEDGE (CONT'D) Fine. I'll do it myself. Rutledge sits down at the controls. \nTECHNICIAN I wouldn't do that. Rutledge gives a dismissive snort. And yet he pauses. \nRUTLEDGE And why not? \nTECHNICIAN We've never interrupted Source Code in mid run. We'd have to literally pull the plug. It could damage the processors. \nRUTLEDGE Let it finish, then. No harm in that, I guess. \n(OMINOUS) All of you are in deep shit, I promise you. As for Goodwin, he'll never make it off this base. Rutledge picks up a phone. \nTECHNICIAN I don't think that's where he's headed. Rutledge considers. And then catches on. \nRUTLEDGE He wouldn't. Looks up at the technician. Grows more and more uneasy. Snapping his attention back to \nTHE COUNTDOWN CLOCK Which reads: 12:42. Before it hits 12:41, Rutledge is already out of his chair and RUNNING for the door. \nRUTLEDGE Seal the ICU. I want a detachment of MPs meeting me on the way there. \nINT. TRAIN - MORNING \nColter walks down the aisle. Looks at HIS WATCH -- 12 minutes, 40 seconds. The train begins to SLOW DOWN. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Now approaching Newark Station. Newark Station, next stop. The Computer Engineer begins to wake up. As he does, Colter passes by, deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into the engineer's hand without being noticed. Derek packs up his things. We see him hide his wallet into a gap in the seat cushions and get up. \nThe College Kid, also getting up, notices Derek's wallet, picks it up and hurries after him. \nCOLLEGE STUDENT Hey, you dropped this. \nDEREK Wow. Thanks. Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet. Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it all to happen. The station slides into view. No one on the platform. \nINT. STAIRWELL - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nRutledge furiously descends, shoving people out of his way. \nINT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY \nRutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card through the scanner. It comes up RED. \nRUTLEDGE What?! He tries again. Red. The door stays LOCKED. \nEXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING \nThe train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits quietly at the doors. Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform, together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Newark Station. Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching. As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him, already pushing open the doors to the station. All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the station and sees \nTHROUGH THE OPEN DOORS In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS. Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for an outdoor stairwell. Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS. Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster, but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking. The train, oddly, is still sitting there. As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform. Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally -- \nPOLICE COMMANDER \n(CALLING OUT) Derek Frost. Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however, SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one another through the window. \nPOLICE COMMANDER Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us. An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform. \n", "test3_id": 1340}

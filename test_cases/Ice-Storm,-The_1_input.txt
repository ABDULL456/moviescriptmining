DOROTHY Ted took me to see it. 
JANEY Ted, how romantic. 
DOROTHY I have to say, the movie didn't do much for me. But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that -- 
JUMP CUT: 
The boys are pouring wine. 
JIM -- pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like there's no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in line's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice it's that Reverend Edwards -- 
BEN The Unitarian? The new one? 
JIM Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile. 
BEN He's either got his head in the clouds or up his -- 
DOROTHY I hear he's slept with half the women in his congregation -- 
TED Lucky bastard! 
As this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben. 
BEN Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there Mikey. Here, I -- 
Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is, Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice. 
CUT TO: 
The boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out coffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the coffee pot with some nervousness. 
DOROTHY (unconvincing) So fascinating. Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing? 
BEN No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money. It's -- 
ELENA Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- 
BEN (with a bit too much conviction) And as usual no one believed me... 
Silence. 
CUT TO: 
The dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the table. She stacks a plate on top of another. 
JANEY Please don't. 
ELENA It's not a bother. 
JANEY I insist. (beat) Don't touch them. 
Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice. 
ELENA Oh. 
JANEY (realizing she's gone too far) It's really quite all right. 
ELENA Of course. 
INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
The party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight. 
DOROTHY And to think -- they met at a key party of all things. 
ELENA A key party? 
DOROTHY You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic. 
JANEY Ironic? 
DOROTHY (caught out) Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is Rod. 
INT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT 
The guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks. 
ELENA Thank you Janey.

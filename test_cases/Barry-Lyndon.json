{"test1_input": "At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick. \nEXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) A little later on, as I rode towards Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant people assembled round a one-horse chair, and my friend in green, as I thought, making off half-a-mile up the hill. \nA footman howls, at the top of his voice. \nFOOTMAN Stop thief! \nBut the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just befallen. \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #1 Sure, you might have kept him off with your blunderbush! \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #2 O the coward!  To let the Captain bate you, and he only one eye! \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #3 The next time my lady travels, she'd better leave you at home! \nRODERICK What is this noise, fellows? \nRoderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off. \nPulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance to the chair-window. \nRODERICK What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship? \nMRS. O'REILLY Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him \"good luck.\" \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #1 Sure, he's the friend of the poor, and good luck to him. \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #2 Was it any business of ours? \nRODERICK (shouting) Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. (to Mrs. O'Reilly) Have you lost much? \nMRS. O'REILLY Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees... \nFOOTMAN Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much. Didn't he return you the thirteen pence in copper, and the watch, saying it was only pinchbeck? \nMRS. O'REILLY Don't be insolent, or I'll report you to the Captain. \nFOOTMAN Sorry, ma'am. \nHe shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction that the Captain has vanished. \nMRS. O'REILLY That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me. \nRODERICK I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap. \nMRS. O'REILLY But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...? \nRODERICK O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins. \nEXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY \nThey stop at the inn. \nRODERICK (very gallantly) As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home? \nMRS. O'REILLY (smiling) That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins. \nHe gives her two gold pieces. \nINT.  INN - DAY \nRoderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal. \nWe will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum. \nMRS. O'REILLY You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver. \nPaying the bill. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Perhaps had I been a little older in the world's experience, I should have begun to see that Madame O'Reilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be; but, as it was, I took all her stories for truth, and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces I had lent her. \nEXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT \nThey ride by. \n", "test1_true": "EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) We stopped at length at a house of rather mean appearance, and were let into a passage which had a great smell of supper and punch. \nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaptain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap. Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife. \nRODERICK I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin. (pours a glass) Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father? \nRODERICK Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset. \nRODERICK Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY I have heard of them. \nThere are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a cracked dish before them. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY My love, I wish I had known of your coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just finished the most delicious venison pasty, which His Grace the Lord Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of sillery from his own cellar.  You know the wine, my dear?  But as bygones are bygones, and no help for them, what say ye to a fine lobster and a bottle of as good claret as any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these things from the table, and make the mistress and our young friend welcome to our home. \nCaptain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to give to Betty. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I don't seem to have any small change. May I borrow a ten-penny piece to give to the girl? \nMRS. O'REILLY I have some money, my dear.  Here, Betty, go to the fishmonger and bring back our supper, and mind you get the right change. \nShe takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to her. \nINT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER \nThey are eating. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Our supper was seasoned, if not by any great elegance, at least by a plentiful store of anecdotes, concerning the highest personages of the city, with whom, according to himself, the captain lived on terms of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be behind hand with him, I spoke of my own estates and property as if I was as rich as a duke. \nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe couple wishing Roderick goodnight. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Had I been an English lad, the appearance of the chamber I occupied might, indeed, have aroused instantly my suspicion and distrust. But we are not particular in Ireland on the score of neatness, hence the disorder of my bed-chamber did not strike me so much. \nBroken door. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Was there a lock to the door, or a hasp to fasten it to? \nDress lying over bed. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Though my counterpane was evidently a greased brocade dress of Mrs. O'Reilly. \nCracked mirror. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And my cracked toilet-glass not much bigger than a half-crown, yet I was used to these sort of ways in Irish houses, and still thought myself to be in that of a man of fashion. \nDrawers, full of junk. \nRODERICK (V.O.) There was no lock to the drawers, which, when they did open, were full of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes, stays, and rags. \nINT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of events, he has his first woman. \nINT.  COACH - DAY \nRoderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY I needn't ask whether you had a comfortable bed.  Young Fred Pimpleton slept in it for seven months, during which he did me the honor to stay with me, and if he was satisfied, I don't know who else wouldn't be. \nEXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY \nRoderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends. Various cuts. \nRODERICK (V.O.) After breakfast, we drove out to Phoenix Park, where numbers of the young gentry were known to Mrs. O'Reilly, to all of whom she presented me in such a complimentary way that, before half an hour, I had got to be considered as a gentleman of great expectations and large property. \n", "test1_id": 207, "test2_input": "A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed than to turn back, and he rides into their midst, approaching a group of officers. \nHe presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map. \nDuring the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if Roderick will honor him with his company. \nTo avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer, and the two men mount up, and ride off together. \nEXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY \nRoderick and Galgenstein riding together. \nDialogue under voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN What is your uncle's name? \nRODERICK (slowly) O'Grady. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (with a laugh) Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady... \nEXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY \nRoderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads together, jogging on. \nThey pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a red-coated Hanoverian sergeant. \nHe exchanges signs of recognition with Captain Galgenstein. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN It hurts my feelings to be obliged to commune with such wretches, but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and hence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh.  They get five-and- twenty thaler a man from our government for every man they bring in.  For fine men -- for men like you. (he adds laughing) They would go as high as hundred. \nEXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON \nRoderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely- looking place. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner? \nRODERICK This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe? \nRoderick smiles. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you. \nRODERICK The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers. \nThey enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place. \nA couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their horses are littered under a shed hard by. \nLounging about the place are some men, and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their hats to the captain. \nThe inn has something foreboding about it, and the men shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (explaining the gate) Parties of French horsemen are about the country, and one cannot take too many precautions against such villains. \nThe two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his bedroom. \nRoderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his pains. \nThey enter into supper. \nINT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON \nA dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely creature which had been expected; and the captain, laughing, says: \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a soldier has many a time a worse. \nTaking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the captain's is laid. \nThe hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine, at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a considerable ill-humor. \nRODERICK (when she leaves) Where's the beauty you promised me? \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (laughing and looking hard at Roderick) It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile. \n", "test2_true": "RODERICK (sternly) Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN I have acted as I think fit. \nRODERICK Sir, I'm a British officer. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up? \nRODERICK Neither! \nSpringing at him like a tiger. \nBut, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard. He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off, and says, from the other end of the table where he stands dodging Roderick, as it were. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Advance a step, and I send this bullet into your brains! \nThe door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed with musket and bayonet to aid their captain. \nThe game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the wine, had removed his sword. \nRODERICK I volunteer. \nEXT.  A ROAD - DAY \nPrussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of them. \nCaptain Galgenstein rides by. \nRODERICK (V.O.) At the close of the Seven Years' War, the Prussian army, so renowned for its disciplined valor, was officered and under-officered by native Prussians, it is true, but was composed for the most part of men hired or stolen, like myself, from almost every nation in Europe. The deserting to and fro was prodigious. \nEXT.  A FIELD - DAY \nPrussian punishment gauntlet. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The life the private soldier led was a frightful one to any but the men of iron courage and endurance.  The punishment was incessant. \nEXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) I was not near so unhappy, in spite of all, as I had been on my first enlisting in Ireland.  At least, there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness my shame, and that is the point which I have always cared for most. \nRape, pillage and burn. \nBrief thematic repeat of British army version. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I reasoned with myself thus:  \"Now you are caught, there is no use in repining -- make the best of your situation, and get all the pleasure you can out of it.  There are a thousand opportunities of plunder, offered to the soldier in war time, out of which he can get both pleasure and profit; make use of these, and be happy.\" \nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT \nPrussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons. \nRoderick fighting. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I do not intend to make a history of battles in the Prussian any more than in the English service.  I did my duty in them as well as another, and there was not a braver, cleverer, handsomer, and, I must own, wickeder soldier in the Prussian army. \nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY \nRODERICK I had formed myself to the condition of the proper fighting beast; on a day of action, I was savage and happy. \nRoderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life. \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nRoderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in saving Captain Galgenstein. \nColonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of the regiment. \nCOLONEL BULOW You are a gallant soldier, and have evidently come of good stock; but you are idle, dissolute, and unprincipled; you have done a deal of harm to the men; and, for all your talents and bravery, I am sure you will come to no good. \nRODERICK I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken regarding my character.  I have fallen into bad company, it is true; but I have only done as other soldiers have done; and, above all, I have never had a kind friend and protector before, to whom I might show that I was worthy of better things.  The Colonel may say I am a ruined lad, and send me to the devil; but be sure of this, I would go to the devil to serve the regiment. \nCaptain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's performance. \nBERLIN - 1763 \nRODERICK (V.O.) Soon after the war ended, our regiment was garrisoned in the capital, the least dull, perhaps, of all the towns of Prussia; but that does not say much for its gaiety. \nINT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 208, "test3_input": "The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY \nRoderick caning young Brookside. \nRODERICK (V.O.) As it is best to nip vice in the bud, and for a master of a family to exercise his authority in such a manner as that there may be no question about it, I took every opportunity of coming to close quarters with Master Brookside. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nMany guests around the table. \nRODERICK (V.O.) He always chose the days when company, or the clergy, or gentry of the neighborhood were present, to make violent, sarcastic, and insolent speeches. \nBrookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick. \nBROOKSIDE Dear child, what a pity it is I am not dead for your sake!  The Cosgroves would then have a worthy representative, and enjoy all the benefits of the illustrious blood of the James' of Duganstown, would they not, Mr. James Cosgrove? \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT \nRoderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the punishment without crying. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick's reunion with his mother. \nPresent are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and others. \nMrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an only child, after a twelve-year absence from him. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick and mother feeding Patrick. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nRoderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nMother at dinner with the family, in a strained atmosphere. \nINT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of the sleeping Patrick. \nMOTHER Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see that my darling boy has attained a position I always knew was his due, and for which I pinched myself to educate him.  Little Patrick is a darling boy, and you live in great splendor, but how long will it last? Your lady-wife knows she has a treasure she couldn't have had, had she taken a duke to marry her, but if, one day, she should tire of my wild Roderick and his old-fashioned Irish ways, or if she should die, what future would there be for my son and grandson? \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother. \nMOTHER You have not a penny of your own, and cannot transact any business without the Countess' signature. Upon her death, the entire estate would go to young Brookside, who bears you little affection.  You could be penniless tomorrow, and darling Patrick at the mercy of his stepbrother. \nINT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother. \nMOTHER I shall tell you a secret -- I shall not rest until I see you Earl of Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord Viscount. \nShe smooths down Roderick's hair. \nMOTHER This head would become a coronet. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nRoderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by a lamb. \nMOTHER These things entail considerable expense, and you will need your lady's blessing, but the young boy forms the great bond of union between you and her ladyship, and there is no plan of ambition you could propose in which she would not join for the poor lad's benefit, and no expense she will not eagerly incur, if it might be any means be shown to tend to his advancement. You have important friends, and they can tell you how these things are done. \nINT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT \nStanding away from the play tables, Roderick chats with Lord West, a fat giant of a man. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table. \nLORD WEST Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? \nRODERICK By name only. \n", "test3_true": "INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY \nRoderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of Crabs. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And for a five-hundred guinea fee, paid to his City law-firm, Lord West kindly arranged a meeting with that old scamp and swindler, Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs. \nEARL OF CRABS Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a person, he or she is safe.  There is no question about them any more.  My friends are the best people.  I don't mean the most virtuous, or, indeed, the least virtuous, or the cleverest, or the stupidest, or the richest, or the best born, but the \"best\" -- in a word, people about whom there is no question.  I cannot promise you how long it will take. You can appreciate it is not an easy matter.  But any gentlemen with an estate, and ten-thousand a-year should have a peerage. \nINT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY \nRoderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the Duke of Rutland. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The striving after this peerage, I consider to have been one of the most unlucky dealings at this period.  I made unheard of sacrifices to bring it about.  I can tell you bribes were administered, and in high places too -- so near the royal person of His Majesty that you would be astonished were I to mention what great personages condescended to receive our loans. \nINT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I lavished money here, and diamonds there. \nEXT.  FARMLAND - DAY \nRoderick and the seller, riding over a prospective property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the property. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I bought lands at ten times there value. \nINT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT \nA musical evening. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I gave repeated entertainments to those friends to my claims who, being about the royal person, were likely to advance it. \nINT.  STATELY HOME - DAY \nRoderick buying pictures. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I purchased pictures and articles of vertu at ruinous prices. \nEXT.  RACES - DAY \nRoderick laughing and paying a bet. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I lost many a bet to the royal dukes, His Majesty's brothers. \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nReviewing the company of troops. \nRoderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of Rutland. \nRODERICK (V.O.) One of the main causes of expense which this ambition of mine entailed upon me was the fitting out and arming of a company of infantry from the Hackton estates, which I offered to my gracious sovereign for the campaign against the American rebels.  These troops, superbly equipped and clothed, were embarked at Portsmouth in the year 1778. \nINT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY \nGeorge III meeting people and stopping to talk to Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And the patriotism of the gentlemen who raised them was so acceptable at court that, on being presented by my Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended to notice me particularly and said: \nGEORGE III That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise another company, and go with them, too! \nINT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) Crabs was really one of the most entertaining fellows in the world, and I took a sincere pleasure in his company, besides the interest and desire I had in cultivating the society of the most important personages of the realm. \nRoderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble. \nJOHNSON If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I should mind my horses and tailors and not trouble myself about letters. \nLaughter, Roderick bristles. \nRODERICK Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave most grossly, treating my opinions with no more respect than those of a schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know a great deal more than me, because you quote your \"Aristotle\" and \"Plato,\" but can you tell me which horse will win at Epsom Downs next week?  Can you shoot the ace of spades ten times without missing? If so, talk about Aristotle and Plato with me. \nBOSWELL (roars) Do you know who you're speaking to?! \nJOHNSON Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had no right to brag of my Greek, gentlemen, and he has answered me very well. \nRODERICK (pleased) Do you know ever a rhyme for Aristotle? \n", "test3_id": 209}

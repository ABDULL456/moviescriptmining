PARK - DAY \nBrief shot of duel. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My father, who was well-known to the best circles in this kingdom under the name of roaring Harry James, was killed in a duel, when I was fifteen years old. \nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY \nMrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a distance. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My mother, after her husband's death, and her retirement, lived in such a way as to defy slander.  She refused all offers of marriage, declaring that she lived now for her son only, and for the memory of her departed saint. \nEXT.  STREET - DAY \nMother and son walking together. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My mother was the most beautiful women of her day.  But if she was proud of her beauty, to do her justice, she was still more proud of her son, and has said a thousand times to me that I was the handsomest fellow in the world. \nEXT.  CHURCH - DAY \nMother and son entering church. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The good soul's pleasure was to dress me; and on Sundays and Holidays, I turned out in a velvet coat with a silver-hilted sword by my side, and a gold garter at my knee as fine as any lord in the land.  As we walked to church on Sundays, even the most envious souls would allow that there was not a prettier pair in the kingdom. \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nA picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My uncle's family consisted of ten children, and one of them was the cause of all my early troubles; this was the belle of the family, my cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name. \nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nA sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden, stables, barn and farm. \nIdealized images of Dorothy. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Ah!  That first affair, how well one remembers it!  What a noble discovery it is that the boy makes when he finds himself actually and truly in love with some one!  A lady who is skilled in dancing or singing never can perfect herself without a deal of study in private.  So it is with the dear creatures who are skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for instance, was always practicing, and she would take poor me to rehearse her accomplishments upon... \nDorothy talking with the exciseman. \nRODERICK (V.O.) ... or the exciseman, when he came his rounds. \nDorothy talking to the steward. \nRODERICK (V.O.) ... or the steward. \nDorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a book. \nRODERICK (V.O.) ... or the poor curate. \nDorothy talking to the apothecary's lad. \nRODERICK (V.O.) ... or the young apothecary's lad from Dugan's Town whom I recollect beating once for that very reason. \nRoderick, fighting with apothecary's lad. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The torments of jealousy she made me endure were horrible. \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nDOROTHY I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set. \nRODERICK Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden? \nDOROTHY I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him? \nRODERICK But you refused me, Dorothy. \nDOROTHY Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world. \nRODERICK If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is. \nDOROTHY But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter. \nRoderick falls silent. \nEXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN \nThey come to an old, high bridge, over a stream, sufficiently deep and rocky. \nDOROTHY Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side. \nRODERICK I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them. \nDOROTHY What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me? \nRODERICK Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us. \nDOROTHY Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes -- \nShe never finished the word for, maddened by the continual recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts: \nRODERICK Hold tight to my waist! \nAnd, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the parapet, into the deeper water below. \nThe horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she sinks, and screams as she rises. \nRoderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore. \nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nVarious cuts showing illness and convalescence. \nRoderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse. \nMother brings a tray of food. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I went home, and was ill speedily of a fever, which kept me to my bed for a week. \nDorothy visiting him. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Dorothy visited me only once, but I quitted my couch still more violently in love than I had been ever before. \nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nThe air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs down the road, as brisk as a young fawn. \nHe encounters an orderly whistling \"Roast Beef of Old England,\" as he cleans down a cavalry horse. \nRODERICK Whose horse, fellow, is that? \nORDERLY Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs to my captain, and he's a better fellow nor you any day. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I did not stop to break his bones, as I would on another occasion, for a horrible suspicion had come across me, and I made for the garden as quickly as I could. \nRoderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling against his arm. \nSome distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The fact is that, during the week of my illness, no other than Captain Best was staying at Castle Dugan, and making love to Miss Dorothy in form. \nCAPTAIN BEST No, Dorothy, except for you and four others, I vow before all the gods, my heart had never felt the soft flame. \nDOROTHY Ah, you men, you men, John, your passion is not equal to ours.  We are like -- like some plant I've read of -- we bear but one flower, and then we die! \nCAPTAIN BEST Do you mean you never felt an inclination for another? \nDOROTHY Never, my John, but for thee!  How can you ask me such a question? \nEXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY \nHarry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best, flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a grenadier company.  The party are laughing together. \nRODERICK (to Captain Grogan) I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword. \nRODERICK I'll match any man with the sword. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now. \nRODERICK Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN It must have been some other gate. \nThey alight from their horses, and join and salute the other gentlemen. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN I have just explained to Mister James that Captain Best is lame, and that swords are impossible. \nHARRY Oh, yes!  Dead lame. \nHarry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red. \nHARRY And very lucky for you, Roderick, my boy.  You were a dead man else, for he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't he, Grogan? \nCAPTAIN GROGAN A regular Turk.  I never yet knew the man who stood to Captain Best. \nHARRY Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry, Roderick.  You can easily say that. \nCAPTAIN BEST If the young feller will go to Dublin, as proposed... \nRODERICK I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize -- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as to hell! \nGrogan takes him aside. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off. \nRODERICK A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize. \nHARRY (with a laugh to Grogan) There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose? \nCAPTAIN BEST (in a big voice) Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan? \nHARRY Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols. (with some emotion to Roderick) God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire. \nRODERICK This is not one of my pistols. \nHARRY They are all right, never fear. It's one of mine.  Yours will serve, if they are needed, for the next round. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit him there under the gorget; see how the fool shows himself open. \nMichael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal. \nIt is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover his man well. \nCaptain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are given. \nAt \"three\" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls. \nTHE SECONDS (crying out) He's down!  He's down! \nRunning towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes his head. \nMICHAEL He's hit here, in the neck. \nLaying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under his gorget. \nHARRY How is it with you? \nThe unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once more and falls backwards. \nMICHAEL (with a scowl) The young fellow has begun well. You had better ride off, young sir, before the police are up.  They had wind of the business before we left Kilwangan. \nRODERICK Is he quite dead? \nMICHAEL Quite dead. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN Then the world's rid of a coward. It's all over with him, Roddy -- he doesn't stir. \nAt this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick. \nEXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) A little later on, as I rode towards Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant people assembled round a one-horse chair, and my friend in green, as I thought, making off half-a-mile up the hill. \nA footman howls, at the top of his voice. \nFOOTMAN Stop thief! \nBut the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just befallen. \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #1 Sure, you might have kept him off with your blunderbush! \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #2 O the coward!  To let the Captain bate you, and he only one eye! \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #3 The next time my lady travels, she'd better leave you at home! \nRODERICK What is this noise, fellows? \nRoderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off. \nPulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance to the chair-window. \nRODERICK What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship? \nMRS. O'REILLY Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him \"good luck.\" \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #1 Sure, he's the friend of the poor, and good luck to him. \nCOUNTRY FELLOW #2 Was it any business of ours? \nRODERICK (shouting) Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. (to Mrs. O'Reilly) Have you lost much? \nMRS. O'REILLY Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees... \nFOOTMAN Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much. Didn't he return you the thirteen pence in copper, and the watch, saying it was only pinchbeck? \nMRS. O'REILLY Don't be insolent, or I'll report you to the Captain. \nFOOTMAN Sorry, ma'am. \nHe shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction that the Captain has vanished. \nMRS. O'REILLY That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me. \nRODERICK I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap. \nMRS. O'REILLY But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...? \nRODERICK O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins. \nEXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY \nThey stop at the inn. \nRODERICK (very gallantly) As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home? \nMRS. O'REILLY (smiling) That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins. \nHe gives her two gold pieces. \nINT.  INN - DAY \nRoderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal. \nWe will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum. \nMRS. O'REILLY You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver. \nPaying the bill. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Perhaps had I been a little older in the world's experience, I should have begun to see that Madame O'Reilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be; but, as it was, I took all her stories for truth, and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces I had lent her. \nEXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT \nThey ride by. \nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) I had little notion then that I had got amongst a set of impostors -- that Captain O'Reilly was only an adventurer, and his lady a person of no credit.  The fact was, a young man could hardly have fallen into worse hands than those in which I now found myself. \nAn evening of gambling. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Their friends were always welcome on payment of a certain moderate sum for their dinner after which, you may be sure, that cards were not wanting, and that the company who played did not play for love merely. \nVarious cuts of the characters present. \nRODERICK (V.O.) What could happen to a man but misfortune from associating with such company?  And in a very, very short time I became their prey. \nRoderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in a single hand. \nWe see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not. \nHe pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum his mother gave him. \nRODERICK I shall have to write out a note for the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly. \nEXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN \nRoderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by Councillor Mulligan. \nCOUNCILLOR MULLIGAN Master Roderick, you appear a young fellow of birth and fortune; let me whisper in your ear that you have fallen into very bad hands -- it's a regular gang of swindlers; and a gentleman of your rank and quality should never be seen in such company.  The captain has been a gentleman's gentleman, and his lady of no higher rank.  Go home, pack your valise, pay the little trifle you owe me, mount your mare, and ride back again to your parents -- it's the very best thing you can do. \nRoderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him down the street. \nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nRoderick enters. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Into a pretty nest of villains, indeed, was I plunged!  When I returned to my bed-chamber, a few hours later, it seemed as if all my misfortunes were to break on me at once. \nValise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah? \nRODERICK Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland! \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver! \nRODERICK Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud. \nHe holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the linen. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown, but Roderick James of the devil only knows where... \nCaptain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear. \nRODERICK Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell you why I was obliged to alter my name, which is James and the best name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir, because, on the day before I came to Dublin, I killed a man in deadly combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a Captain in His Majesty's service; and if you offer to let or hinder me in the slightest way, the same arm which destroyed him is ready to punish you. \nSo saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and giving a \"ha, ha!\" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings herself between them. \nMRS. O'REILLY Dearest Roderick -- be pacified. O'Reilly, you don't want the poor child's blood.  Let him escape -- in Heaven's name, let him go. \nCAPTAIN O'REILLY (sulkily) He may go hang for me, and he's better be off quickly, for I shall go to the magistrate if I see him again. \nO'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins to cry. \nEXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY \nRoderick riding down the street, with his valise. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Where was now a home for the descendant of the James?  I was expelled from Dublin by a persecution occasioned, I must confess, by my own imprudence.  I had no time to wait and choose.  No place of refuge to fly to. \nINT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) There was a score of recruiting parties in the town beating up for men to join our gallant armies in America and Germany. \nRoderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly make him welcome. \nRODERICK I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am a young gentleman in difficulties; I have killed an officer in a duel, and I am anxious to get out of the country. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But I needn't have troubled myself with any explanations; King George was in too much want of men to heed from whence they came -- and a fellow of my inches was always welcome.  Indeed, I could not have chosen my time better.  A transport was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a wind. \nEXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY \nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY \nRoderick and his company. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Were these memoirs not characterized by truth, I might easily make myself the hero of some strange and popular adventures. \nEXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY \nOfficers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But I saw no one of the higher ranks that day than my colonel and a couple of orderly officers riding by in the smoke -- no one on our side, that is.  A poor corporal is not generally invited into the company of commanders and the great. \nRoderick advancing. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But, in revenge, I saw, I promise you, some very good company on the French part, for their regiments of Lorraine and Royal Cravate were charging us all day; and in the sort of melee high and low are pretty equally received.  I hate bragging, but I cannot help saying that I made a very close acquaintance with the colonel of the Cravates. \nRoderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel, amidst shouts and curses. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And finished off a poor little ensign, so young, slender, and small, that a blow from my pigtail would have dispatched him. \nRoderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt of his musket. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And in the poor ensign's pocket found a purse of fourteen louis d'or, and a silver box of sugar- plums, of which the former present was very agreeable to me. \nRoderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the ensign. \nRODERICK (V.O.) If people would tell their stories of battles in this simple way, I think the cause of truth would not suffer by it.  All I know of this famous fight of Minden, except from books, is told here above. \nCaptain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls. \nA brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham. \nCAPTAIN Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's your company. \nRODERICK (V.O.) That was all the epitaph my brave patron got. \nRoderick kneels above Grogan. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN I should have left you a hundred guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed run of ill-luck last night at faro. \nHe gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him. \nRODERICK (V.O.) When we came back to our ground, which we presently did, he was lying still, but he was dead.  Some of our people had already torn off his epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled his purse. \nEXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY \nShort cuts to voice over. \nRoderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn. \nRODERICK (V.O.) After the death of my protector, Captain Grogan, I am forced to confess that I fell into the very worst of courses and company.  In a foreign country, with the enemy before us, and the people continually under contribution from one side or the other, numberless irregularities were permitted to the troops.  It is well for gentlemen to talk of the age of chivalry; but remember the starving brutes whom they lead -- men nursed in poverty, entirely ignorant, made to take pride in deeds of blood -- men who can have no amusement but in drunkenness, debauch, and plunder. It is with these shocking instruments that your great warriors and kings have been doing their murderous work in the world. \nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) The year in which George II died, our regiment had the honor to be present at the Battle of Warburg, where Prince Ferdinand once more completely defeated the Frenchmen. \nLieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help. \nRODERICK (V.O.) During the action, my lieutenant, Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was struck by a musket-ball in the side. He had shown no want of courage in this or any other occasion where he had been called upon to act against the French; but this was his first wound, and the young gentleman was exceedingly frightened by it. \nLAKENHAM Here, you, Roderick James.  I will pay you five guineas if you will carry me into the town which is hard by those woods. \nRoderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry him towards the nearby town of Warburg. \nEXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY \nIn order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces, which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her old, half-blinded father. \nThey are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily convinces the people that they have only to deal with a person of honor. \nINT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY \nThey carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their five guineas. \nRODERICK (V.O.) We put the patient to bed, and he paid me the stipulated reward.  A young surgeon, who desired nothing better than to take himself out of the fire of the musketry, came presently to dress the wound. \nIn his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking, with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be billeted there. \nEXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY \nA quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed than to turn back, and he rides into their midst, approaching a group of officers. \nHe presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map. \nDuring the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if Roderick will honor him with his company. \nTo avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer, and the two men mount up, and ride off together. \nEXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY \nRoderick and Galgenstein riding together. \nDialogue under voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN What is your uncle's name? \nRODERICK (slowly) O'Grady. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (with a laugh) Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady... \nEXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY \nRoderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads together, jogging on. \nThey pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a red-coated Hanoverian sergeant. \nHe exchanges signs of recognition with Captain Galgenstein. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN It hurts my feelings to be obliged to commune with such wretches, but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and hence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh.  They get five-and- twenty thaler a man from our government for every man they bring in.  For fine men -- for men like you. (he adds laughing) They would go as high as hundred. \nEXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON \nRoderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely- looking place. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner? \nRODERICK This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe? \nRoderick smiles. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you. \nRODERICK The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers. \nThey enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place. \nA couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their horses are littered under a shed hard by. \nLounging about the place are some men, and a pair of sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their hats to the captain. \nThe inn has something foreboding about it, and the men shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (explaining the gate) Parties of French horsemen are about the country, and one cannot take too many precautions against such villains. \nThe two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his bedroom. \nRoderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his pains. \nThey enter into supper. \nINT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON \nA dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely creature which had been expected; and the captain, laughing, says: \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a soldier has many a time a worse. \nTaking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the captain's is laid. \nThe hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine, at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a considerable ill-humor. \nRODERICK (when she leaves) Where's the beauty you promised me? \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (laughing and looking hard at Roderick) It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Simplicity was our secret. Everything successful is simple. If, for instance, I wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an ace, king; if I said, \"Punch or wine, my lord?\" hearts was meant. If \"Wine or punch?\" clubs.  If I blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary; and then, I warrant you, some pretty trials of skill would take place.  The Prince of Turbingen, although so young, had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was only from hearing Ritter von Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn three times when the Chevalier had the ace of trumps, that I knew we were Greek to Greek, as it were. \nThe Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier. \nPRINCE Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me. \nCHEVALIER I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated? \nPRINCE (glaring at Roderick) I don't know. \nCHEVALIER Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won. \nPRINCE Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time. \nCHEVALIER Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation. \nPRINCE I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night. \nHe exits. \nEXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY \nRoderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN Was he cheated? \nRODERICK In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN Hmm-mmmm. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN What are the Chevalier's intentions? \nRODERICK I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible. \nRODERICK The Prince left him only that choice. \nThe Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and speak in whispers. \nThen they return to Roderick. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN Will you be able to return here tomorrow without arousing suspicion? \nINT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY \nCHEVALIER Tell them I intend to demand satisfaction from the Prince. \nRODERICK But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost. \nCHEVALIER Have no fear.  It will come out well for me. \nRODERICK I believe they will deport you. \nCHEVALIER I have faced that problem before. \nRODERICK But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me? \nCHEVALIER (with a smile) Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go. \nRODERICK But how, sir? \nEXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY \nRoderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country. \nRODERICK When is he to go? \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Has he sent the challenge yet? \nRODERICK Not yet, but I believe he intends to. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN Then this must be done tomorrow. \nRODERICK What is to be done? \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN (in his imperious Dutch manner) Roderick!  Are you there? \nNo answer. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN The rogue is gone out. \nAction as per voice over. \nCHEVALIER (V.O.) Straightaway he makes for the red box where I keep my love letters, my glass eye which I used to wear, my two sets of Paris teeth, and my other private matters that you know of.  He first tries a bunch of keys, but none of them fit the English lock.  Then he takes out of his pocket a chisel and hammer, and falls to work like a professional burglar, actually bursting open the little box!  Now was my time to act! I advance towards him armed with an immense water-jug.  I come noiselessly up to him just as he has broken the box, and, with all my might, I deal him such a blow over the head as smashes the water-jug to bits, and sends the captain with a snort lifeless to the ground.  Then I ring all the bells in the house; and shout, and swear, and scream, \"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord! -- Murder! -- Fire!\" until the whole household comes tumbling up the stairs. \nCHEVALIER Where is my servant?  Who dares to rob me in open day?  Look at the villain whom I find in the act of breaking my chest open!  Send for the police, send for his Excellency the Austrian Minister!  All Europe shall know of this insult! \nLANDLORD Dear heaven!  We saw you go away three hours ago. \nCHEVALIER Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed all morning.  I am ill -- I have taken physic -- I have not left the house this morning!  Where is that scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where are my clothes and wig? \nCHAMBERMAID I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is off in your honor's dress. \nCHEVALIER And my money -- my money!  Where is my purse with forty-eight frederics in it?  But we have one of the villains left, Officers, seize him. \nLANDLORD (more and more astonished) It's the young Herr Galgenstein. \nCHEVALIER What!  A gentleman breaking open my trunk with hammer and chisel -- impossible! \nCHEVALIER (V.O.) Herr Galgenstein was returning to life by this time, with a swelling on his skull as big as a saucepan; and the officers carried him off, and, to make a long story short, poor Galgenstein is now on his way to Spandau; and his uncle, the Minister of Police Galgenstein, has brought me five hundred louis, with a humble request that I would leave Berlin forthwith, and hush up this painful matter. \nINT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in particularly good order with the Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court was, at this period, the most brilliant in all Europe. \nThe Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who will perform at the party. \nRODERICK (V.O.) He spent fabulous sums on the ballets and operas.  All the ballerinas were pretty, and they all boasted that they had all at least once made their amorous sovereign happy. \nRoderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with the nobility, and dancing minuets. \nRODERICK (V.O.) There was not a party of the nobility to which the two Irish gentlemen were not invited, and admired, nor where we did not make the brave, the high-born and the beautiful talk to us.  There was no man in Europe more gay in spirits, more splendid in personal accomplishment, than young Roderick James. \nEXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN \nRoderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early parade. \nINT.  COACH - DAWN \nRoderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and yawns. \nRODERICK (V.O.) What a delightful life did we now lead!  I knew I was born a gentleman, from the kindly way in which I took to the business, as business certainly it is. \nINT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY \nRoderick in a tub, being washed by a servant. \nRODERICK (V.O.) For though it seems all pleasure, yet I assure any low-bred persons who may chance to read this, that we, their betters, have to work as well as they; though I did not rise until noon, yet had I not been up at play until long past midnight? \nINT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY \nHis hair being done. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I came into it at once, and as if I had never done anything else all my life.  I had a gentleman to wait upon me, a French friseur to dress my hair of a morning. \nINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA candle-lit supper. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I knew the taste of chocolate as by intuition almost, and could distinguish between the right Spanish and the French before I had been a week in my new position. \nINSERTS - JEWELRY \nAction and cuts as voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I had rings on my fingers, watches in both my fobs, trinkets, and snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each outvying the other in elegance. \nINT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY \nAs described. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I had the finest natural taste for lace and china of any man I ever knew. \nEXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) Tender Hegenheim. \nINT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) Brilliant Langeac. \nRoderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end, has a narrow pink ribbon. \nHe displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs. \nLANGEAC I will put in on you myself. \nShe puts it on, out of shot. \nLANGEAC There you are, dressed by my hand. It is nearly the same thing; but despite the fineness and transparency of the skin, the little fellow pleases me less well in costume.  It seems that this covering degrades him, or degrades me -- one of the other. \nRODERICK Both, my angel.  It was Love who invented these little jackets:  for he had to ally himself with Precaution. \nINT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel. \nCOUNT I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady. \nRODERICK Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love? \nCOUNT Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals. \nRODERICK Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her. \nCOUNT Then you yield to me. \nRODERICK On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you. \nCOUNT Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs. \nRODERICK That is a trifle strong. \nCOUNT Take to your legs, low Irish dog. \nRoderick smiles at him. \nRODERICK Your Excellency has wantonly insulted me.  That being so, I conclude that you hate me, Monseigneur, and that hence you would be glad to remove me from the number of the living.  In this wish, I can and will satisfy Your Excellency. \nEXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING \nRoderick's sword duel with the Count. \nDetails to be worked out. \nINT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian officer, Lieutenant Dascher. \nRODERICK (V.O.) It was my unrivaled skill with sword and pistol, and readiness to use them, that maintained the reputation of the firm. \nTowards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker tells him so to his face. \nLieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game, takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's adjurations, or to Roderick's. \nRoderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard cue and swings it at Dascher's face. \nHe wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and runs at Roderick, who is unarmed. \nThe marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the waist and prevents murder. \nDASCHER I see that you are without your sword, but I believe you are a man of mettle.  Will you give me satisfaction? \nRODERICK I shall be delighted; but you have lost and you must pay me the money before we meet, for, after all, you cannot pay me when you are dead. \nANOTHER OFFICER I will undertake to pay you the 20 louis, but only tomorrow morning at the meeting. \nEXT.  FIELD - DAY \nOn the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher, and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket and hands them to Roderick, saying: \nDASCHER I may have been mistaken, but I mean to make you pay deadly for your brutality. \nHis piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers. \nFrom the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols, and sword. \nRoderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves. \nThe Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning and in no condition to resist robbers. \nRoderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune and his life at the highest price. \nHis carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons. \nIn this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain, and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the strength to hold in. \nThe chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats. \nSome falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his pistol. \nThe leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick. During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless Chevalier and two of them are killed. \nAfter they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who utters some appropriate last words, then dies. \nHis servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants, each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready to obey his orders. \nEXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY \nRoderick's carriage arrives. \nRODERICK (V.O.) After making suitable arrangements for the Chevalier's burial, in proper accord with his church, I traveled to Spa, which was now in season, alone, to continue my profession which formerly had the support of my friend and mentor. \nINT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT \nCrowds surround Roderick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I was by this time one of the best- known characters in Europe; and the fame of my exploits, my duels, my courage at play, would bring crowds round me in any public society where I appeared. \nINT.  CASINO - NIGHT \nAttractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The passion for play is stronger than the passion for gallantry; the gamester at Spa has neither time to stop to consider the merits of a woman, nor the courage to make sacrifices for her. \nEXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY \nThe Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two servants. \nRODERICK (V.O.) In evoking the recollections of these days, I have nothing but pleasure.  I would if I could say as much of a lady who will henceforth play a considerable part in the drama of my life -- I mean the Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal acquaintance I made at Spa, very soon after the tragic events which caused me to quit Germany. \nCloser shot of the Countess. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A Countess and a Viscountess in her own right. \nCloser shot of Sir William Cosgrove. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She was the wife of her cousin, the Right Honorable Sir William Reginald Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and Minister to George II and George III of several of the smaller courts of Europe. \nCloser shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them in the care of his governor. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She was the mother to Viscount Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted, little boy, about whom his father was more than indifferent, and whom his mother never saw. \nINT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT \nShots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth. \nSIR WILLIAM Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own. \nLaughter at the table. \nRODERICK I am obliged to observe, Sir William Cosgrove, that since you are bound for the next world much sooner than I am, I will depend on you to get comfortable quarters arranged for me. \nLaughter. \nSIR WILLIAM Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry. \nRODERICK Would you have me spend my life all alone? \nSIR WILLIAM In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge. \nCOUNTESS The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me. \nRODERICK Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent. \nCOUNTESS But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer. \nRoderick laughs and kisses her. \nCOUNTESS Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are? \nRODERICK With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight. \nShe laughs. \nCOUNTESS And if she does not choose to show you some kindness? \nRODERICK Then I will respectfully take leave of her. \nCOUNTESS You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree? \nRODERICK Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived. \nCOUNTESS Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end? \nRODERICK I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet. \nShe laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit. \nEXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT \nCoach and four moves slowly along. \nINT.  COACH - NIGHT \nThey kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her dress.  He stops. \nRODERICK Will we always leave it at this? \nCOUNTESS Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it. \nRODERICK I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away. \nCOUNTESS Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires. \nRODERICK Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew. \nCOUNTESS My husband has convinced me of the contrary. \nRODERICK Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty. \nShe silences him with her fingertips. \nCOUNTESS Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it. \nRODERICK O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours! \nThey kiss ardently. \nRODERICK (V.O.) To make a long story short, her ladyship and I were in love six hours after we met; and after I once got into her ladyship's good graces, I found innumerable occasions to improve my intimacy, and was scarcely ever out of her company. \nEXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK \nAction as per voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I shall never forget the astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove when, on one summer evening, as he was issuing out to the play-table, in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's barouche and four came driving into the courtyard of the house which they inhabited and, in that carriage, by her ladyship's side, sat no other than \"the vulgar Irish adventurer,\" as she was pleased to call me. \nSir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on their part. \nINT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT \nMaking ardent love. \nCOUNTESS Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes. \nRODERICK Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy. \nCOUNTESS As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much. \nRODERICK (V.O.) We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  \"Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?\" \nThe Countess begins to cry and leaves the room. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY \nRoderick caning young Brookside. \nRODERICK (V.O.) As it is best to nip vice in the bud, and for a master of a family to exercise his authority in such a manner as that there may be no question about it, I took every opportunity of coming to close quarters with Master Brookside. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nMany guests around the table. \nRODERICK (V.O.) He always chose the days when company, or the clergy, or gentry of the neighborhood were present, to make violent, sarcastic, and insolent speeches. \nBrookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick. \nBROOKSIDE Dear child, what a pity it is I am not dead for your sake!  The Cosgroves would then have a worthy representative, and enjoy all the benefits of the illustrious blood of the James' of Duganstown, would they not, Mr. James Cosgrove? \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT \nRoderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the punishment without crying. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick's reunion with his mother. \nPresent are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and others. \nMrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an only child, after a twelve-year absence from him. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick and mother feeding Patrick. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nRoderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nMother at dinner with the family, in a strained atmosphere. \nINT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of the sleeping Patrick. \nMOTHER Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see that my darling boy has attained a position I always knew was his due, and for which I pinched myself to educate him.  Little Patrick is a darling boy, and you live in great splendor, but how long will it last? Your lady-wife knows she has a treasure she couldn't have had, had she taken a duke to marry her, but if, one day, she should tire of my wild Roderick and his old-fashioned Irish ways, or if she should die, what future would there be for my son and grandson? \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother. \nMOTHER You have not a penny of your own, and cannot transact any business without the Countess' signature. Upon her death, the entire estate would go to young Brookside, who bears you little affection.  You could be penniless tomorrow, and darling Patrick at the mercy of his stepbrother. \nINT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother. \nMOTHER I shall tell you a secret -- I shall not rest until I see you Earl of Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord Viscount. \nShe smooths down Roderick's hair. \nMOTHER This head would become a coronet. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nRoderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by a lamb. \nMOTHER These things entail considerable expense, and you will need your lady's blessing, but the young boy forms the great bond of union between you and her ladyship, and there is no plan of ambition you could propose in which she would not join for the poor lad's benefit, and no expense she will not eagerly incur, if it might be any means be shown to tend to his advancement. You have important friends, and they can tell you how these things are done. \nINT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT \nStanding away from the play tables, Roderick chats with Lord West, a fat giant of a man. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table. \nLORD WEST Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? \nRODERICK By name only. \nGOLDSMITH (laughing) Port, if you please. \nJOHNSON Waiter, bring on of Captain James' rhymes for Aristotle. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And we had six rhymes for Aristotle before we left the coffee house that evening. \nINT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT \nEARL OF CRABS Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove, who wishes to arrange a dinner party next week for sixty guests. \nHENRI I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend? \nRODERICK As much as possible. \nHENRI As much as possible? \nRODERICK Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly. \nHENRI All the same, you must name an amount. \nRODERICK It is entirely up to you.  I want the best. \nEARL OF CRABS May I suggest five hundred guineas? \nRODERICK Will that be enough? \nHENRI Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more. \nRODERICK All right, five hundred guineas. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY \nRoderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him, aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and his accountant explains the charge. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The life I was leading was that of a happy man, but I was not happy. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY \nRoderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his brother. \nPATRICK Papa, please don't flog Brookside today.  It wasn't his fault -- really is wasn't. \nRoderick ignores him. \nRODERICK (V.O.) By now, young Brookside was of so wild, savage, and insubordinate a nature that I never had the least regard for him.  As he grew up to be a man, his hatred for me assumed an intensity quite wicked to think of and which, I promise you, I returned with interest. \nHe drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door behind him. \nINT.  LIBRARY - DAY \nRoderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol. \nBROOKSIDE (grinding his teeth) Look you now, Mister Roderick James, from this moment on, I will submit to no further chastisement from you! Do you understand that? \nRODERICK Give me that pistol. \nBROOKSIDE Take heed, Mister James.  I will shoot you if you lay hands on me now, or ever again.  Is that entirely clear to you, sir? \nRoderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I decided, at once, to give up that necessary part of his education. In truth, he then became the most violent, daring, disobedient, scapegrace, that ever caused an affectionate parent pain; he was certainly the most incorrigible. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY \nBrookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor, Reverend Hunt. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt attempted to punish my Lord Brookside; but I promise you the rogue was too strong for him, and leveled the Oxford man to the ground with a chair, greatly to the delight of little Patrick, who cried out:  \"Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him, thump him!\" \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nBrookside and Patrick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) With the child, Brookside was, strange to say, pretty tractable. He took a liking to the little fellow -- I like him the more, he said, because he was \"half a Cosgrove.\" \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT \nRODERICK (V.O.) Another day, it was Patrick's birthday, we were giving a grand ball and gala at Hackton, and it was time for my Patrick to make his appearance among us. \nThere is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing- room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older. \nRoderick and the broker. \nBROKER Your wife's life is as well known among the insurance societies in London, as any woman in Christendom, and, I'm sorry to say there is not one of them willing to place another policy against her ladyship's life. One of them even had the impudence to suggest that your treatment of the Countess did not render her life worth a year's purchase. \nEXT.  STUD FARM - DAY \nRoderick buying a horse. \nRODERICK (V.O.) In the midst of my difficulties, I promised to buy a little horse for my dear little Patrick, which was to be a present for his eighth birthday, that was now coming on.  I may have had my faults, but no man shall dare to say of me that I was not a good and tender father. \nRoderick admires the horse. \nRODERICK (V.O.) It was a beautiful little animal, and stood me in a good sum.  I never regarded money for that dear child. \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nThe horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to ride him. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But the horse was a bit wild, and he kicked off one of the horse-boys who rode him at first, and broke the lad's leg. \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nRoderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back of a wagon. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But he was a beautiful animal and would make a fine horse for Patrick after he had a bit of breaking-in. \nEXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the horse-boys. \nRODERICK Timmy, take the injured lad to see the doctor, and then bring the horse to Doolan's farm, and tell him to break him in thoroughly.  Tell him it's for little Patrick, and that I'll be over to see him next week. \nHORSE-BOY Yes, sir. \nRODERICK One more thing, and listen well, I don't want little Patrick to know where the horse is being kept.  It's going to be surprise for his birthday. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nPatrick rushes out to greet his father. \nPATRICK Hello, papa! \nRoderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him. \nPATRICK Did you buy the horse, papa? \nRODERICK Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week. \nPATRICK But I will have it on my birthday, won't I? \nRODERICK Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we? \nHe walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses him. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was a prince; his breeding and manners, even at his early age, showed him to be worthy of the two noble families from whom he was descended, and I don't know what high hopes I had for the boy, and indulged in a thousand fond anticipations as to his future success and figure in the world, but stern Fate had determined that I should leave none of my race behind me. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor, Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first, then approaches Roderick. \nPATRICK (kissing him) Good night, papa. \nRODERICK Good night, my little darling. \nPATRICK Papa? \nRODERICK Yes? \nPATRICK One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa? \nRODERICK (angered) What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story? \nHUNT I don't know, sir. \nPATRICK Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh, thank you, papa!  Thank you! \nHe hugs his father. \nCOUNTESS Promise me, Patrick, that you will not ride the horse except in the company of your father. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and nervous, after our blessed boy's catastrophe, became more agitated than ever, and plunged into devotion with so much fervor that you would have fancied her almost distracted at times. \nCountess sees visions. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She imagined she saw visions.  She said an angel from heaven told her that Patrick's death was a punishment to her for her neglect of her firstborn.  Then she would declare that Brookside was dead. \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY \nRoderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills. \nRODERICK (V.O.) By now, my financial affairs were near to ruin.  I could not get a guinea from any money-dealer in London.  Our rents were in the hands of receivers by this time, and it was as much as I could do to get enough money from the rascals to pay my wine-merchants their bills.  Our property was hampered, and often as I applied to my lawyers and agents for money, would come a reply demanding money of me for debts and pretended claims which the rapacious rascals said they had on me. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nMother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her bags. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My mother was the only person who, in my misfortune, remained faithful to me -- indeed, she has always spoken of me in my true light, as a martyr to the rascality of others, and a victim of my own generous and confiding temper. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nMother supervising kitchen staff. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She was an invaluable person to me in my house, which would have been at rack and ruin before, but for her spirit of order and management and her excellent economy in the government of my rapidly dwindling household staff. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY \nRoderick and his mother. \nRODERICK (V.O.) If anything could have saved me from the consequences of villainy in others, it would have been the admirable prudence of that worthy creature. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT \nAction as per voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She never went to bed until all the house was quiet and all the candles out; you may fancy that this was a matter of some difficulty with a man of my habits who had commonly a dozen of jovial fellows to drink with me every night, and who seldom, for my part, went to bed sober. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nActions as per voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Many and many a night, when I was unconscious of her attention, has that good soul pulled my boots off, and seen me laid by my servants snug in bed, and carried off the candle herself... \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY \nAction as per voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) ... and been the first in the morning, too, to bring me my drink of small beer.  It was my mother's pride that I could drink more than any man in the country. \nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT \nRoderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire, which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My mother discovered that always, before my lady-wife chose to write letters to her milliner, she had need of lemons to make her drink, as she said, and this fact, being mentioned to me, kind of set me a-thinking. \nRODERICK (reading letter aloud) \"This day, three years ago, my last hope and pleasure in life was taken from me, and my dear child was called to Heaven.  Where is his neglected brother, whom I suffered to grow up unheeded by my side, and whom the tyranny of the monster to whom I am united drove to exile, and, perhaps to death?  I pray the child is still alive and safe. Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide of a wretched mother, who acknowledges her crime, her coldness towards you, and now bitterly pays for her error!  What sufferings, what humiliations have I had to endure!  I am a prisoner in my own halls.  I should fear poison, but then I know the wretch has a sordid interest in keeping me alive, and that my death would be the signal for his ruin.  But I dare not stir without my odious, hideous, vulgar gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who purses my every step.  I am locked into my chamber at night, like a felon, and only suffered to leave it when ordered into the presence of my lord, to be present at his orgies with his boon-companions, and to hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of intoxication.\" \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner. \nRODERICK (V.O.) It was not possible to recover the name for whom the note was intended, but it was clear that, to add to all my perplexities, three years after my poor child's death, my wife, whose vagaries of temper and wayward follies I had borne with for twelve years, wanted to leave me.  I decided it best not to reveal to her ladyship our discovery, that we might still intercept and uncover further schemes with might be afoot. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT \nA few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Yet I was bound to be on my guard that she should not give me the slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined the next day.  I set my mother to keep sharp watch over the moods of her ladyship, and you may be sure that her assistance and surveillance were invaluable to me.  If I had paid twenty spies to watch her lady, I should not have been half so well served as by the disinterested care and watchfulness of my excellent mother. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY \nRoderick walking with the Countess. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me: \nCOUNTESS Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me. \nRoderick kisses her. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I was in a particularly good humor that day, and we had a sort of reconciliation. \nRODERICK (V.O.) One night we stayed at Reading. \nINT.  INN - NIGHT \nRoderick and his wife at dinner. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My lady and I agreed that, with the money, we would go to France, and wait there for better times, and that night, over our supper, formed a score of plans both for pleasure and retrenchment.  You would have thought it was Darby and Joan together over their supper. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRoderick and his wife making love. \nRODERICK (V.O.) O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect Lady Cosgrove's smiles and blandishments, how happy she seemed to be on that night!  What an air of innocent confidence appeared in her behavior, and what affectionate names she called me!  I am lost in wonder at the depth of her hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised that an unsuspecting person like myself should have been a victim to such a consummate deceiver? \nEXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY \nThe coach drives up. \nRODERICK (V.O.) We were in London at three o'clock, an half-an-hour before the time appointed. \nINT.  STAIRCASE - DAY \nRoderick and the Countess looking for the office. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and in an unlucky hour, I entered it. \nThey climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon. \nThe Countess seems agitated and faint. \nWhen they get to the door, she stops in front of it. \nCOUNTESS Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure there is danger.  There's time yet, let us go back -- anywhere! \nThe Countess has put herself before the door in a theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand. \nHe pushes her away to one side. \nRODERICK Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool. \nCOUNTESS Old fool! \nShe jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig. \nCOUNTESS Say Lady Cosgrove is here! \nShe stalks down the passage, muttering:  \"Old Fool.\" \nINT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY \nTapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his parchments and tin boxes. \nHe advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes, rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence. \nThe lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back in a moment. \nIn the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons and pistols, and Lord Brookside. \nLady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son, crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her preserver, her gallant knight. \nThen, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of invective which quite astonishes him. \nCOUNTESS Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted the most crafty and treacherous monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a fool when I married you, and gave up other and nobler hearts for your sake -- yes, I was a fool when I forgot my name and lineage to unite myself with a base-born adventurer -- a fool to bear, without repining, the most monstrous tyranny that ever woman suffered; to allow my property to be squandered; to see women as base and low-born as yourself... \nTAPEWELL For heaven's sake, be calm. \nTapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a threatening look in Roderick's eye. \nThe Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury, screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and always beginning and ending the sentence with the word \"fool.\" \nRODERICK You didn't tell all, my lady -- I said \"old\" fool. \nBROOKSIDE I have no doubt that you said and did, sir, everything that a blackguard could say or do.  This lady is now safe under the protection of her relations and the law, and need fear your infamous persecutions no longer. \nRODERICK But you are not safe, and as sure as I am a man of honor, I will have your heart's blood. \nTAPEWELL Take down his words, constables; swear the peace against him. \nBROOKSIDE I would not sully my sword with the blood of such a ruffian.  If the scoundrel remains in London another day, he will be seized as a common swindler. \n", "test1_input": "When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and bursts into a passion of tears. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I must have sat for some hours bemoaning myself on the garden-bench, for the dinner-bell clanged as usual at three o'clock, which wakened me from my reverie. \nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY \nAs Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the scullion-girls and kitchen people. \nMAID The Englishman's still there, Master Roderick.  He's there in the parlor. Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat you, Master Roderick. \nINT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY \nRoderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover. \nUNCLE Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well? That's right. \nAUNT He'd better be home with his mother. \nUNCLE Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose she ate for breakfast -- didn't agree with her.  Take a glass of spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's health. \nIt is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry, and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and Roderick looks on as cold as stone. \nHis uncle is in high good-humor. \nUNCLE Dorothy, divide that merry thought with the captain!  See who'll be married first.  Jack Best, my dear boy, never mind a clean glass for the claret, we're short of crystal at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and the wine will taste none the worse. Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you please; this is a sort of toast that is drunk a great deal too seldom in my family, and you'll please to receive it with all the honors. Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Best, and long life to them.  Kiss her, Jack, you rogue; for faith, you've got a treasure. \nRODERICK (spring up) His already?! \nHARRY Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold your tongue! \nRODERICK (shouting) He has already been slapped in the face this morning, Captain John Best; he's already been called a coward, Captain John Best; and this is the way I'll drink his health. Here's your health, Captain John Best. \nRoderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he hardly has time to hear the general screaming and scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which Harry is belaboring him. \nHARRY You fool!  You great blundering marplot -- you silly beggarly brat -- (a thump at each) Hold your tongue! \nWhen Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever. \nUNCLE In Heaven's name, what does all the row mean?  Is the boy in fever again? \nHARRY (turning to his father) The fact is, sir, that the young monkey has fallen in love with Dorothy, and finding her and the captain mighty sweet in the garden today, he was for murdering Jack Best. \nCAPTAIN BEST (bristling up) And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I -- \nHARRY If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best. \nOn which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water, and answering never a word. \nRODERICK (in dignified tone) Mr. Best may also have satisfaction any time he pleases, by calling on Roderick James, Esquire, of Jamesville. \nHis uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain Grogan joins. \nRODERICK Captain Grogan, I beg you to understand that, for my cousin Harry, who has been my best friend through life, I could put up with rough treatment from him; yet, even that sort of treatment I will bear from him no longer; and any other person who ventures on the like will not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows that fact very well; and, if he's man, he'll know where to find me. \nUNCLE It is getting late, and your mother will be anxious about you.  One of you had better go home with him. (turning to his sons) Or the lad may be playing more pranks. \nHARRY Both of us ride home with Best here. \nCAPTAIN BEST I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I. \nHARRY You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that. \nUNCLE Why, you'll not be home till morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good ten miles from here. \nHARRY We'll sleep in Best's quarters. We're going to stop a week there. And, in another week, my boy. \nAnd here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN I'll go home with the boy. \nEXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY \nGrogan walks with Roderick. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father. \nRODERICK And so I am. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder? \n", "test1_true": "CAPTAIN GROGAN Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow. \nRODERICK He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second. \nThey embrace. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Poor fellow!  He was shot six months afterwards, at Minden, and I lost thereby a kind friend.  But we don't know what is in store for us, and that's a blessing. \nEXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY \nMother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan. \nRODERICK (V.O.) In spite of my precautions to secrecy, I half-suspected that my mother knew all from the manner in which she embraced me on my arrival, and received our guest, Captain Grogan. \nHis mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But she would not say a word about the quarrel, for she had a noble spirit, and would as lief have seen any one of her kindred hanged as shirking from the field of honor. \nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY \nRoderick waking up. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I never slept sounder in my life, though I woke a little earlier than usual, and you may be sure my first thought was of the event of the day, for which I was fully prepared. \nRoderick at table with paper and ink. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And now I sat down and wrote a couple of letters; they might be the last, thought I, that I should ever write in my life. \nSee him write:  \"Dearest Mother.\" \nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) Then I went down to breakfast, where my mother was waiting for me, you may be sure.  We did not say a single word about what was taking place. \nRoderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother starts up with a scream. \nMOTHER Thank God, it's fallen towards me! \nAnd then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Ah!  They have their faults, those mothers; but are there any other women like them? \nThere is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late father. \nA pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture. \nRoderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and gunpowder. \nEXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY \nCaptain Grogan and Orderly arrive. \nRODERICK Have you taken my message to him? \nCAPTAIN GROGAN The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now. \nRODERICK My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second? \nCAPTAIN GROGAN Your cousins go out with him. \nRoderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I didn't take leave of Mrs. James. The curtains of her bedroom-windows were down, and they didn't move as we mounted and trotted off. \nEXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nThey ride their horses at a leisurely pace. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN That's a very handsome sword you have there. \nRODERICK It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize. \nCAPTAIN GROGAN And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world. \nRODERICK I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality. \n", "test1_id": 207, "test2_input": "Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant. \nRODERICK Private Roderick James.  First Hanoverian Guards.  Captain Galgenstein sent for me. \nPRUSSIAN SERGEANT You may wait. \nRODERICK Thank you, sir. \nRoderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of loud talking behind the closed door. \nEnter a private huffing and puffing. \nPRIVATE Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with the Captain's furniture, but the driver says he is not supposed to unload it.  Is it possible for you to talk to him? \nExit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what is being said. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.) Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu! You are a model of probity!  You'll never succeed to my place, my dear nephew, if you are no wiser than you are just now.  Make the fellow as useful to you as you please.  You say he has a good manner and a frank countenance, that he can lie with assurance, and fight, you say, on a pinch.  The scoundrel does not want for good qualities.  As long as you have the regiment in terrorem over him, you can do as you like with him.  Once let him loose, and the lad is likely to give you the slip. Keep on promising him; promise to make him a general, if you like. What the deuce do I care?  There are spies enough to be had in this town without him. \nRoderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to the door. \nThen the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out, sees Roderick, smiles and say: \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein. \nRODERICK How do you do, sir? \nThe Minister nods. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas. \nRODERICK What is the service, sir? \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet. \nThe Captain smiles at Roderick. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN He speaks Italian and French indifferently; but we have some reason to fancy this Monsieur de Belle Fast is a native of your country of Ireland, and that he has come here as a spy. \nThe Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN Naturally, your knowledge of English makes you an ideal choice to go into his service.  Of course, you will not know a word of English; and if the Chevalier asks as to the particularity of your accent, say you are Hungarian.  The servant who came with him will be turned away today, and the person to whom he has applied for a faithful fellow will recommend you. \nRoderick nods. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well? \nRODERICK Only a very little, as soldiers do. \nCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys. \nMINISTER GALGENSTEIN Does this assignment interest you? \nRODERICK Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein. \nThe Minister studies Roderick, coldly. \nEXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY \nRoderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters. \nINT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCHEVALIER You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended? \nRODERICK Yes, sir.  Here is my letter. \nRoderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman, with which the Captain had taken care to provide him. \nAs the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the leisure to examine him. \nHe is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly, wearing rings, diamonds and laces. \nOne of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios, which fall over his lip. \nThe Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read the letter. \nCHEVALIER Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi? \n", "test2_true": "CHEVALIER You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach. \nRODERICK Herr Seebach was a very kind employer. \nCHEVALIER For whom else have you worked? \nRODERICK No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins. \nCHEVALIER Who else can give me information about you? \nRODERICK Only the agency of servants. \nThe Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for a few seconds, and then smiles. \nCHEVALIER You will do.  I will give you 30... a day.  I do not provide your clothing; you will sleep at home, and you will be at my orders every morning at seven o'clock. \nHe notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar. \nCHEVALIER Is there something wrong? \nHe goes up to Roderick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) It was very imprudent of me; but when I saw the splendor of his appearance, the nobleness of his manner, I felt it impossible to keep disguise with him.  You, who have never been out of your country know little what it is to hear a friendly voice in captivity; and there's a many a man that will understand the cause of the burst of feeling which was about to take place. \nThe Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder. \nRODERICK (as he speaks, bursting into tears) Sir, I have a confession to make.  I am an Irishman, and my name is Roderick James.  I was abducted into the Prussian army two years ago, and now I have been put into your service by my Captain and his uncle, the Minister of Police, to serve as a watch upon your actions, of which I am to give information to the same quarter.  For this odious service, I have been promised my discharge, and a hundred guineas. \nSobbing, Roderick falls into his arms. \nCHEVALIER The rascals!  They think to catch me, do they?  Why, young man, my chief conspiracy is a faro-bank. But the king is so jealous, that he will see a spy in every person who comes to his miserable capital, in the great sandy desert here. \nEXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY \nRoderick and the Chevalier walking. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood. \nCHEVALIER I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place. \nEXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY \nRoderick and the Chevalier walking. \nCHEVALIER My lad, I have been in every service; and, between ourselves, owe money in every capital in Europe.  I have been a rolling stone.  Play -- play has been my ruin!  That and beauty.  The women have made a fool of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft- hearted creature, and this minute, at sixty-two, have no more command of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer made a fool of me at sixteen. \nEXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY \nRoderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank. \nCHEVALIER The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards? \nRODERICK I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill. \nCHEVALIER We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing. \nINT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY \nQuick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of cards and the dice-box. \nEXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY \nRoderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I carried my little reports to Captain Galgenstein at the Garden house outside the town where he gave me rendezvous.  These reports, of course, were arranged between me and the Chevalier beforehand.  I was instructed, and it is always the best way, to tell as much truth as my story would possible bear. \nDialogue comes up from under voice over. \nRODERICK He goes to church regularly -- he is very religious, and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast.  Then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner, which is served at noon.  After dinner, he writes his letters, if he has any letters to write; but he has very little to do in this way.  His letters are to the Austrian envoy, with whom he corresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in English, or course, I look over his shoulder.  He generally writes for money.  He makes his party with Calsabigi, the lottery contractor, the Russian attaches, two from the English embassy, my lords Deuceace and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer, and a few more.  He wins often, but not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott, the English Minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play. \nINT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nThe Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen, including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals the cards. \nRODERICK (V.O.) It was agreed that I should keep my character of valet, that in the presence of strangers I should not know a word of English, that I should keep good lookout on the trumps when I was serving the champagne and punch about; and, having a remarkably fine eyesight, and a great natural aptitude, I was speedily able to give my dear benefactor much assistance against his opponents at the green table. \nSeveral cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice over. \n", "test2_id": 208, "test3_input": "Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is shocked into an apprehensive silence. \nINT.  COACH - DAY \nYoung Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap. \nEXT.  ROAD - DAY \nAs the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the school-children and the laboring people are loud in their \"hurrahs\" for her ladyship. \nRoderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the occasion. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nFifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I had not arrived at the pitch of prosperity, and having, at thirty years of age, by my own merits and energy, raised myself to one of the highest social positions that any man in England could occupy, I determined to enjoy myself as becomes a man of quality for the remainder of my life. \nINT.  STABLES - DAY \nRoderick and his beautiful horses. \nEXT.  A STREAM - DAY \nRoderick and some companions fishing. \nEXT.  FIELDS - DAY \nRoderick and his friends riding. \nEXT.  FIELDS - DAY \nRoderick and friends shooting. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nRoderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist. \nRODERICK (V.O.) But it was not meant for me to finish my life as a man of quality and position.  Indeed, I am one of those born clever enough at gaining a fortune, but incapable of keeping one; for the qualities and energy, which lead a man to accept the first, are often the very causes of his ruin in the latter case; indeed, I know of no other reason for the misfortunes which finally befell me. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY \nRODERICK (V.O.) At the end of the year, Lady Cosgrove presented me with a son; Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in compliment to my royal ancestry, but what more had I to leave him than a noble name? \nEXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY \nTwo coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit. Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) We spent the season in London at our house in Berkeley Square. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe Countess alone and depressed. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Her ladyship and I lived, for a while, pretty separate when in London.  She preferred quiet, or, to say the truth, I preferred it, being a great friend to a modest, tranquil behavior in woman and a taste for the domestic pleasures. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY \nSeveral cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant, Patrick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Besides, she was a mother, and had great comfort in the dressing, educating, and dandling of our little Patrick for whose sake it was fit that she should give up the pleasures and frivolities of the world; so she left that part of the duty of every family of distinction to be performed by me. \nINT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT \nRoderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a beautiful woman. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY \nCountess crying and having an argument with Roderick. Live dialogue under voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Her ladyship's conversations with me were characterized by a stupid despair, or a silly blundering attempt at forced cheerfulness, still more disagreeable; hence, our intercourse was but trifling, and my temptations to carry her into the world or to remain in her society of necessity exceedingly small. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT \nA drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears. Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then ends scene. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She would try my temper, at home, too, in a thousand ways.  When requested by me to entertain the company with conversation, wit, and learning, of which she was a mistress; or music, of which she was an accomplished performer, she would, as often as not, begin to cry, and leave the room.  My company from this, of course, fancied I was a tyrant over her; whereas, I was only a severe and careful guardian of a silly, bad-tempered and weak- minded lady. \nEXT.  PARK - DAY \n", "test3_true": "RODERICK (V.O.) Despite the utter distaste with which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove, and, although I took no particular pains to disguise my feelings in general, yet she was of such a mean spirit that she pursued me with her regard, and would kindle up at the smallest kind word I spoke to her. \nINT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY \nRoderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various documents, and orders for payment. \nRODERICK (V.O.) And, in these fits of love, she was the most easy creature in the world to be persuaded, and would have signed away her whole property, had it been possible.  And, I must confess, it was with very little attention on my part that I could bring her into good humor, and, up to the very last day of our being together, would be reconciled to me, and fondle me, if I addressed her a single kind word.  Such is female inconsistency. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY \nRoderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over. \nRODERICK (V.O.) She was luckily very fond of her youngest son, and through him I had a wholesome and effectual hold on her; for if in any of her tantrums or fits of haughtiness, she pretended to have the upper-hand, to assert her authority against mine, to refuse to sign such papers as I might think necessary for the distribution of our large and complicated property. \nRoderick picks up baby Patrick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) I would have Master Patrick carried off to Chiswick for a couple of days; and I warrant me his lady- mother could hold out no longer and would agree to anything I proposed. \nThe Countess rushes to the window to see the child being put into a carriage. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY \nAnother quarrel. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel more than fashionable people do, and, for the first three years, I never struck my wife but when I was in liquor. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY \nRoderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the young Brookside's head. \nRODERICK (V.O.) When I flung the carving-knife at Brookside, I was drunk, as everybody present can testify, but as for having any systematic scheme against the poor lad, I can declare solemnly that, beyond merely hating him, I am guilty of no evil towards him. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY \nThe Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's nurse. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Do what one would to please her, my lady would never be happy or in good humor.  And soon she added a mean, detestable jealousy to all her other faults, and would weep and wring her hands, and threaten to commit suicide, and I know not what. \nShe screams and shouts something about suicide. \nHer son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Her death would have been no comfort to me, as I leave any person of common prudence to imagine; for that scoundrel of a young Brookside who was about to become my greatest plague and annoyance, would have inherited every penny of the property. \nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY \nRoderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of bills and papers, with his accountant. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Humble people envy us great men, and fancy that our lives are all pleasure.  But the troubles of poverty, the rascality of agents, the quibbles of lawyers are endless. My life at this period seemed to consist of nothing but drafts of letters and money-brokers relative to the raising of money, and the insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life, and innumerable correspondence with upholsterers, decorators, cooks, horsekeepers, bailiffs, and stewards. \nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY \nVarious cuts. \nBirthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old. \nGaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive presents. \nRODERICK (V.O.) My own dear boy, Patrick, was now five years old, and was the most polite and engaging child ever seen; it was a pleasure to treat him with kindness and distinction; the little fellow was the pink of fashion, beauty, and good breeding.  In fact, he could not have been otherwise, with the care both his parents bestowed upon him, and the attentions which were lavished upon him in every way. \nBrookside and Roderick. \nRODERICK (V.O.) Whereas, young Brookside had grown to be a very nasty and disrespectful fellow indeed.  In my company, he preserved the most rigid silence, and a haughty, scornful demeanor, which was so much the more disagreeable because there was nothing in his behavior I could actually take hold of to find fault with, although his whole conduct was insolent and supercilious to the highest degree. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY \nBrookside sitting alone reading a book. \nRODERICK (V.O.) In addition to this, the lad was fond of spending the chief part of his time occupied with the musty old books, which he took out of the library, and which I hate to see a young man of spirit pouring over. \nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY \nBrookside and the Countess. \nRODERICK (V.O.) The insubordination of that boy was dreadful.  He used to quote passages of \"Hamlet\" to his mother, which made her very angry. \nBrookside quoting \"Hamlet.\" \n", "test3_id": 209}

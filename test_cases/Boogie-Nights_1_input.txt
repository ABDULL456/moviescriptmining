DIRK 
When I close my eyes . . . I see this thing, 
a sign . . . I see this name in bright blue neon 
lights with a purple outline. And this name 
is so bright and so sharp that the sign -- 
it just blows up because the name is so powerful . . . . 
FLASH ON: 
A BRIGHT NEON SIGN IN BLUE LETTERING, WITH A PURPLE OUTLINE: 
DIRK DIGGLER 
DIRK (OC) 
It says, "Dirk Diggler." 
The NEON SIGN FLASHES, BUZZES, THEN BURSTS INTO AN ELECTRIC FLAME. 
BACK TO: 
51 EXT. JACUZZI - THAT MOMENT 
Back to Reed and Jack. They look at Dirk. 
JACK 
Heaven sent you here to this place, 
Dirk Diggler. You've been blessed. 
Dirk smiles. Reed smiles. Jack looks up and closes his eyes. 
FADE OUT, CUT TO: 
52 INT. JACK'S GARAGE/FILM STUDIO - DAY 
. . . . The film crew sets up lights and other equipment around a small "office" set. The crew consists of: Kurt Longjohn, Director of Photography. Rocky, Gaffer/Grip. Little Bill, Assistant Director. Scotty J. Is working as a utility/sound man. 
Jack is sipping coffee, conferring with Kurt about lighting. 
JACK 
How close? 
KURT LONGJOHN 
Give me twenty to thirty. I've got a 
couple tough shadows to deal with -- 
JACK 
Okay, but not too long, Kurt, right? 
Remember, there are shadows in real life. 
Little Bill approaches. 
LITTLE BILL 
You wanna go over this? 
JACK 
Yeah. Let's . . . . 
LITTLE BILL 
(reading from script) 
Okay. Set up is . . . here we go: 
1.) Amber talking to Becky about auditions. 
They make the phone call to the agency to 
send over some actors. 
2.) Enter Reed to audition for Amber. 
They go at it. Becky just watches. 
C.) Becky goes to the bathroom to jack-off 
and is interrupted by Amber. They get into it. 
E.) Enter Dirk -- 
(looks up) 
Who's Dirk Diggler? 
JACK 
The kid, Eddie, from the club. 
LITTLE BILL 
Good name. Anyway: 4.) Dirk enters. 
Meets with Becky. They go at it -- 
JACK 
I wanna change that -- that should be Amber. 
Dirk should be auditioning with Amber. 
Little Bill makes a note. Jack walks over to Becky, who's sitting in a chair, shaving her pubic hairs. 
JACK 
Becky, honey -- 
BECKY 
What? 
JACK 
What're you doing? We're shooting 
in twenty minutes. 
BECKY 
I'm shaving my bush -- 
JACK 
Now? 
BECKY 
It only takes two seconds, Jack. 
JACK 
Fine, fine. 
Jack continues to get everyone ready. 
JACK 
Alright everyone, let's go, let's go, 
we need to shoot this first scene -- 
we need to get one off -- 
CUT TO: 
53 INT. BEDROOM - DAY - LATER 
Dirk is sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed up in a brown suit and his hair is brushed back, parted down the middle. He paces a little, does some deep breathing, looks over script, etc. Scotty J. enters. 
SCOTTY J. 
Hey. Hi. Dirk. Dirk Diggler. 
DIRK 
Hi. 
SCOTTY J. 
I'm supposed to come get you. 
Tell you they're ready, now. 
DIRK 
Okay. 
SCOTTY J. 
You look really good. 
DIRK 
Thank you. 
SCOTTY J. 
You look really sexy. 
DIRK 
Thanks. 
SCOTTY J. 
I like your name. 
DIRK 
You do. 
SCOTTY J. 
It's really cool. 
DIRK 
Thanks. 
SCOTTY J. 
OK . . . well . . . whenever you're ready . . . 
I'll see you out there. 
Scotty J. exits. Dirk stands, takes a deep breath. CAMERA follows as he exits the room and walks through the house and into -- 
54 INT. GARAGE/FILM SET 
The crew is ready and waiting. Jack is there to greet him. 
JACK 
Ready, champ? 
DIRK 
Let's do this. 
They walk through the scene with Amber. 
JACK 
So we know the scene, we know the thing. 
You're gonna start outside the set, 
through that door, I'll call your name 
and action, that'll be your cue . . . come through 
the door, straight to the desk, right here, 
boom, you and Amber do the scene -- 
DIRK 
Do we go straight into having sex? 
JACK 
Is that alright? 
DIRK 
It would be better I think, y'know, 
so we don't break up the momentum

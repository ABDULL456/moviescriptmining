And this game is not out of reach for the Kids...can they hang in there and break the record? (etc,etc) Elders! Who's the lucky so and so? 
Mim from the "Adults" speaks into her mic. 
MIM It's gonna be me, Jimmy.

She stands up and crosses over to Jimmy.  This is for a ONE ON ONE final section speed round.  One Kid vs. One Adult. 
ANGLE, STANLEY. CAMERA pushes in on him and lands in CU. 
He takes his shirt out of his pants and tries to pull it down enough to cover the large wet stain in his pants. 
ANGLE, JIMMY AND MIM They chat about the game so far, etc. "They're quite a challenge, etc." 
ANGLE, STANLEY and RICHARD and JULIA. Stanley can't pull his shirt down enough to cover.  He turns to Richard and Julia; 
STANLEY I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time. 
RICHARD -- the fuck are you talking about? 
JULIA You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest. 
STANLEY I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it -- 
RICHARD Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass -- 
STANLEY I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always -- 
JIMMY (OC) KIDS! 
Jimmy looks over to the "Kids" panel. 
JIMMY Do I even have to ask?  Stanley, get your butt over here -- 
Stanley looks like a deer in headlights.  The AUDIENCE applauds.

INT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT 
The TELEVISION above the bar holds this moment where Stanley won't move.  DONNIE is seriously fucked up now and the CAMERA pushes in on him.  He glances around, up the television, sees Stanley.  BEAT. 
Thurston and the other folks around chat away, etc; 
DONNIE ...I'm sick....I'm sick here now..... 
They continue to chat, trying to ignore him now; 
DONNIE I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes.... 
THURSTON Mmm.Hmm. 
DONNIE You see? 
THURSTON Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold. 
DONNIE I'm sick. 
THURSTON Stay that way. 
DONNIE I'm sick and I'm in love. 
THURSTON You seem the sort of person who confuses the two. 
DONNIE That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE. 
Donnie looks to Brad, then: 
DONNIE HEY.  HEY. 
Brad looks.  Donnie stands up, backs away from the bar as he talks; 
DONNIE I love you.  I love you and I'm sick. (beat) I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender. (beat, crying now) You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson. 
THURSTON Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt -- 
DONNIE You mind your own bussines. 
THURSTON Gently, son -- 
DONNIE Brad, I know you don't love me now -- 
THURSTON "It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..." 
DONNIE -- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form. (Jimmy impersonation) "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you. (beat) And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us." (to Thurston) And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.

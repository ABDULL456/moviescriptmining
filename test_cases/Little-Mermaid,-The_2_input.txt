Eric: (Playing flute.) That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked everywhere, Max - where could she be? (On other side of rocks Ariel is washed up. Sebastion and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is amazed.) Scuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!  Look at ya!  Look at ya! There's something different.  Don't tell me - I got it.  It's your hairdo, right?  You've been using the dinglehopper, right?  No?  No huh, well let me see.  New . . . seashells?  No new seashells.  I gotta admit I can't put my foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I'll - Sebastian: SHE'S GOT LEGS, YOU IDIOT!  She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs.  Jeez, man . . . Scuttle: I knew that. Flounder: Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her. (Ariel tries to get up.) Sebastion: And she's only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe!  What would her father say? I'll tell you what her father'd say, he'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab, that's what her father'd say! I'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him.) . . . and don't you shake your head at me, young lady.  Maybe there's still time. If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for the rest of your life.  All right, all right.  I'll try to help you find that prince.  Boy.  What a soft-shell I'm turning out to be. Scuttle: Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see. 
(Cut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.)

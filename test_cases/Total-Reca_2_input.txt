BENNIE If that means I know it all, you're right, boss. 
QUAIL What do you know about the Sphinx? 
BENNIE I don't know nothin'.  Not about the Sphinx.  That's out of the ball park. 
QUAIL I have to get there.  Can't you help me? 
BENNIE No can do, mon.  You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water... Bennie's your man. But the Sphinx... that's E.I.O. -- 
80A     INT. CITY UNDER THE DOME - NIGHT 
The solar car is moving through the crowd, when suddenly SIRENS approach on a cross street.  Bennie brakes and stops. He and Quail watch as POLICE MOTORCYCLES clear a path for a huge, GAS-POWERED LIMO.  MINERS on the sidewalks shout CURSES, OBSCENITIES -- 
BENNIE Well... look at that one, eh? 
QUAIL What? 
BENNIE Big cheese in town.  Big smelly cheese. 
QUAIL Cohaagen?  But isn't he often here? 
BENNIE No way.  That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must be cookin'. 
Quail keeps his face in shadow and watches Cohaagen with curiosity as he passes.  Cohaagen is lit up briefly by a street lamp.  His face makes an impression on Quail, who perhaps faintly remembers him in the past. 
82      INT. QUAIL'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door.  He checks all the rooms.  Then he crosses to the dresser, studies himself in the mirror.  He looks haggard. 
Quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets it on top and opens it.  He removes a shoulder holster and pistol, sets them aside.  He takes out a tape recorder. 
He sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions. He's just about to activate it, when he hears a KNOCK at the door. 
Quail freezes.  Another KNOCK. 
VOICE (O.S.) (through door) Mr. Hauser... 
QUAIL Who is it? 
VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you... about Douglas Quail. 
Quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into the drawer -- everything except the PISTOL. 
Quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side -- out of the line of fire). 
QUAIL (tensely) Who are you? 
VOICE (O.S.) My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall, Incorporated. 
QUAIL (stunned; incredulous) Rekall?? 
VOICE (O.S.) Yes.  It's difficult to explain... Could you open the door, please?  I'm not armed. 
Quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out of view of the person at the door. 
A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit. 
EDGEMAR Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come in?  I won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me. 
He can't see the gun, but somehow knows.

BERLIN Lotta scratch-marks on your door? 
HELENA Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something? 
ROSS Could I just refer you to this memo here, Sergeant? 
He tries to get his notebook under BERLIN's nose.  But BERLIN isn't looking or listening but following HELENA into her hall. 
BERLIN Did Amber have a dog? 
HELENA Yes. 
BERLIN What color was it? 
HELENA I don't know. 
She opens the door and ROSS is barely through before it slams. 
34:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY. 
ROSS baits BERLIN up the corridor. Ridicules in silence while counting imaginary winnings. Watch my lips! F.I.F.T.Y. HELENA walks innocent of the pantomime and BERLIN tries to ignore it. 
BERLIN .. if she writes, or calls, or any- thing at all, you let me know, O.K. 
He bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge ROSS's bullshit. 
I'll leave a number with the office .. 
Lips drill a whisper into his ear. "Fifty fucken dollars, O.K." 
What exactly do you teach, Helena? 
HELENA Music composition .. and cello .. 
ROSS Fifty of em. And I want em now. 
Meanwhile the elevator arrives triggering a Voice. "YOU ARE NOW ON THE FOURTH FLOOR." Doors slide open and Christ look at this? What kind of eye-defect needs glasses like this? Lenses like ei- ther half of a glass ball.  He's early 30's and decidedly "iffy." Is he student/staff or what? As he exits they enter staring aft- er him. As the doors close the MYOPIC turns to stare after them. 
35:  INT.  CHEVROLET.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DUSK. 
ROSS drives and BERLIN studies Amber's file. "Wanna beer?" No answer but cans appear anyway from a pack between Ross's legs. 
BERLIN Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something .. 
ROSS No, you didn't. 
BERLIN Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .. 
ROSS No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll. 
BERLIN We're going. 
ROSS Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime. 
ROSS pops cans and hands one over. But BERLIN doesn't want it. 
BERLIN Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky .. 
ROSS So am I. But where's my money? 
BERLIN Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it .. 
ROSS Pay me, and I shut up. 
BERLIN I haven't got it. 
ROSS Then give me that Zippo. 
BERLIN Why? 
ROSS I need some security. I don't trust you anymore. 
BERLIN I had one puff on a pipe. 
ROSS I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash." 
Snaps fingers "Gimme the lighter." And he does to shut him up. 
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna do you a big favor .. Forget the 50 and I'll keep this. 
BERLIN What do you want it for? 
ROSS To throw out of the window. 
Does it as he says it. Bye-bye Zippo! BERLIN can't believe it. 
BERLIN What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! .. 
ROSS It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs? 
BERLIN I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.

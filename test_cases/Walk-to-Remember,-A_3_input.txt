Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an instant. 
Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER. 
EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER 
A battered Chevette steers through a working-class neighborhood. 
INT. CHEVETTE 
Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat. 
CYNTHIA What if they expel you? 
LANDON Kelly wouldn't do that. 
CYNTHIA Why not? 
LANDON Cuz nothing happened at school. 
He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile. 
CYNTHIA Don't smile at me. It's not going to get you out of this. 
LANDON Why not?   It always has before. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM) 
By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM 
Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't. His forehead still shows a bruise. 
MR. KELLY I had hopes for you. 
LANDON Like I'd grow up to be president, another Reagan. 
MR. KELLY (not laughing) Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average. 
LANDON I'm no dummy. 
MR. KELLY That's right.    You just act like one. 
On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the Camaro. 
LANDON Those aren't mine. 
MR.KELLY They came from your car. 
LANDON I wasn't the one drinking. 
Kelly holds up the police test finding. 
MR. KELLY Your blood alcohol level. Maybe you were legally in the clear, but I make the rules here. 
Landon scowls, knows he's defeated. 
LANDON You expelling me? 
MR. KELLY I am. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Now I can do what I want. 
MR. KELLY That's right. (sarcastic) The world is your oyster. 
EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER 
Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the courtyard. Not a care in the world. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER 
Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on his way to school. 
EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER 
Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath, the body, the paint. A discouraging mess. 
INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 
Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door. 
LANDON Mom.   I need a ride. 
INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM 
Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform hangs over a chair. 
CYNTHIA (sleepy, annoyed) I'm not getting up to drive you somewhere. (beat) What're you doing home? 
EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Landon lifts the garage DOOR. 
LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE 
A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike. 
EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER 
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop. A bus approaching.

The unmanned SEARCHLIGHT scans the yard, casting intermittent shadows. 
SCAR 
This place is important. The men here wouldn't just walk out. 
FOXY 
Maybe they had no choice. FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet curtain, past which nothing can be seen. 
FOXY (CONT'D) 
There could be stenches in there. (Readying his M-16) Got a flashlight? 
Scar nervously pulls out a flashlight. As he CLICKS on the BEAM, he loses his grip. The flashlight drops to the ground. Scar reaches for it. His fingers tip it and it spins. The beam WASHES across his shoes. Then Foxy's shoes. Then finds... ...ONE OTHER SHOE. Someone else's. Gasping, Scar grabs the flashlight, shining the beam up onto what should be a leg, but there's nothing left above its bloody shin. PLIP! PLOP! PLIP! Beads of BLOOD hit the floor, dropping from the DARK FIGURE of a SOLDIER who is approaching. Scar aims the flashlight at the figure's face, recognizing... 
SCAR 
Brubaker! You okay? Where's the other guys? What happened here? 
Brubaker keeps coming. He has BULLET HOLES in his chest, but they're not what's dripping blood. It's another half-eaten FOOT that he's carrying. BRUBAKER IS DEAD. Foxy shoots him. Foxy and Scar move into a hangar-like space. Pitch black. Except for the mote-filled BEAM from Scar's flashlight, which 
illuminates a supply of enormous cannon shells, lined up on storage shelves. THE "JOHNSONS". SIX DEAD SOLDIERS are hunkered in the shadows, EATING the REMAINS of OTHER DEAD SOLDIERS. 
Foxy grimly raises his weapon. As he squeezes the trigger, the sound of the gunfire OVERLAPS into... 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
ANCHOR and SCAR wrestle TWO "JOHNSONS" into place. 
CHOLO 
That's good. That's all we need. 
FOXY 
(Sober) To blow up the Green. 
INT./EXT. T-BIRD - HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT 
THE T-BIRD rumbles along a road lined with large HOMES, once prized for their panoramic views. RILEY'S "Game Boy" BEEPS. The display shows the RED DOT moving along a MAP. 
RILEY 
Cholo's moving out. Looks like he's heading right for us. 
T 
S 
Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
hit. Off this hillside...they can shell the Green. Pull in! There! 
SLACK pulls into a driveway, stopping the T-Bird in the shadow of one of the houses. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
hey'll be coming up this road. 
INT. BANK - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT 
In a walk-in STEEL-WALLED SAFE, KAUFMAN pulls out banded STACKS OF MONEY and stuffs them into TWO PRADA DUFFELS. 
EXT. BOAT RAMP - NIGHT 
ONE HEAD RISES out of the river. It's BIG DADDY, rivulets of 
water running down the creases of his face. Another head rises. And another. NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER ZOMBIE. More and more heads break the surface. The water FILLS with BODIES emerging from the deep. HUNDREDS OF THEM. The CITY LIGHTS REFLECT off their wet clothes as the ARMY OF THE DEAD 
clambers up a boat ramp on the city side of the river. 
EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 
RILEY and HIS TEAM wait in the shadows of the driveway they pulled into. They HEAR the distant GROWL of DEAD RECKONING. 
Looking over a hedge-row, Riley can see HIGH BEAMS advancing. 
RILEY 
(To the Others) Y'all stay here. 
SLACK 
You're goin' out there alone? You need our guns. 
RILEY 
Dead Reckoning's got steel skin an inch thick. You can't shoot your way in. I'm hopin' I can talk my way in. 
MANOLETE 
He's gonna steal the truck and leave us here.

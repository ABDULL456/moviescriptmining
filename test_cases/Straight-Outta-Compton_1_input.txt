Cop raises the glass. 
DRE (CONT'D) Really, ok... 
SUGE (laughing) Who fuckin' shit up! You trippin. We can do anything we want to do. We started this shit. This is us. 
DRE Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us. (pointing around) This other shit -- is you! 
Suge's Goons get in position. 
GOON #1 Better watch ya mouth, Blood. 
DRE 'Tha fuck you talking too? 
GOON #2 (dismissive) Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer around here. 
DRE What the fuck?!!! 
This sends Dre into orbit. He goes after Blood #1. The whole conference room jumps in between them -- keeping these two human pit bulls from scrappin'. Everybody jumps but Suge who amused by the whole thing -- puffs on his cigar. Dre is being held back by the Off Duties. While Goon #1 is being held back by Goon #2 and a few others. World War III averted for now. 
DRE (CONT'D) Get the fuck off me. 
Dre breaks free and storms out. 
SUGE Man don't even trip off this muthafucka. What he going to do? Where he going to go? 
113pt2 TESTAROSA                                             113pt2 
And just sits there, seething. Reaches in the back seat, grabs a bottle of Hennessey. Takes a swig... Then -- 
A sudden look of determination washes over him. He TEARS out into the street, tires SQUEALING -- ERRRR! 
PASSING CARS, swerving, Dre punches the gas, RPMs maxed out. Shifts, flying through an intersection -- the needle passes 100mph. Keeps going, loving the release, the control... 
A POLICE CRUISER, coming the opposite direction, spots Dre's Testarosa -- In a flash, they bang a U-turn, peeling so fast, smoke clouds the night air -- 
ON DRE, distant police lights now strobing off of his face from the rear view mirror. Fuck! Thinking fast, he switches off his headlights. Hits the gas, needle bottoming-out! 
As he reaches the next intersection, Dre makes a hard left -- SCREECHES to a stop, tucking into a spot along the side of the road. Shuts off his car. Waits, breathing fast, as -- 
DRE (TO HIMSELF) Come on, come on, come -- 
THE POLICE CRUISER barrels around the corner -- SLAMS THE BRAKES! Two LAPD OFFICERS fling open their doors, guns leveled at Dre's car! 
Eyes wide, adrenaline coursing through his veins, chest heaving, Dre grits his teeth. He's stuck... and he knows it. 
LAPD OFFICER 1 (VIA LOUDSPEAKER) Driver! Put your hands out of your window where we can see them! Now! 
Dre complies, reaches his hands out of his window. 
The two officers carefully approach, guns at the ready. OFFICER 2 slaps the cuffs on Dre, regret immediately registering on his face as we -- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
114   EXT. JAIL - PASADENA - ESTABLISHING - DAY                   114 
Nicole hops out of her car and hurries into -- 
115   INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY                             115 
Dre and NICOLE sit across from each other, Plexiglas between them, talking via phone receivers. 
NICOLE Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row? 
DRE Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway. 
She surveys him, pain in his eyes. 
NICOLE 112 days? That doesn't even make sense. 
DRE Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation. 
They sit there, just being in the awkward, contrived moment. 
NICOLE You got one phone call and you called me? 
DRE `Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care. 
She looks at him, nods, dabs at her wet eyes. 
DRE (CONT'D) I fucked up. But I've had a lot of time to think in here, and I promise you, things are gonna be different from now on. 
That lies there a minute. Then -- 
NICOLE You take care of yourself, Andre. 
She stands, heads away... And we see the reflexive disappointment on Dre's face before... 
116   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 116 
Tomica and Eazy lie in bed together. He stares at the ceiling, and she runs her hand soothingly down his arm. 
EAZY I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going. 
Tomica props herself up on her elbow, looks at him. 
TOMICA I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you. 
Eazy puts his arm around her, pulls her close. They both lie there a little longer, just breathing. 
EAZY Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way. 
Tomica nods, smiles. Encouraged he has a plan again.

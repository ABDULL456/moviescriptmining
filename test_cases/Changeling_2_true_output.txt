YBARRA It's all right, I'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he? 
ADMINISTRATOR Room seven. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
A single table, two chairs. Sanford sits quietly, nervously, as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   67. 
YBARRA It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it. 
He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette. Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out. 
YBARRA Well? 
SANFORD Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay? 
YBARRA Nothing is. 
A long BEAT.   Sanford composes himself, begins: 
SANFORD My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He owns the ranch where you found me. He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that. Said I could stay on as long as I wanted to. I figured that also meant I could leave whenever I wanted to, but he wouldn't let me. 
YBARRA Are you saying he held you prisoner? (sanford nods) Bull. When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird. Could've left any time you wanted. So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally? 
SANFORD No...no, it's nothing like that. 
YBARRA Because I don't have time for -- 
SANFORD Listen to me, please.    He said -- 
YBARRA What?   What did he -- 
SANFORD He said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me! (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                        68. 
SANFORD (Cont'd) You don't understand, you don't know what he's like, what he...what we did...what he made me do. 
Sanford is in tears by now. Ybarra realizes that there's something real going on here, and backs off. 
YBARRA Okay, lets start at the beginning. What did he make you do? 
Sanford closes his eyes.    Takes a long beat.   Finally.... 
SANFORD Him and me...me and Gordon, we... (beat, softly) ...we killed some kids. 
Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand. 
SANFORD I didn't mean to, I swear...he made me help him, said if I didn't he'd kill me, too. Please, you gotta help me...I'm scared...I don't want to go to Hell for killing kids. 
YBARRA What kids? 
SANFORD I don't know...I never knew their names. 
YBARRA How many kids? SANFORD All together? 
He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next. 
SANFORD About...twenty, I guess. 
YBARRA You're lying. 
SANFORD No, it's true, I swear! 
YBARRA Twenty kids. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                    69. 
SANFORD Yeah...thereabouts...I kinda stopped counting after a while, and Gordon said one or two might've gotten away, but -- 
YBARRA Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids -- 
SANFORD We did...yeah, we did that.... 
YBARRA How? 
Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly.... 
SANFORD Most times we'd bring back just one or two...sometimes as many as three. 
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - DAY 
Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking the engine as Sanford looks on nervously. 
SANFORD (V.O.) I always knew when he was getting ready 'cause he'd go through the car and clean it up, make sure the tires were good, the engine...he was always afraid something'd break down and we'd be caught. 
Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford.    Smiles. 
GORDON Time to go. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
A kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself, as the truck starts to approach from behind.

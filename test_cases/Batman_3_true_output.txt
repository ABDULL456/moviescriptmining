We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS. 
ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered up alongside him. 
ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it quickly in his coat. 
JACK You didn't show up. 
ECKHARDT We had another bat sighting. 
JACK I'm sure that was vitally important. Listen: things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent. 
ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two. 
ECKHARDT I'm doing the best I can. If it's a problem -- 
JACK Eckhardt... our problems are your problems. 
ECKHARDT I'll work on it. 
JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the material between his fingers. 
JACK Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think? 
ECKHARDT (knocking his hands away) I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. 
JACK You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future. 
ECKHARDT laughs in his face. 
ECKHARDT Ambition. (nodding his head) Forget it, Jack. You'll never run that organization. 
JACK And why's that? 
ECKHARDT You're a psycho, friend. You're an A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows it. 
JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK. 
JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant. 
By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun. 
JACK Here. Use mine. 
JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement. 
ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun. 
JACK (cont.) It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt here is a good cop. A real good cop. (pause; smiling) Inexpensive. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY 
Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table. 
KNOX What have you got for me, Jerry? 
JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in approval. 
KNOX (cont.) Nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh? 
He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out: 
COLLEAGUE Hey Knox, you got a visitor. 
KNOX I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him, okay? 
COLLEAGUE This one you might want to dust yourself. 
Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, her face obscured by a big outrageous hat. 
KNOX ... Vicki Vale. 
The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs. 
VICKI How'd you know it was me? 
KNOX Honey -- I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. (grinning) If I had a good enough hint. 
He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him. 
KNOX (cont.) Where the hell have you been? 
VICKI A nice, restful vacation. 
She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed. 
KNOX God, a girl could get hurt doing this. 
VICKI I do get hurt. 
She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then points to the scar and adds, slyly: 
KNOX Got any more of those?

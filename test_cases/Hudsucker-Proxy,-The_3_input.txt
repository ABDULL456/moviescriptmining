No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD. 
With a STINGING CHORD we -- 
CUT TO: 
CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958) 
Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS. 
After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man: 
NARRATOR (V.O.) The's right... New York. 
We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING. 
We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers slip by left and right. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' minutes it is. Come midnight it's gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother feelin'. The New Year. The future... 
The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is "Auld Lang Syne." 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to start one mo' trip 'round the sun, an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' gay... 
We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top is a large illuminated clock. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Yep... 
We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...All over town champagne corks is a-poppin'. 
A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots is dancin' to the strains of Guy Lombardo... Down in Times Square the little folks is a-watchin' and a- waitin' fo' that big ball to drop... 
The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!" 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...They all tryin' to catch holt a one moment of time... 
The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW." 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! This is it! I got it!' 'Course by then it'll be past. (more cheerfully) But they all happy, evvybody havin' a good time. 
We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the clock. The window starts to open. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there... 
A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge. With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out with greater volume. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...This one's Norville Barnes. 
The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now." 
He looks with nervous determination into the void. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Let's move in for a closer look. 
The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...That office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of Hudsucker Industries. It's his office... 
Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows louder and the WIND blows in his face. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...How'd he get so high? An' why is he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna do it -- is Norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk? 
Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME. 
We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL THRUM becomes very loud indeed. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...Well the future, that's something you can't never tell about... 
The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!" 
NARRATOR (V.O.) ...But the past... That's another story... 
OVER BLACK 
The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and GRINDING GEARS as we... 
CUT TO: 
DESTINATION DISPLAY 
On the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display says "MUNCIE-NEW YORK." 
LINE OF BAGS 
is being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.: 
It has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. 
After a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up.

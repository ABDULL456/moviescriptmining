He walks back. Marco unlocks the door. Stanley and Holly look at each other. Holly starts to cry. 
STANLEY It's okay.    I love you, baby. 
Marco stares at Stanley as they walk out. 
MARCO See ya around. 
STANLEY I doubt it. 
He starts to walk out... 
CYPHER MERC #3 Sir, the money just disappeared. 
GABRIEL What? 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              121 
CYPHER MERC #3 The money, it's gone. 
Gabriel turns around to look at Stanley.    We ZOOM INTO a CLOSEUP. He's pissed. 
GABRIEL What do you mean, gone? 
WIDER 
We see Stanley. He looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. 
STANLEY Shit!   Run, Holly! 
GABRIEL Get her! 
Marco pulls his assault rifle but Stanley waylays him. They both hit the ground. 
122   EXT. BANK - DAY                                                122 
Holly hauls ass into the street. Once the FBI SWAT guys see she is off the sidewalk, they scoop her up. 
123   INT. BANK                                                      123 
Gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against Stan's head as he and Marco roll around on the ground. 
STANLEY Won't do you any good. The money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years. 'Course it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours. The power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. But, you kill me and you never get a single dollar. 
Gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of RPMs.

STANLEY You let the hostages go and then I'll tell you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I can't break through the fire wall. It's my act of God policy. (beat) Deal? 
GABRIEL I'm thinking. 
A very tense moment passes.      Gabriel looks around.   He has an idea. 
GABRIEL Tell ya what.    No deal. 
Marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30- foot-high ceiling buttresses. 
Gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. 
GABRIEL Marco!   Grab Agent Sculley! 
Marco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable. 
STANLEY No, don't do this. 
Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her fingers. 
Two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. 
Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.

123   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               123 
GABRIEL In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known. 
STANLEY (freaking) What are you doing? Stop! 
GABRIEL String up the D.E.A. bitch. 
Marco hits the power switch. Ginger is yanked up into the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor. 
STANLEY Just let her down. I'll do whatever you want.

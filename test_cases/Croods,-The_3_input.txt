Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant. 
Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto Eep's path. 
EEP You dropped these. 
Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at Eep. 
They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again. 
Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He grumbles and enters a different tunnel. 
ON THE MAZE EXIT - 
Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep. 
Guy takes her hand. GUY Come with me. 
Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch. 
THUNK Here boy, catch! 
A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival. There is an obvious change in the ladies. 
THUNK (CONT'D) Gran? 
Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look. 
EEP Mom? 
BELT (APPROVING) Raaah raaah. 
A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two others. 
UGGA Grug? 
Grug lets out another blow on his horn. 
UGGA (CONT'D) I'll go get him. 
ON GRUG still stuck in the maze. He holds his head in defeat, and TOSSES the shell down. 
TRUCK-IN on Grug. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 1175 - UNDER THE STARS 
PAN UP a giant redwood tree. The Croods are gathered in a cozy crook of the tree. 
Belt mixes drinks while Gran relaxes in a hammock. Thunk is playing with his new pet. 
THUNK Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over. 
Douglas ROLLS OVER, right OFF the tree. 
THUNK (CONT'D) Good boy Douglas! 
Belt POURS a drink for Gran. Sandy takes Gran her drink as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes. 
GRAN I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced. (MORE) GRAN (CONT'D) Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather. 
SANDY/THUNK/EEP Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
BELT Ha ha ha ha. 
PAN DOWN TO TREE BASE 
Ugga and Grug approach. They hear the LAUGHING coming from high above. Grug peers up and sees the SWINGING HAMMOCKS, torch lights. 
GRUG (PANIC) Croods! Come get down here!

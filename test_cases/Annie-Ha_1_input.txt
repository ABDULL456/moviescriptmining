They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings. 
ALLISON (Overlapping) Yes. 
ALVY (Overlapping) -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too.  How much can they laugh? (Off screen) They-they they're laughed out. 
ALLISON (Off screen) Do you feel all right? 
As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in clusters around the room. 
The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging his hands nervously. 
COMEDIAN (Off screen, onstage) You know ... 
Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about. 
ALVY (Above the chatter around him) Look, what's your-what's your name? 
COMEDIAN (Off screen) ... General Eisenhower is not ... 
ALLISON (Looking out at the stage) Allison. 
ALVY Yeah?  Allison what? 
ALLISON (Still looking off screen) Portchnik. 
COMEDIAN ... a group from the ... 
ALVY (Coughing) Thank you. I-I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... (He clears his throat) Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political comedian at all. 
The audience starts to laugh. 
ALVY I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the Eisenhower Administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years. 
The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage. 
INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM. 
Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him. 
ALVY H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me! 
ALLISON Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need your attention. 
Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands. 
ALVY It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.  So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once?  It doesn't make sense. 
ALLISON Alvy. 
Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his fingers and starts walking again. 
ALVY I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range.  But ... (Clears his throat) if there was a second assassin ... it- That's it! 
Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf. 
ALLISON We've been through this. 
ALVY If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle. 
ALLISON (Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette) Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right? 
ALVY Well, why not? 
ALLISON Yeah, Earl Warren? 
ALVY (Moving toward the bed) Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren. 
ALLISON Lyndon Johnson? 
ALVY (Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing) L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician.  You know the ethics those guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester. 
ALLISON Then everybody's in in the conspiracy? 
ALVY (Nodding his head) Tsch. 
ALLISON The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House? 
Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again. 
ALVY I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room attendant. 
ALLISON You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. 
ALVY Oh, my God! (Then, to the camera) She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She was willing.  She was real ... intelligent. (Sighing) Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN. The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed. Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is: RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi Master of the game. Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the screen. 
RYAN You recording this? 
CHAD (OS) Yeah, sure... CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone. Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes on the shoulder. 
RYAN Move, bitch. He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD." Nearby, a KID watching the game nods. 
KID Nice. The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score. 
RYAN Get that? Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it. 
CHAD Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum Monster in Hi-Def videostream- 
RYAN C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that. Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND". 
CHAD (through cup-holding teeth) Sweet. It's going to my email right now. S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad wipes it dry on his pants. 
RYAN Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in seven days. 
CHAD They aren't giving you shit yet? 
RYAN Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else. Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over. 
CUT TO: 
THE OCEAN As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in, but it's still a forty foot drop. 
RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal. 
CHAD Go already. No one's looking. His left hand holds his WALLET. 
CHAD (CONT'D) (re: wallet) Need me to hold that? Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly. 
RYAN Waterproof. But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left leg starts trembling like crazy. 
RYAN (CONT'D) This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick another dare. Chad lowers the phone, irritated. 
CHAD My ass. Not after you made me march in the Gay Pride Parade wearing a thong. 
RYAN Screw it then. In one... Two... Two and a half-- 
CHAD Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot. Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to the deck. 
CHAD (CONT'D) Just so you know, I'm emailing this to every chick you ever met. But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are glued to something else-- 
CHAD (CONT'D) (speaking like HAL 900) Transmitting pussy file now. CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the "Heal The Bay" rally. Ryan walks over like he owns the place. 
RYAN Got any more? I'm here to help. 
CHLOE Thanks, but no, we got 'em all. 
RYAN What's in 'em? Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Cool, you're handing these out during the concert? 
CHLOE Yeah, wanna help? Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart. 
RYAN Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the Bay. " His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course... An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now. 
RYAN (CONT'D) We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade... I'm surprised I haven't seen you. He offers his hand. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Ryan. She takes it.

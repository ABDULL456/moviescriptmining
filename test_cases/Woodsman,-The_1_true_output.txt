WALTER (sleepy) Hi.

Walter pulls away. 
WALTER Why do you want to know? 
VICKI Because I like you. 
Walter is silent. 
VICKI (cont'd) I won't run away. 
here's a long pause. He rests back down against the pillows. 
WALTER What's the worst thing you ever did? 
VICKI The worst? 
WALTER Yeah. 
Vicki looks at him. 
VICKI Fucked my best friend's husband. 
Walter listens with no reaction. 
VICKI (cont'd) I mean my best friend since the second grade. Her husband was hot for me and, god, he was cute. She was an international flight attendant, so we would get it on for days, while she was off in some country we couldn't pronounce. Then he told her, the shit. It broke up our friendship, broke up their marriage. Later she had a nervous breakdown, quit her job, then moved in with her sister who she despised.

VICKI (cont'd) I still feel like the lowest piece of shit, when I think about it. 
She looks at Walter. He says nothing, his expression blank.

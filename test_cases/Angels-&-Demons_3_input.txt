VITTORIA (CONTINUING) -- canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night.     The intruder killed my research partner, Leonardo Bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security. 
They look at her, don't quite see the connection. 
VITTORIA (cont'd) We use retinal scanners. (they still don't get it) They cut out his eyes. 
They cringe. 
VITTORIA (cont'd) That canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter.    We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City. 
ROCHER I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra.    I haven't heard of antimatter. 
VITTORIA It's new, energy research technology. It uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti-matter positrons generated in particle accelerations in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 
They look at her blankly.    She points at the screen, 
VITTORIA (cont'd) The anti-matter is suspended, there, in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets at each end. But if it were to fall out of suspension and come into contact with matter -- say, the bottom of the canister -- the two opposing forces will annihilate one another. Violently. 
ROCHER And what might cause it to fall out of suspension? 
VITTORIA The battery going dead.     Which it will. (looks at the screen) In six hours and eleven minutes. 
Silence for a moment. 
VITTORIA (cont'd) Where is that camera?   Number eighty- six? 
OLIVETTI It's wireless.     It too was stolen. That could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls. 
VITTORIA You've got to find it. 
ROCHER We're a bit preoccupied with four missing cardinals at the moment. 
VITTORIA You don't understand.    An annihilation is a cataclysmic event. It would be a blinding explosion, equivalent to about five megatons. The blast radius alone would be -- 
Softly, Langdon speaks up from behind her. 
LANGDON "Vatican City will be consumed by light." 
A few voices fall still.   They turn and look at him. 
ROCHER Those are the exact words the kidnapper used. 
INT     ROCHER'S OFFICE       DAY 
A few moments later, they're crowded around the communications console at Rocher's desk, where a dimly-lit video recording is playing back on a computer screen.    (The office is behind a glass wall to one side of the headquarters.) 
The images on the recording are of FOUR OLDER MEN, some in their sixties, the others in their seventies, filmed in dim light behind bars in a dank, dungeon-like space. 
A lightly accented VOICE speaks from behind the camera. 
VOICE (O.S.) We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... and then bring your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light. 
LANGDON It's an ancient llluminati threat. (Rocher pauses the recording) The destruction of Vatican City through light.     The four pillars -- he probably means the kidnapped cardinals.     You didn't mention they were the preferiti. (to Vittoria) The favorites to be chosen as the new Pope.     Play it again. 
VOICE (O.S.) We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... 
LANGDON Stop it there. 
Rocher does 
LANGDON (cont'd) "Brand" them, another llluminati legend, this one says there are a set of five brands, each one an ambigram. (MORE) 
LANGDON (cont'd) The first four are the fundamental elements of science -- earth, air, fire, water.    The fifth -- is a mystery.    Maybe it's this. 
He pulls the "llluminati" ambigram from his pocket. 
ROCHER He said they'd be killed publicly. In churches. 
LANGDON (nods, not surprised) Revenge for La Purga. 
ROCHER La Purga? 
LANGDON Don't you guys read your own history? 1668.     The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross.     To "purge their sins." Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters.     It was after La Purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged.     This sounds like retribution. (to Rocher) Is there any more? 
Rocher hits play again. 
VOICE (O.S.) .... and then bring your church down upon you.    Vatican City will be consumed by light... 
While listening this time, Langdon notices a darkened video monitor, inlaid at an angle on Rocher's desk.    It faces away from the outer office, and instead of an on/off switch, there is an oddly-shaped keyhole. 
VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd) A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination. 
Langdon looks up sharply. 
LANGDON The Path of Illumination? 
Rocher stops the video. 
LANGDON (cont'd) I need to get into the Vatican Archives. 
Rocher shakes his head, looks at Olivetti harshly, is embarrassed. 
OLIVETTI Professor, this is not the appropriate moment to- 
ROCHER Your petition has been denied seven times, Mr. Langdon. 
LANGDON This has nothing to do with that, (FAST) The Path of Illumination is an ancient trail through Rome that leads to the Church of the Illumination, a secret place where llluminati members could meet in safety.    If I can find the Segno, the sign that marks the start of the Path, I'm willing to bet the four churches along it are where he intends to murder your cardinals. If we can get to one of them before he does, we can stop it.    But to find the start of the path, I need to get into the Archives. 
ROCHER Even if I wanted to help you, access is only by written decree of the curator and the Board of Vatican Librarians. 
LANGDON Or by papal mandate. 
ROCHER Yes.    But as you've no doubt heard, the Holy Father is-

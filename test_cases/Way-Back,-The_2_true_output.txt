A30 CONTINUED: A30 
SMITH Yes, but lose 200 men and you'll have some forms to fill out. Could go badly for you. The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on the freezing ground. All but SMITH. 
SMITH (CONT'D) We could move into the forest, find shelter! 
GUARD NO. 1 Lie down! The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol. On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the unfolding drama. GUARD NO. 1 shouts for SMITH to return, others raise their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to lower their weapons. 
GUARD NO. 1 (CONT'D) Let the prisoners take shelter in the trees! Shoot anyone who makes a run for it! JANUSZ stares after SMITH, admiring of his reckless courage. 
AB30 FOREST, LATER - DAY AB30 The men work frantically collecting fallen timber. SMITH watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising the building of their shelter. Most of the other prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a team under his direction.

AB30 CONTINUED: AB30 Some distance away VALKA huddles alone against the trunk of a tree. He too, is watching JANUSZ organize shelter for the group. 
AC30 LATER STILL. 
AC30 JANUSZ calls KHABAROV to join them, but he declines politely. He moves on to find SMITH - invites him back to their improvised shelter. As SMITH sits, ZORAN offers his hand. 
ZORAN You are brave man - Dragan Zoran, Yugoslav this is Janusz Wieszczek the youngster is Kazik, both Polish. (They nod to SMITH) 
VOSS Andrejs Voss, Latvian. 
ZORAN (It's a League of Nations.) English our common language! SMITH nods. 
JANUSZ And you're ? 
SMITH Smith. 
JANUSZ Your first name? 
SMITH Mister. 
JANUSZ Mister Smith? 
SMITH That's right. As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews on the bark. The others follow his example. Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He takes note of the group as future troublemakers. 
AD30 INT. BARRACKS - DAWN AD30 
The men are stirring, struggling up to face another day, when the door opens, and in a flurry of snow, GUARD NO. 1 enters with another soldier. He orders SMITH, JANUSZ and his group to fall out. As he passes SMITH - 
GUARD NO. 1 
(IN RUSSIAN) You don't like being out in the cold, do you Cowboy? And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ. 
SMITH Might as well have shot us yesterday. JANUSZ and the others look at him. 
SMITH (CONT'D) We're for the mine. 
30 INT. MINE - DAY 30 
A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the most time in this frozen hell. The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks, the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately, fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia. Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead. 
31 INT. DEEPER IN THE MINE - DAY 31 
KAZIK and a man known as 'THE PROF', drag a cart laden with rock up a steep incline. They wear horse collars attached to the cart by leather harnesses. 
(CC)NTTNTTFT)1 
31 CONTINUED: 31 THE PROF's wasted frame and sallow complexion are in contrast to his lively intelligent eyes. He says something to KAZIK in Russian. He shakes his head. He doesn't speak Russian. THE PROF tries German, then English. 
KAZIK English, yes. They share a smile. 
PROF I was only saying, these collars - the same used by ancient Egyptian people.

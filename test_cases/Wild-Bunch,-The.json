{"train": "THE WILD BUNCH \nWritten by \nWalon Green & Sam Peckinpah \nFebruary 12th, 1968 \nFADE IN: \nOUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL) \nA TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back part of a sign. \nNARRATOR To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is big\u00e2\u0080\u009e good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and \nCONTINUED \n2 CONTINUED sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). \" He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order. \n4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed: \nW\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdLCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL \nTHE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS \nFOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5 \n1914, POPULATION 2682 \nSTAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _ \nDUTCH Make you feel welcome? \nPIKE \n(DRYLY) It helps.. \nTEC TOR What's it say? \nANGEL (baiting him) It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read. \nCONTINUED \n5 CONTINUED Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike. \nTECTOR I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid. \nANGEL Nor I with dogs. \nDUTCH (grinning at Pike) ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks. \nPIKE (t0 Teotor and Angel) Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON A\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdM BOXCARS into a side street. \nEXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY \nTHE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside. \nSPEAKER (OS) Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. \nCONTINUED \nCONTINUED \nSPEAKER (OS) (CONTID) \n(THEN) That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.- \nCONGREGATION (OS) I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same. \nAS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS, ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback. \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS, \nBUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME. \n10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE \nSALOON. AT T\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them. 1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square. Some passersby look curiously. \nPAYMASTER (reaching for air) What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip!) \nPIKE If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at: \n27 THE TERRIFIED PAYMASTER, HIS TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET, A HATCHET-FACED HARRIDAN IN HER FIFTIES i,iho enters the office carrying. a.wrapped package and is instantly shoved into. a corner with the other prisoners. 28 ON THE STREET -- THE W.C.T.U. BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces. \n29 ON THE ROOF TOP -- HARRIGAN AND THORNTON NERVOUSLY WATCH THE \nBAND.. THE OTHER MEN EQUALLY TENSE KEEP THEIR RIFLES TRAINED \nON THE DOOR. \nEARRIGAN Damn them! The parade moves toward the saloon. \nTHO RNTO N They should have been told: \nHARRI GAN Told-what!? Sus t how. long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut? Before Thornton can answer: 30 T..C.. SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in his. direction, then freeze as: 31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders. \n32 IN THE PAY OFFICE -- ANGEL CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AS THE NOISE FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi:: 3.3 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE LOADING SACKS OF SILVER into their saddle bags. They are almost ready to. leave. The paymaster, his assistants and the customer, their hands still up, watch C.L. \nMARGARET Trash -- Filthy trash! \nC.L. (gently.) You just. hush now -- \nANGEL People marching and singing coming down the street -- going to pass near the horses. \nCONTINUED \n33 CONTINUED \nC \nPIKE \n(GRINNING) Well, we'll just join in. Angel, turning away, hesitates, looking up through the window \nAT: \n34 SUNLIGHT GLEAMING OFF THE BARREL OF A GUN ON THE ROOF ACROSS \nTHE STREET \nANGEL Rifles -- one -- no three,. maybe more, on the roof. \n35 PIKE QUICKLY CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT. \nPIKE Waiting for us \n(SOFTLY) Son of a bitch He turns and crosses quickly to the back door. Dutch follows. Pike opens it a little, looks ou.t at. \nEXT. REAR OF OFFICE'- DAY \n36 FRA? BUILDINGS AND BARE ADOBE HUTS SURROUNDED BY TRASH AND \nTIN CANS AND AMONG THEM THE INDISTINCT. FIGURES OF RIFLES AND HATS -- they are surrounded. - 37 IN THE OFFICE -- DUTCH JOINS PIKE AT THE DOOR and looks out, then curses softly. \nDUTCH How in hell could they have known we were coming? \nPIKE How in hell do I know? \nDUTCH Where do we go? \n-PIKE Out front -- that's where the horses are.. He shuts the door, crosses toward the paymaster. \nCONTINUED \n37 CONTINTJED \nC.L. We go ing..out back, Mr. Bishop? \nPIKE No, son -- we got company there too -- (as the boy looks at him) -Besides, when I travel, I like my feet to dangle. \nC.L. (indicating the prisoners) I kill 'em-now? \nPIKE (after a moment) No. You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts. \nC.L. 111-1 hold 'am till hell freezes over or you say different ! Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him, hesitates., looks. at C.L., then continues to . the door, grabs the handle, looks back again. \n38 C.L.\"IS CROUCHED IN FRONT OF THE TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET., singing to himself, happy as a clam. 39 DUTCH, ANGEL AND THE OTHERS look at Pike. They are ready. 40 PIKE JERKS OPEN THE DOOR,. KICKS THE terrified paymaster out into the street. \nT. C. \n(QUICKLY) I didn't shoot that old. boy...-My first shot killed this man. right here. \nCOFFER (overlapping, crossing to another body) He's lying'. Him and them others was shootin' that old 'employee' full of holes while I was droppin' this bandit and them others too -- I must've killed all three of 'em, sir, while -- \nCONTINUED \n79- CONTINUED \nTHORNTON (interrupting him as T.C. and the others protest) Harrigan:.. He shot the old an - \n(WEARILY) Maybe we all did. (crossing to him) But by God the next time you plan your massacre a little more carefully ...or I'll begin it with you! \nHARRIGAN \n(FURIOUS) You'll begin a trip back to Yuma Prison if you don't learn to keep your mouth shut l Why - in hell didn't you kill Pike when you had the chance? But Thornton doesn't answer -- he turns, listening to: \nC.L. (OS) \n(SINGING) \"Shall we gather at the river Where bright angels rise and fall Shall we gather at the river When the work's all done next fall?\" \n80 THORNTON AND HARRI GAN WHIRL ,AND RUN FOR THE OFFICE FOLLOWED BY SIMPKINS (the town marshal and trombonist in the W. C.T.U. band), FRAY, his deputy, and the bounty hunters. \n81 IN THE PAYMASTER'S OFFICE -- C.L. IS MARCHING AROUND SINGING, THE . SPRAWLED BODIES OF THE ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET are near the back door.

STAGGERS, falls to one knee,. the shotgun dragging on the floor, his face mirroring shock and surprise. \nC.L.. Well, how'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass. Harrigan fires. C.L. slumps, goes down on the other knee. More bounty hunters burst into the room. \nCHANGE \n83 C.L. LAUGHS, FALLS FLATS ROLLS AND BEGINS TO PUMP THE SHOTGUN and everybody dives for cover and opens fire, riddling him with bullets. 84 BUT HE TAKES THE MARSHAL, the deputy and one bounty hunter with him before he is cut to pieces. 85 HARRIGAN AND THORNTON LOOKING DOWN at the shambles in the room, turn as: \n86 WAINSCOAT, THE MAYOR, ENTER, FOLLOWED BY A GROUP OF SHOCKED AND IRATE TOWNSPEOPLE. BENSON, a beefy redneck rancher, curses bitterly as he crosses to Harrigan. \nBENSON We're holding you -- your whole damned rail- road responsible for this carnage -- \nHARRIGAN Mr. Benson...o \nWAINSCOAT (almost screaming) Innocent people are dead ...women mangled -- dying --because you used our town as a battlefield; You're going to pay, sir -- your-railroad is going to pay for our blood; \nHARRIGAN (blowing up) Without the railroad this place would still be a lousy little pueblo, so don't make any threats to me; \nBENSON (topping him) You can't ambush innocent people. on our street! \nHARRIGAN \n(YELLING) We were preventing a robbery and.attempt- ing to capture a band of outlaws... \nWAINSCOAT \n(LOUDER) You lured that gang in here... the rail- roadts been blabbing about a big silver payload for weeks; \nHARRIGAN We represent the law! \nCHANGE \nMORE IRATE CITIZENS BURST INTO THE OFFICE.

My men will follow -- \nBENSON (OS) (cutting him off) Your men enter this town again and they will be shot on sight; Thornton ignores them, slowly rolling a cigarette, looking after Pike. Harrigan exits, crosses to Thornton. \nHARRIGAN I pulled. you out of jail to get- that bunch -- and you failed -- \nTHORNTON . \n(INTERRUPTING) You gave the ordersl If you want the job done right -- you keep the hell out of it next time - You and the rest of your railroad trash\" I'll do it -- but my way. - - \nHARRIGAN What.makes you think there'll be a next time for you? What makes you think you're not going back behind bars for twenty more years? Thornton's face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners.. \nTHORNTON Because I'm all you've got (then, softly) Because I know him. (turning away bitterly) Because you know I'll get him -- I'll kill him rather than go-back. \nCONTINUED \nEXT.

I only come out here last spring. \nTHORNTON (after a long moment) You can saddle up or shut up -- take your choice -- \nCOFFER (after a long moment) \"What will he do? \nTHORNTON That's what I have to figure. \nCOFFER Maybe they'll split up. \nTHORNTON No -- not 'that. bunch. They'll try again. - - \nT.C. How do you know?' But Thornton doesn't answer. \nEXT. PIKE'S CAMP - NIGHT \n134 PIKE AND DUTCH ARE SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR blankets listening to Angel play the guitar. For several moments they are. silent, then: \nPIKE Didn't you run some kind of mine -- in Sonora? \nDUTCH Yeah, I helped run a little copper -- nothing for us there except day wages, if it was running now -- which it ain't. \nCHANGE \n3L.. 135 PIKE FINDS IT.IMPOSSIBLE TO get comfortable. Groaning and wincing with pain he shifts on the bedroll. \nPIKE Why in the hell, did you ever quit it? \nDUTCH Why in hell are you still goin'? \nPIKE I don.'t know\"any better -- maybe don't want any better, (then, after a moment) Hell, I wouldn't know what to do with 'better' if it poked me.in the eye with a sharp stick. \nDUTCH (laughing softly) You -never gave it :a chance9 Pike. \nPIKE \n(ANGRY) I threw away more chances in one year that you will see in your whole.l.ife -- but that don't mean you have. to ' be a damn fool like me. Dutch sits up, rolls and lights a cigarette. \nDUTCH You got a halfway hard mouth, partner. \nPIKE What in hell do you want me to-say ,-? \nDUTCH Just don't give me, no lectures.. They are silent -- finally: \nPIKE: This was going to be my last, too... I'm not getting around any better -- like the red-haired lady said to the. white-haired judge -- 'I only got so many miles left -in my backside, Your Honor, and I aim to keep it moving while I'm still young enough to feel. what it's there for.' (a.s Dutch -laughs softly) I'd like to make a good score -. then back off. CONTINUED \n135 CONTINUED \nDUTCH Back off to what? (as Pike doesn't answer) Any real ideas for a next one? Pike closes his eyes and leans back. \nPIKE Pershing. has. got men spread over the whole border. Everyone of those garrisons is going to be.gptting payroll. \nDUTCH That kind of information is kind of. rough to come by. \nPIKE (sitting up) Well -- I don't figure it's going to .be easy, but it can be done. \nDUTCH. They'll be waiting for us. \nTECTOR \n(PIOUSLY) 'Pears 'Brother Pike' needs help, Brother Lyle. \nLYLE Riding with 'Brother Pike' and old .man Sykes makes a man wonder if it ain't time to pick up his chips and-find another game. \nTECTOR (suddenly yelling at Pike) How in hell are you going to side any- body if you can't get on a horse. 152 PIKE LOOKS AT THEM, THEN STEPS onto the makeshift stirrup and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g., Dutch swings onto his horse. \nPIKE Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas. He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following. \n153 SYKES RIDES UP BESIDE PIKE \nSYKES That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys 'bout stickin' to- gether.

Coffer pulls up, calls to Thornton: \nCOFFER That culvert -- good place for them ----to make an ambush. \nTHORNTON Go on - ride up and find out. Coffer hesitates, his -ayes wide with fear. Thornton draws his gun, pulls back the hammer. \nTHORNTO1 \n(SAVAGELY) Go onl Coffer rides forward. \nTHORNTON (to the others) Next time I want advice from any of you scum I'll ask for it -- until then, keep . your mouths shut and do what y-ou' re to ld% \nCOFFER (turning back, calling) All clear\"'-- \n155 THORNTON RIDES UP TO THE CULVERTS HALTS, DISMOUN-TS, STEPS INTO the shade, the others follow suit. \nCOFFER From here on, its Mexico, Mr, Thornton. \nT.C.

Coffer instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head. Then, after a moment: \nCOFFER They say Freddy Sykes is with them -- you rode with the old man, didn't you, Mr. Thornton -- you and Pike and the old man? But Thornton rides on and doesn't answer. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANGEL'S VILLAGE - DAY \n159 TECTOR AND LYLE ARE SEATED ON THE GROUND trying to duplicate the intricacies o\u00c2\u00a3 a very complicated cat's cradle demon- strated to them by ROCIO, the lovely bright-eyed 13 year old sister of Angel. Both men are drinking tequilla, but both are sober, entranced and completely dominated by the girl. All three straighten as: 160 CARMEN, ANGEL'S MOTHER, CALLS from a nearby fire where she is preparing food with her mother. \nCARMEN Miha -- trigame auga.por los frijolesl The girl jumps to her feet, hands both men a bucket (or olla) and leads.them down the bank to the river. (The natural beauty of this location should contrast with other landscapes in the picture. This village and its inhabitants represent a complete and green contrast to the arid world of the wild bunch), \nCWGE8 \n161 AN GEL AND PIKE SEATED IN THE THATCHED SHADE OF A RAMADA WITH \nDON JOSE, ANGEL'S GRANDFATHER, WATCH SILENTLY. SYKES IS A FEW FEET AWAY. Angel watches dully,. his eyes mirroring his agony. Pike laughs softly, watching. \nPIKE Hard to believe. \nDON JOSE Not so hard -- we all dream of being a-child again -- even the worst of us -- perhaps the worst most of all.. \nPIKE (looking: at him) You know us, then -- \nDON JOSE I know myself only -- where I have been, what I have done. \nPIKE Like to ride with us, old man? And for a moment, the old man's eyes flash as he watches: 162- DUTCH AND THREEVILLAGERS SHOEING a very small, very mean 16L. mule. All four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling.. \nDON JOSE -- I am too old. (almost cursing, indicating \nSYKES) .Too old even to ride beside this ancient gringo. \n165 SYKES LAUGHS AND DRINKS \nSYKES Hell, you ain't so old; partner. \n166 ANGEL STANDS, TURNS TO THEM \nANGEL \n(BITTERLY) And the soldier. who shot my father what was his name? \nCONTINUED \n166 CONTINUED \nDON JOSE They were many -- who shot -- your father resisted like a man and died like a man -- names in this matter have no importance. (to Pike proudly) I killed one; (as Pike looks at him) I lie -- I ran -- \nSYKES Joe --'by God I like you. I like a man who tells the truth. \nANGEL \n181 HIS GRANDFATHER, WATCHING PIKE AND DUTCH AND CARMALITA, laughing softly to himself, finally turns, his smile fading. \nDON JOSE Why do you wish to know -- for your father - or the whore? Pike looks up as Angel fights within himself to find an answer, \nPIKE \n(FINALLY) It doesn't make any difference, kid our business is in Agua Verde For a moment Angel looks like he will explode, then he lifts a bottle of tequi.lla in salute to Pike. \nANGEL As you say, Jefe - to Agua Verde and 'our business.' \nCUT TO: \nEXT.. AGUA VERDE PLAZA - DAY \n182 PIKE AND THE-OTHER It N ARE WATERING THEIR HORSES under the shade of several large trees in the main plaza of Agua Verde,. The town itself is dull and sun colored like. the surrounding country. Its most remarkable features are a great deal of soldiers exiting and entering a cantina-like building and a small, aging, ornate, church. \n18 3 SYKES PURCHASES A TACO FROM A SMALL BOY and gums at it while the contents run into his beard. 18. PIKE LIFTS A STIRRUP FROM HIS SADDLE on the hitching rail and examines the repair, then puts it on his horse. Tector. and Lyle squat in the shade working at making a cat's cradle. Angel is talking quietly to three Mexican peons some distance away. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2. 185 DUTCH LEAVES. THE BUILDING and joins Pike. \nDUTCH All soldiers - not a bounty hunter in sight. \nPIKE We'll go. have a drink, then try and sell the horses. \nSYKES 'Who'.s going to buy -- looks to me like. this place has been picked clean. \nANGEL (joining Pike) He's been here; 186 THE HORSES PUT THEIR EARS BACK and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene. The men snap their heads.around and look at: \n187 A HUGE CLOUD OF DUST FROM THE EDGE OF T1 014N MOVING DOWN THE STREET towards the plaza. Inside is the almost ghostlike appearance of a 1912 or 1913 touring car. Four mounted men are riding on each side and a host of small.children are running, screaming, behind it. \n188 THE CAR PULLS UP IN FRONT OF THE CANTINA-LIKE BUILDING. \nSIX MEN GET OUT AND TWO OF THEM INSTANTLY BEGIN DUSTING AND POLISHING. The mounted guards. take up positions around the vehicle. The group shows deference to a large man wearing general's braid. -EL 'MAPACHE. Next to him is his second in command, ZAMORRA. The third man dressed in white linen is MOHR, a German military advisor. With him is ERNST, his aide. 189 PIKE AND THE OTHERS WATCH with interest as the men enter a cantina-like building. Then without a word they cross the \nCONTINUED \n189 CONTINUED street, drawn to the vehicle. Angel is tense, knowing that his man has arrived. \nPIKE I seen one just like this in Waco... \nLYLE Run on steam? \nPIKE No...alcohol:...or gasoline. 190 FREDDY SYKES EDGES UP CLOSE TO PIKE. He is anxious to make a. statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car. \nSYKES Pike... .I heard about one they got up north that. kin fly; Pike nods sagely. Te.ctor Gorch on the other side of the car hears the remark. \nTECTOR \n(SCORNFULLY) .That was a balloon ,you damned old fool. \nPIKE No,. the old man's right. They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour...goin' to use them in the war, they say. (as T(ector looks at him astonished) This could cover. 30 miles in an hour -- ' cording to the road, of course. \nDUTCH That could run a horse right into the ground. \nPIKE Not that easy -- these automobiles can't stand.any rough ground -- or hot sun like a horse ---they're for show mostly. 191 TECTOR TOUCHES A FENDER AND ONE of the guards spurs toward him, cursing in Spanish. Tector backs off,. hands in the air. \nTECTOR I was just going to touch th.,e damn thing, not marry it. \nCONTINUED \nCHANGE \n191 CONTINUED \nANGEL Un gigante de miquina -- Ha de tenor una fuerza tremenda. (A giant of a machine -- What force it must have) \nGUARD -La fuerza.do 1,000 caballos. (The force of 1,000 horses.) \nANGEL Y el dueno -- un general por lo menos. (And the owner -- a general at least.) \nGUARD Mapache? Mis que un general - un hombre hecho para reinar todo Mexico, si Dios quiere. (Mapache?

Thought we might sell a few horses. \nMOHR You must have been associated with the American Army, is that riot so? Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the remark. Mapache and Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the conversation. The cantina is silent. \nDUTCH -No -- were not associated with anyone... \nMOHR I see,..1 was curious because of.the equipment which you are carrying.

A soldier rushes him from behind with a machete and the cross fire of his own men kills him as he swings the weapon into TectorPs back. Tector falls to the floor,. writhing in pain, cursing, pulling down a soldier, strangling him as he dies, 500 LYLE STAGGERS, BULLETS PUMPING into him, then falls - dead before he hits the ground.

Glancing at the chart in his hand - SAYER Mrs. Cohen? MRS. COHEN He·s here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means. SAYER I 'm here. (pause) To examine you. MRS. COHEN Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home.

He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13.    OMITTED                                    . v

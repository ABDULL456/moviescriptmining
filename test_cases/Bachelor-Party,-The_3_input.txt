HELEN Hiya, Julie. I was beginning to think you weren't coming. 
JULIE (coming in) I was at my mother's house. Did they call you? They said they were going to call you. 
HELEN Yeah, your mother was very sweet. 
JULIE You should have seen my father. I said, "Pa, you have another grandchild coming." So he said, "Who?" So I said, "Charlie." So he said, "That little Helen?" So I said, "If it isn't that little Helen, Charlie better leave town." So out came the beer. Well, they've been after Charlie to have a baby for a long time now. I said, "Pa, leave him alone. Let him get established before he saddles himself with a baby." Anyway, I want you to know joy reigns supreme in your in-laws' house. (she moves into the kitchen) How's Charlie taking it? 
HELEN (following her into the kitchen) Listen, let me make you a cup of tea or something. 
JULIE No, no, I've been drinking beer for the last two hours, celebrating your baby. 
HELEN Soda, anything like that? 
JULIE No, honey, you go on with your wash. Is that what you're doing? (she sits) When I had my first baby, Mike was ashamed to be seen on the streets with me. Well, listen, he was interning at the time. We needed a baby like a hole in the head. That's why he's a general practitioner now, because of that baby. He was studying to be a surgeon. He absolutely refused to admit I was pregnant. Even in my ninth month, and I was as big as a house. He used to walk ten paces in front of me in the street like he didn't know who that woman with the belly was. Where is Charlie anyway? 
HELEN I told you he-- 
JULIE Oh, yeah. I wouldn't let my Mike go on a bachelor party. 
HELEN (turning back to her wash) What are they going to do, get a little drunk? 
JULIE Are you kidding? What do you think these bachelor parties are for, bachelors? This is for the married men. It's a good excuse to get drunk and find some girls. 
HELEN Can you picture Charlie getting drunk and picking up a girl? Charlie's old sobersides. You should have seen what I went through to get him to make a pass at me. He's so sweet. Nobody knows how really sweet he is, he's so quiet all the time. My brother died in September, he used to stay up with me till three, four o'clock every night. I used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me. I used to look at him talking there, and I used to think: "What would I do without this sweet man here? I'd go crazy." You know, you like to be a little cynical sometimes, Julie. 
JULIE Wait'll you've been married eleven years. 
HELEN You like to talk about all the affairs everybody's husband is having. Do you know actually one woman whose husband is actually playing around? 
An abrupt, sad expression, tinged with pain, has come over Julie's face. She looks down at the table. 
JULIE Wait'll you've been married eleven years. 
Helen, aware that she has perhaps touched on a sensitive subject, frowns and turns back to her washing. A quick, thick silence dips into the room. 
JULIE (looking down) Wait'll Charlie gets to be forty-two. My Mike's having an affair right now with one of his patients right now. We don't talk about it -- don't you, either, not even to Charlie. But Mike knows I know about it. I even know the patient. A married woman with a hyperthyroid problem. My Mike's a good doctor with a pretty good practice. The kids are crazy about him. But every now and then he has to go out and get involved with a woman. 
She looks down at her hands in her lap. 
JULIE Listen, I will take a cup of tea if you've got one. 
She stands, opens the pantry, looks around among the cans and packages for a box of tea bags. 
HELEN (quite shocked) You're kidding, aren't you? 
JULIE (finds the box of tea bags) Would I kid about something like that? 
She puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a saucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills it with water. Helen regards her, not quite knowing what to say. Julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at it. 
JULIE I don't know why I told you. Don't tell anybody, not even Charlie. I don't want the family to know. But this woman isn't the first one. I know that much. About three years ago, the doorbell rings. I open the door. There's a man there. He says: "Tell your husband to stay away from my sister." How would you like to open the door and have somebody say that to you? I cried for two weeks. I don't know what to do about it, Helen. Should I bring it out in the open with Mike or should I just keep my mouth shut like the other time? Because he's not going to leave me. Even if he doesn't care about me, he has his kids to think about. We married too young. That was our big mistake. We married too young. 
Her face, her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any possibility of breaking into tears, and she sits down abruptly on the kitchen stool, her eyes clenched tight and her face rigidly impassive. Helen remains nervously silent.

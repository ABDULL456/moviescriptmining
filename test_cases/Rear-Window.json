{"train": "\"REAR WINDOW\" \nby \nJohn Michael Hayes \nBased on a short story \nby \nCornell Woolrich \nFinal Draft \nDecember 1, 1953 \nFADE IN: \nINT. JEFFERIES' APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT \nAlthough we do not see the foreground window frame, we see the whole background of a Greenwich Village street. \nWe can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town street, sharply etched by the morning sun. \nSome are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction. \nThe apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not. \nThe neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful planning. \nThe summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. \nIt has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running. \nTHE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window. It registers 84. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf. \nTo the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top of the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the radio stops, and the announcer is heard. \nANNOUNCER The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. The temperature, outside, 84 -- Friends -- is your life worth one dollar? \nThe man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of commercial voices until he again finds some music. \nContented, he returns to his shaving. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. It goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm clock hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A man rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch the alarm off. \nWe see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his sitting position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. To our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in opposite directions. They sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night. \nTHE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another low building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. Just inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fan sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it is an automatic toaster. \nBehind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman, apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stomach, navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker. \nShe picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her lack of clothes. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen between two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, but a Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run behind the truck, playing in the water. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the cage are two lovebirds -- arguing. \nTHE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through the open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see more of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to show a head and shoulders of him. \nHe is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty five, his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of moral strength and basic honesty. \nHe is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair. \nTHE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of his toes. Along the white cast someone has written \"Here lie the broken bones of L. B. Jefferies.\" \nTHE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shattered and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-action news photographers. \nOn the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glossy photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come off the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly into the camera lens. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall. \nIt is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. That the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising when the short distance between the camera and the explosion is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner of the picture reads -- \"L. B. Jefferies.\" \nTHE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line at an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and police are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot. \nClubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same signature, \"L. B. Jefferies,\" is in the corner. \nTHE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violence. The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through binoculars. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cameras, photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer on which is resting a negative of a woman's head. \nFrom this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we have just passed. \nTHE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines -- perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publication. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE UP \nThe screen is filled with the top of a desk. In addition to the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger- sized mat prints. Some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions. The center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page. Behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk. \nTHE CAMERA PANS UP and we are now face to face with IVAR GUNNISON and JACK BRYCE. Gunnison is sitting on a window- ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the New York streets. Bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him. \nGunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. Bryce has a cigarette in his mouth. He scratches a match, and is about to light it, when he notices that Gunnison, still reading the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and produced a cigarette. Quickly, Bryce moves over to light Gunnison's cigarette. Then he settles back to light his own. Gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him. \nGUNNISON (Looks up) Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high. \nBRYCE From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there. \nGUNNISON (Stands) This could go off in a month -- or an hour. \nBRYCE I'll pull somebody out of Japan. \nGUNNISON (Heads for his phone) Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town. (Picks up phone) Get me L. B. Jefferies. \nBRYCE (Puzzled) Jefferies? \nGUNNISON (To Bryce; still holding phone) Name me a better photographer. \nJEFF It's worse than the Chinese water torture. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe now see the source of the piano music. It comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. The short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. He continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear-catching. \nIt is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment. \nHe stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc. \nHe takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. He then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff frowns at the double sound, and raises his voice a little. He continues the conversation which has been heard all through the previous scene. \nGUNNISON Read some good books. \nJEFF I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore. \nGUNNISON I'll send you some comic books. \nJEFF (Low, tense) Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic. \nGUNNISON Like what? \nJEFF (On filter) I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere. \nGUNNISON It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. \nJEFF Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife. \nGUNNISON Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss. \nJefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house. \nThe brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. \nOn the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well- muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nWith his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. \nJEFF Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag. \nGUNNISON Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff. \nJEFF Next time, have some good news. \nHe hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff shifts his look more to the right. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe man enters the bedroom. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. Pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as \"You should have been home two hours ago! I could be lying here dying for all you'd know -- or care!\" The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. \nHe shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. \nBack in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. It gives no relief. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. \nThey are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. Finally, he waters them. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nInto the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. \nShe wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter. She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. \nHer skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation. No sooner has she settled into her chair, than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He notices her, but doesn't speak. \nShe begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. \nBehind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. \nSTELLA McGAFFERY comes in. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark- haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. She carries a small black bag. \nStella pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. He doesn't appear to notice her entrance. \nSTELLA (Loud) The New York State sentence for a peeping Tom is six months in the workhouse! \nHe doesn't turn. \nJEFF Hello Stella. \nAs she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand: \nSTELLA Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause. (Peers at him) What is it? You have a fight? \nJEFF No. \nSTELLA (After a pause) Her father loading up the shotgun? \nJEFF Stella! \nSTELLA It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say. \nJEFF She's just not the girl for me. \nSTELLA She's only perfect. \nJEFF Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want. \nSTELLA (Cautiously) Is what you want something you can discuss? \nJeff gives an exasperated look. \nJEFF It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties. \nSTELLA People with sense can belong wherever they're put. \nJEFF Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank? (Almost to himself) If only she was ordinary. \nStella sprinkles powder on his back, spreads it around. \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she helps Jeff to a sitting position. He buttons on his shirt. \nSTELLA You're never going to marry? \nJEFF Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES IN as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. He, stops as he notice her attitude. Then he goes on with less conviction: \nJEFF The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. \nSTELLA I can just hear you now. \"Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!\" \nJEFF (After pause) That's the hard part. \nShe swings him around in front of the window. He starts to look out. \nSTELLA Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle. \nJEFF There's an intelligent way to approach marriage. \nSTELLA (Scoffing) Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage! \nJeff swings his chair back to look at her. \nJEFF We've progressed emotionally in -- \nSTELLA (Interrupting) Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam \nJEFF People have different emotional levels that -- \nSTELLA (Interrupting again) Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz! \nJeff can't help smiling. \nSTELLA When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it. \nJEFF That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich? \nShe relaxes. \nSTELLA Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her. \nJEFF (Smiles) She pay you much? \nStella leaves for the kitchen in a huff. Jeff turns his chair to the window. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady, and the man with the flowers. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. There is no sign of the man with the flowers. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nShe is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. Dreamily, and methodically, she is brushing her long copper- colored hair. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nHis eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nHe is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs. \nWe now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. He takes off the hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. \nThey part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nThere is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. \nSTELLA (Quietly) Window shopper. \nHe freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJEFF You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nShe reaches for the doorknob, turns it: \nLISA (Simply) Better than that. The \"21.\" \nShe swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - CLOSEUP \nHis reaction is one of tender amusement. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - SUNSET - MEDIUM SHOT \nLISA Thank you for waiting Carl. \nHe smiles, nods enters. He goes down the stairs, as she follows. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them. \nLISA Kitchen's on the left. I'll take the wine. \nHe hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table. He moves toward the kitchen. \nCARL Good evening, Mr Jefferies. \nJEFF Hello. \nCarl goes into the kitchen. \nLISA (Up, to Carl) Just put everything right in the oven Carl. On \"low.\" \nCARL (Off) Yes ma'am. \nLISA (Enthusiastically) Let's open the wine now. It's a Montrachet. \nJEFF (Appreciatively) A big glassful. \nShe moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet. \nProduces two glasses, hold them up. \nLISA Big enough? \nJEFF Fine. Corkscrew's on the right. \nShe finds it. Puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew. \nLISA I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest. \nJEFF Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving. \nLISA (Struggling with cork) Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget. \nCarl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven. He sets it down he sees Lisa struggling with the corkscrew. \nCARL Let me, madam. \nShe does. He takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly inserts it and levers the cork out. He deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle in the wine bucket. Lisa has opened her purse to produce some money, in bills. She hands it to the waiter. \nLISA This will take care of the taxi as well. \nCarl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket. \nCARL Thank you, Miss Fremont. \nHe picks up the warning oven. \nCARL Have a pleasant dinner, Mr. Jefferies. \nJEFF Thank you. \nCarl goes up the stairs and out the door, while THE CAMERA REMAINS on Lisa and Jeff. She picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward Jeff. She seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass. We notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside. They raise their glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT. \nLISA What a day I've had! \nJEFF Tired? \nLISA Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the \"21\" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show. (Softly, looking up to him) Then I had to dash back and change. \nJEFF (Mock seriousness -- one girl to another) Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing? \nLISA (Seriously) She looked very cool. She had on a mint green -- \nShe breaks off with a little laugh, and a slight reproachful look at Jeff. She sips her drink then says: \nLISA And to think, I planted three nice items about you in the columns today. \nJeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle. \nLISA You can't buy that kind of publicity. \nJEFF That's good news. \nLISA Someday you might want to open up your own studio here. \nJEFF How could I run it from say -- Pakistan? \nShe puts down her glass and slides along the window seat nearer to him, THE CAMERA CLOSING IN. She looks up at him with a serious frankness. \nLISA Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment. \nJEFF I wish there was one I wanted. \nLISA Make the one you want. \nJEFF (As if he can't believe her) You mean leave the magazine? \nLISA Yes. \nJEFF For what? \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nWe get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. Whoever he has called answers. And instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. He relaxes, smiles, is warm. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. In the bedroom, his wife has become aware of the call. \nQuietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. The wall hides her from our view. \nThen suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone, and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. She climbs in bed laughing. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen and has another drink. He stands there, controlling an outburst of emotion, and seems almost to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nWhile Jeff has been engaged in watching this little drama, the SOUND of a piano has started. He now diverts his attention from the salesman's apartment to the source of the piano music. He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's apartment. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThrough the studio window of the song-writer's apartment we see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is farther along the line of the melody than before. \nIt is beginning to take some shape, and give promise of its full beauty. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff, listening to the composer. His head turns as Lisa's voice comes over: \nLISA (Emerging from kitchen) Where's that music coming from? \nTHE CAMERA QUICKLY PULL BACK as Jeff swings his chair around. Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor. \nJEFF Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage. \nLISA (Putting down the food) I think it's enchanting. \nShe pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table. We now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. \nLISA Almost as if it were being written especially for us. \nJEFF (Pleasantly) No wonder he's having so much trouble with it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nA faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. \nLISA Well, at least you can't say the dinner isn't right. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff looks at her soberly. \nJEFF Lisa, it's perfect (Looks down at the food, without enthusiasm) As always. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThe brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa slowly helping Jeff to lobster from the main dish. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nShooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan- bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. There is one light burning, behind Lisa's head. A fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body and legs. \nLISA There can't be that much difference between people and the way they live! We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, sleep, wear clothes -- \nJeff raises both his hands. \nJEFF Well now, look -- \nLisa draws back one leg, and points a finger challengingly. \nLISA If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand -- \nJEFF There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that -- \nLISA (Won't let him break in) It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily? \nJEFF Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain -- \nLISA (Ignores him) What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation. \nJEFF All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but -- \nLISA It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff begin to get desperate. \nJEFF I made a simple, but true statement and I'll back it up, if you'll just shut up for a minute! \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa, stretched out on the divan. She looks at him for a moment without speaking. Then: \nLISA If your opinion is as rude as your manner, I'm not sure I want to hear it. \nWe see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture. \nJEFF (Soothing her) Lisa, simmer down -- will you? \nLISA (Something starts her up again) You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same -- \nJEFF (Loud, sharp) Lisa! Shut up! \nLisa turns on her side, and stares into the room, angrily. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nAfter a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly: \nJEFF Did you ever eat fish heads and rice? \nLISA Of course not. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI LONG SHOT \nJeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand. \nJEFF Well -- when'll I see you again? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nLisa, standing in the open doorway. \nLISA Not for a long time. Not, at least until -- (She begins smiling) -- tomorrow night. \nContinues smiling as she close the door softly behind her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThe pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. He reaches for a nearby phone picks up the receiver, dials. It buzzes on filter. \nReceiver up on filter. \nGUNNISON (Filter) Hello. \nJEFF Gunnison? \nGUNNISON Yeah. Is that you, Jeff? \nJEFF It's me. \nGUNNISON Something wrong? \nJEFF The word is \"everything.\" Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday? \nGUNNISON (Unhappy) Jeff -- \nJEFF (Won't give him time to argue) I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it. \nGUNNISON (Wearily, after pause) Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up. \nJEFF That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy. \nGUNNISON Yeah. \nJeff hangs up, looks up to the door through which Lisa left. He's not particularly happy. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff returns to the window. He lights a cigarette and smokes it peacefully, as he contemplates the neighborhood. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe CAMERA slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an odd window lit here and there. In the distant street there is still some traffic passing, with one or two pedestrians going by. THE CAMERA completes its sweep, and starts to move back again. Somewhere a dog howls. The PANNING CAMERA comes to a sudden halt. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff smiles a little, but as the howl continues, his expressions sobers. His eyes begin to scan the neighborhood, as if looking for the source. He fails to find it, and sits there, puzzled and disturbed. The scene, and the sound of the dog: \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff's chair is turned facing the window so that we see the darkened room behind him. There is just one side light burning, which illuminates the side of his face. \nHis head nods sleepily as he dozes. He opens his eyes and looks out, as a slight sound of rain starts. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT \nFrom his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting to fall. It is sort, gentle rain, not a downpour. There are still some windows lit in the neighborhood. The apartment house corridors all have small night lights burning. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff wakens a little more fully as his attentions is drawn to: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe couple who sleep on the fire escape. The increasing rain cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside. The man, hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing of the fire escape, lets it slip through his fingers. As if falls to the garden below, the CAMERA FANS SWIFTLY down with it. When the clock hits the ground, the alarm goes off sending a shrill sound through the neighborhood. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff smiles at the incident, and then lowers his eyes slightly as something else catches his attention. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nComing out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor below is the salesman with the nagging wife. The shades are drawn in his apartment, but a light burns dimly behind them. The salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase -- the same one we saw him with earlier in the day. The sound of the alarm startles him. He turns toward the window a moment listening. Then reassured that is is nothing important, he turns and moves down the corridor. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff is puzzled. He looks down a moment in thought. Then he darts his eyes and swings them toward the left. \nHe looks steadily toward the distant street corner. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe street corner, lighted by a lamp, is deserted. A moment later, the salesman, still carrying the suitcase, moves diagonally across the corner, head down against the rain. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff looks wonderingly at this nocturnal activity. Then he looks down at his wristwatch. \nINSERT \nJeff's watch reads 1:55. \nQUICK FADE OUT: \nQUICK FADE IN: \nINSERT \nThe watch now reads 2:35. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJEFF I was. \nSTELLA (Massaging harder) What'll you do if one of them catches you? \nJEFF Depends one which one. \nShe stops massaging, reaches for the oil. \nJEFF Now Miss Torso, for example -- \nStella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes his breath. \nSTELLA Keep your mind off her. \nJEFF She's real eat, drink and be merry girl. \nSTELLA And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable. \nJEFF Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone. \nSTELLA Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. \nJEFF And some man will lose his. \nSTELLA Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction? \nJEFF Well, the salesman could be available soon. \nSTELLA (Interested in the scandal) He and his wife splitting up? \nJEFF It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case. \nSTELLA (So?) Isn't he a salesman? \nJEFF Now what could he sell at three in the morning? \nSTELLA (Shrugs) Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. \nJEFF He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain. \nShe helps him to a sitting position. \nSTELLA His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward. \nJEFF Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run. \nSTELLA (Looks at him) But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it. \nJeff turns his head away for a moment. She helps him into the chair. Hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. The back of his chair is to the window. \nSTELLA (Putting oil and power away) What about this morning? Any developments? \nJEFF No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment. \nSTELLA (stops) In this heat? (Turns, looks over his shoulder) They're up now. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nHe quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. It is not a casual look, but a long, careful, searching appraisal of all the apartment house windows in his neighborhood, starting from his left to his right. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. \nJEFF Get back! Out of sight! Quick! \nHe propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. \nSTELLA (A startled whisper) What is it? What's the matter? \nJeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. \nJEFF (Quietly) The salesman's looking out his window. \nStella relaxes, gives Jeff a disgusted look, and starts to move out of the shadows. \nSTELLA A Federal offense. \nJEFF (Sharply) Get back there! He'll see you! \nShe moves back into the shadows. \nSTELLA I'm not shy. I've been looked at before. \nJEFF (Still peering toward window) It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nTHE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying: \nLISA Well, \"ain't I?\" -- Pay attention to me. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - TWO SHOT \nWe are now able to see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. By her position, Lisa is seated on Jeff's sound knee, her arms around his neck. \nJEFF I'm not exactly on the other side of the room. \nLISA Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him. \nShe starts kissing him. \nJEFF Don't you ever have any problems? \nLISA (Murmurs, kissing him) I have one now. \nJEFF So do I. \nLISA (Kissing) Tell me about it. \nJEFF (Slight pause) Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times? \nLISA He likes the way his wife welcomes him home. \nJEFF Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today? \nLISA Homework. It's more interesting. \nJEFF What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper? \nLISA Nothing, thank heaven. \nJEFF (Looking again) Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day? \nLISA I wouldn't dare answer that. \nJEFF (After pause) Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong. \nShe gives up trying to interest him in romance, and moves back from the embrace. THE CAMERA PULL BACK. \nLISA And I'm afraid it's with me. \nLisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesman's life. \nJEFF (Looks at Lisa) What do you think? \nLISA (Without returning his look) Something too frightful to utter. \nJeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles a little. He turns to the window to look out again. Lisa exits the picture. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa stretches herself out on the divan. Her head rest on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. However, her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nHe stares intently out the window. \nJEFF He went out a few minutes ago -- in his undershirt -- and he hasn't come back yet. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nLisa weighs this information, trying to make some sense out of it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff turns his eyes from the salesman's apartment, and looks down reflectively. He looks up again, and then his eyes catches sight of something. He leans forward slightly. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. She is reading a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another. \nHer back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nHe looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. \nJEFF You know -- that would be terrible job to tackle. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nLisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. \nJEFF How would you begin to cut up a human body? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. At that moment the songwriter returns to his composing. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. \nAlthough it is not complete, it is farther along then before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. \nLisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. \nLISA Jeff -- I'll be honest with you -- you're beginning to scare me a little. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hear Lisa's voice: \nLISA (Quietly insistent) Jeff -- did you hear what I said? You're beginning to -- \nJeff puts out a restraining hand. \nJEFF (Interrupting) Be quiet! Shhh! (Pause) He's coming back! \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nAt last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff quickly puts the glasses up. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT \nBy the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed from the left. In momentarily blocks out the side of our freight truck. By the time the two trucks part, we can only see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out of sight. Jeff is only able to read the words \"FREIGHT LINES\". The binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house. \nAnd by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT \nThe figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nSHOOTING TOWARDS the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer. \nThe second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is POLICE DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT THOMAS J. DOYLE, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. He has a sense of humor. He lowers the glasses, and turns to Jeff. \nDOYLE You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder? \nJEFF Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more. \nDOYLE I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely. \nJEFF Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand. \nDoyle paces a little. \nDOYLE It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- (He points) -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up. \nJEFF Well, officer -- do your duty. \nDOYLE You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage. \nJEFF I'll bet it's been done. \nDOYLE Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked. \nJEFF (A pause) You think I made all this up? \nDOYLE I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation. \nJEFF For instance? \nDOYLE (Shrugs) His wife took a trip. \nJEFF She -- was -- an -- invalid! \nDOYLE You told me. (Looks at watch) I've got to run, Jeff. \nJEFF All right -- you don't believe me. \nDoyle saunters toward steps, picking up his hat on the way. Stops. \nDOYLE I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity. \nJEFF (Coldly) Thanks. \nDOYLE We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where. \nJEFF Do that. \nHe goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat. \nHe pauses his hand on the door knob. \nDOYLE You have any headaches lately? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. \nJEFF Not 'til you showed up. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle, still at the door: \nDOYLE Uh-huh. Well, it'll wear off in time -- along with the hallucinations. See you around. \nHe starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nFrom Doyle's viewpoint. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nBefore the door has completely closed, Doyle opens it again, and looks in. \nDOYLE By the way  what happened to your leg? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJEFF I was jaywalking. \nDOYLE'S VOICE (O.S.) Where? \nJEFF (With nonchalance) The Indianapolis Speedway. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nThe door starts to close again, as if Doyle considered Jeff's answer quite reasonable. Then the door pops open and Doyle's head comes in, a surprised expression across his face. \nDOYLE During the race? \nJEFF Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence. \nDOYLE I can't do that. \nJEFF I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. \nDOYLE I can't do it even if he's gone. \nJEFF (With sarcasm) What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department? \nDOYLE Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes! \nJEFF Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear. \nDOYLE At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase \"search warrant\" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence. \nJEFF Give him evidence. \nDOYLE I can hear myself starting out. \"Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --\" (He shakes his head \"no\") He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes. \nJEFF By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment. \nDOYLE (Looking out window) A detective's nightmare. \nJEFF What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door? \nDOYLE (Looking out window) One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer! \nDOYLE (Turns and look at Jeff) How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years? \nJEFF You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question? \nDOYLE Ever get an answer? \nJEFF Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: \"Your request for transfer turned down --\" \nHe can't help smiling, and neither can Doyle. \nDOYLE Sorry I had to turn it down. (He checks his watch) I'm going over to the railroad station and check Thorwald's story. \nHe moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat. \nJEFF Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it! \nDOYLE Oh -- I almost forgot! \nHe pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him intently. \nDOYLE (Looking at Jeff) There was a postcard in Thorwald's mailbox. (Refers to paper) Mailed yesterday afternoon, three- thirty P.M. from Merritsville -- (Looks up, speaks pleasantly) -- That's eighty miles north of here. (Back to paper) The message read \"Arrived O.K. Already feeling better. Love, Anna.\" \nHe looks at Jeff with some smugness. \nJEFF (Slowly) Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is? \nDOYLE (Nods \"yes\") Mrs. Thorwald. \nHe puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. \nDOYLE (Maliciously) Anything you need? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff is sober. \nJEFF Yeah. A good detective. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP \nThe sun has just set. THE CAMERA is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich. \nJeff's hand comes in, picks it up. We PAN US with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. (Except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness.) As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald's apartment is darkness. THE CAMERA PANS slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view. She is wearing a Kelly Green suit, and is seated at her dressing table. She seems to be putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going out. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP \nJeff looks down, he smiles to himself. He turns, and we see him raise the long-focus camera to his eye. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT \nThe long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed. \nA pair of ill-fitting, horn-rimmed reading glasses rest half way down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lip-stick, with their aid. \nSatisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face as a whole, through squinting eyes. She has faded good looks, has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. \nShe puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of determination. \nShe turns out the lights behind her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff lowers the long-focus lens, and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody which we have heard him trying to complete. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe songwriter is at the piano, poking out his melody, slowly, note by note. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the apartment he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is setting out trays of canap\u00e9s, glasses, ice and liquor. She pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. Her expression shows that it pleases her, and moves her romantically. She comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the beginning again, playing it more fully. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nA new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing. It is orchestral ballet music, in a modern style. Jeff's head turns in this new direction. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Torso, and a male partner whom we have not seen before, are practicing a pas a deux. He is a tall flowing-haired young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity. \nThey stop, at one point, to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a professional choreographer. \nTHE CAMERA PANS from this to the street beyond. \nDoyle reaches for a cigarette on the table, and puts it to his lips. While searching his pockets for a match, he HEARS Lisa humming. His eyes turn upward. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nOver the cabinet which divides the living room from the kitchen, we can see a glimpse of Lisa's shadow on the ceiling. \nSEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff, has followed Doyle's look. \nSEMI CLOSEUP \nDoyle picks up cigarette lighter from table, and lights his cigarette. As he is placing the lighter back on the table, he sees: \nCLOSEUP \nFrom his viewpoint, Lisa's bag containing her lingerie and overnight effects. \nCLOSEUP \nJeff. His eyes turn from the lingerie up to Doyle. \nCLOSEUP \nDoyle's look is completely noncommittal. His eyes turn at the sound of the song-writer's party. He moves forward to get a better view, as the CAMERA RETREATS in front of him. He stops to glance out of the window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe party is now full progress. The room is overcrowded. And some people are now sitting on the floor with their backs to the window. Others are outside. A crowd hides the piano player, but music can be head competing with the babble. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nDoyle turns his head away, and looks straight out. His expression hardens a little, as he sees: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe window of Thorwald's apartment, completely dark. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nHe also is looking toward Thorwald's apartment. He turns his eyes anxiously back to Doyle. He seems to be trying to penetrate Doyle's mind. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nDoyle turns his head from the window, and looks down at Jeff. He asks, quietly: \nDOYLE What else do you have on this man Thorwald? \nJeff's tension eases off a little, by he is eager to talk. \nJEFF Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him. \nDOYLE (Soberly) You think he's getting out of here? \nJEFF Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing. \nDoyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. Doyle nods thoughtfully. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nDoyle reacts to her appreciatively. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nShe continues rotating the brandy. \nLISA I'm just warming some brandy. \nShe comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. She offers the second to Doyle. (NOTE: In the following set of scenes, whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter, it is being rotated- regardless of their attitudes.) \nLISA Mr. Doyle? -- I presume. \nDoyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly. \nJEFF Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont. \nDoyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. \nDOYLE How do you do? \nLisa smiles in return. \nLISA We think Thorwald's guilty. \nShe turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the fist sight of her attractiveness. \nThen quickly, his eyes move down and to the left. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nThe open overnight case with its displayed lingerie. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT SEMI-CLOSEUP \nSlowly Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nQuickly guessing what's on Doyle's mind \nJEFF (Cautiously) Careful, Tom. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle's eyes travel past Jeff to look out the window. \nHe still holds the brandy snifter in one hand, and a cigarette in the other. Absentmindedly he still rotates the brandy. The SOUND of the phone ringing is heard. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle comes up to the CAMERA, looking at Lisa. \nDOYLE Look, Miss Fremont. That feminine intuition sells magazines -- but in real life, it's still a fairy tale. I don't know how many wasted years I've spent running down leads based on women's intuitions. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. \nJEFF I take it you didn't find the trunk -- And this is just an old speech you once gave at the Policeman's Ball. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle has turned away into the center of the room. He swings around. \nDOYLE I found the trunk -- a half hour after I left here. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nLisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm: \nLISA Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope. \nDOYLE (Off) When the lock is broken -- yes. \nJEFF What was in the trunk? A surly note to me? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle comes toward the CAMERA again. \nDOYLE (Carefully) Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable. \nLISA (Off) Didn't you take it to the crime lab? \nDoyle gives her a scathing look. \nDOYLE I sent it on its merry and legal way. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff challenges Doyle: \nJEFF Why -- when a woman only goes on a simple trip, does she take everything she owns? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nDoyle, with a studied, gracious gesture, to Lisa. \nDOYLE Let the female psychology department handle that one. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nLisa answers, but very coldly: \nLISA I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back. \nDOYLE (Off) That's what they call a family problem. \nJEFF (Persisting) If his wife wasn't coming back -- why didn't he tell his landlord? -- I'll answer it for you -- because he had something to hide. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nDoyle hesitates a moment, and lets his eyes wander, to: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThe overnight case, with Lisa's lingerie. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nHis eyes going back to Jeff. \nDOYLE (Blandly) Do -- uh -- you tell your landlord everything? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff replies, pointedly: \nJEFF I told you to be careful. \nLisa looks down at Jeff, not comprehending. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle points to one of the photographs on the wall. \nDOYLE If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money -- \nJEFF (Expressionless) All the things I hate. \nDoyle has a complete change of manner. He relaxes and smiles. \nDOYLE Now -- what do you say we sit down to a quiet, friendly drink or two -- forget all about this, and tell lies about the old days in the war? Hmmm? He looks from one to the other. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nNeither Jeff or Lisa display even the slightest friendliness. Their faces are cold and set. Then Lisa speaks, icily: \nLISA You're through with the case? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nDoyle is relaxed. \nDOYLE There isn't any \"case\" to be through with, Miss Fremont. Now let's get down to that friendly drink. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff and Lisa remain unmoved. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nLISA I'm not much on rear window ethics. \nJEFF Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to. \nLISA (Turns to him) Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see. \nJEFF Huh? \nLISA You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known. \nJeff starts to smile at the realization. \nLISA You'd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well. \nJeff smile is broad, and he starts to chuckle. She relaxes and joins him. She sits on his lap, her arms around his shoulders. \nLISA Whatever happened to that old saying \"Love Thy Neighbor.\" \nJEFF I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start? \nShe gets up, goes to the blinds, and proceeds to lower them one by on. \nLISA (As she get up) Not if I have to move into an apartment across the courtyard and do the dance of the seven veils once an hour. (As she lowers the blinds) Show's over for tonight. \nHe smiles. She goes to the table, picks up he overnight case. \nLISA Preview -- of the coming attractions. \nShe goes to the kitchen entrance, pauses. \nLISA Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case. \nJEFF (Mock seriousness) No, Lisa -- I don't think he did. \nShe shrugs, goes into the kitchen, the CAMERA PANNING her. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar, a drink in his hand. He starts to take a sip from the glass, when Lisa comes out of the kitchen. She is an ethereal beauty, in sheer peach nightgown, covered by a gossamer matching kimono. She turns gracefully in front of Jeff. \nHe lowers his drink. \nLISA (Softly) What do you think? \nJeff puts his drink on the bar. He tries to decide how to answer her question. He can't. \nLISA I'll rephrase the question. \nJEFF Thank you. \nLisa holds out the folds of her kimono. \nLISA Do you like it? \nJEFF (Studying it) Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- (motions horizontally) -- and two less that way -- (Motions vertically) -- I might give up bachelorhood. \nLisa turns playfully toward the kitchen. \nLISA I'll be right back. \nBlood-curdling scream from the courtyard outside suddenly cuts through the night. \nStartled, both Jeff and Lisa move quickly for the window -- Lisa lifting the blinds up. The long scream subsides into near-hysterical sobbing. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT \nWe get a high comprehensive view of all the apartments. \nLight are going on in some windows, shades are lifted on others, people are beginning to lean out looking for the source of the cream and sobbing. The song-writer's party comes to a sudden halt, as his guest crowd to the window. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nLisa and Jeff at the window, looking out, startled. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe landlord, beneath the newlyweds, looks out. Tilting his head up toward the center of the yard. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nA couple comes out on the high balcony to the right. \nLook down. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe newlywed's blinds come up, and for the first time we see both of them at the window, the girl looking over the boy's shoulder. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nSome members of the song-writer's party move out to the patio- balcony, to get a better look down in the yard. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe bird woman comes to the window. Her white face looks forward toward the center of the courtyard. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Torso, pulling a around her, comes out onto her porch, and looks to her left. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Hearing aid comes quickly into her backyard. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe couple who own the dog are standing on their fire escape. They are both looking down, but while the husband is quiet, the wife is holding her hands to the side of her head, sobbing loudly. We have heard her sobbing since the moment of the scream which she uttered. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nLying near the sidewalk in the backyard below the couple's fire escape, is the silent body of the little dog they own. Miss Lonely Hearts comes running out of the basement door. She goes directly to the dog, picks it up in her arms. Then she slowly turns and looks up at the sobbing woman above her. \nStella also turns, interrupting her \nSTELLA Nobody's invented polite words yet for killing. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP \nJeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face. He calls quickly: \nJEFF Lisa -- Lisa -- on the shelf over there -- get me the small yellow box -- \nHe turns halfway around, and points. We see Lisa moving behind him toward the shelf. He adds: \nJEFF And that little viewer. \nHe turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a little as Lisa comes up, and places the box and viewer in his hand. He opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light. Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background. \nJEFF (Half to himself as he searches slides) These aren't more than two weeks old -- I hope I didn't take all leg art. (Discovers the right slide) I think this is the one. \nPuts the other slides to one side and puts the selected one onto the viewer, with sounds of satisfaction. As he lifts the viewer to his eyes Lisa asks impatiently: \nLISA Jeff -- what are you looking for? \nHe squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it. \nJEFF Something -- that if I'm right -- might solve a murder. \nHe looks back through the viewer. \nSTELLA Mrs. Thorwald? \nJEFF Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it. \nHe takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa. \nJEFF You take a look and tell me what you see. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP \nLisa raises the viewer to her eye. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CLOSEUP \nThrough the viewer we see the identical view out of the window. \nJEFF (Over) Now take it away. \nThe viewer moves away, and we are left with the identical scene, but not quite so still, a slight breeze stirring the foliage. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff looks up to a puzzled Lisa. \nJEFF Well? \nLISA It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all. \nJEFF I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed. \nSTELLA You mean the one the dog was sniffing around? \nJEFF (To Stella) And digging in. (Points out window) Look at that flower bed. \nThey all lean forward to look. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe flower bed. The flowers have a slight dip in the center. Jeff speaks off: \nJEFF There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks? \nSTELLA There's something buried there. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT \nAll three ease back in awe. Lisa, still looking out, says: \nLISA (Breathing it) Mrs. Thorwald! \nSuddenly Stella begins to chuckle. They look around at her. Her face sobers as she answers their unasked question: \nSTELLA You haven't spent much time in cemeteries, have you? (they don't answer) Mr. Thorwald could hardly put his wife into a plot of ground scarcely one foot square. \nJeff and Lisa slowly turn their heads to look out at the garden. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe garden again with its small indentation of flowers over this we hear the ghoulish voice of Stella: \nSTELLA Unless, he puts in standing on end -- which would be very original and not require the use of either a knife or a saw. My guess is she's scattered all over town. A leg in the East River -- an arm -- \nLISA (Cuts in) Stella, please. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff looks at Stella. \nJEFF Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again. \nLISA (Has a hard time saying it) It could be -- the knife, and the saw. \nSTELLA (Quickly) Call Lieutenant Doyle! \nLISA No -- let's wait. Let's wait until it gets dark. I'll go over and dig it up! \nHalfway through Lisa's speech, Jeff begins speaking. \nJEFF (To Stella) I'm not going to call Doyle until I show him the body of Mrs. Thorwald -- (To Lisa) And you're not going to dig up anything, an get your neck broken too. \nTHE CAMERA EASES BACK to allow Lisa to sit on the divan, and Jeff turn his chair toward her. Stella still look out the window, thinking. \nJEFF What we've got to do is find some way to get in there, and -- \nStella's quiet voice brings him to a halt. \nJEFF Not as long as you tell me what you're looking at. \nShe lifts it to her eye. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nMiss Lonely Hearts' apartment. She has opened a small brown bottle, and taken out four red capsules which she places on the white table cloth of her little table. \nThere is a candle burning in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment. She is dressed in sedate street clothes. She sits at the table, and by the light of the candle proceeds to open a black-covered book, and read it. The print is fine. She bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and returns to the book. She seems quite at peace. Stella and Jeff are heard over: \nSTELLA I wonder. \nJEFF What? \nSTELLA Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules. \nJEFF You can tell that from here? \nSTELLA I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter. \nJEFF Would four of them -- ? \nSTELLA (Breaks in) No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible. \nJEFF (After a slight pause) Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nStella lowers the long-focus lens. \nSTELLA You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all. \nJEFF You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult. \nThe door bursts open, and they both turn quickly toward the entrance. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nLisa comes in, panting and flushed. She stands a second at the door, catching her breath, but smiling with the pleasure of sampling danger and escaping unharmed. \nLISA Wasn't that close? \nJEFF (Off) Too close. \nShe comes down the stairs. \nLISA What was his reaction? I mean when he looked at the note? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nAs Lisa comes up to the two of them. \nSTELLA Well, it wasn't the kind of expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank. \nLisa comes close to Jeff, speaks warmly. \nLISA Jeff -- how did I do? \nHe takes her hands. \nJEFF Real professional. Would have made a great layout for the Bazaar. The model pressed back against a brick wall, eyes wild, tense. Low cut bodice, in new suspicious black, with a -- \nSome of the pleasure goes out of her face. Stella notices it. \nSTELLA (Interrupts Jeff) You'd make a good door prize at a wake. \nIt relieves the slight friction, as both Jeff and Lisa laugh. Lisa happens to look toward the window, and the laugh dies. \nLISA Jeff -- the handbag. \nJeff and Stella turn toward the window. Jeff grabs the long- focus lens, lifts it up. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nThorwald has the new alligator bag belonging to his wife, in his hand. He moves slowly across the bedroom, out of sight behind the door. He doesn't appear in the living room. In a moment he reappears, moving back to his packing. He puts the handbag into one of the suitcases -- the one which he has almost completed filling. He goes on with his packing. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff puts down the long-focus lens, and turns around toward the room. The two women watch him expectantly. \nJEFF Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag. (Supporting his proposition) During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band. \nLISA (Excited) And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring! (To Stella) Do you ever leave yours at home? \nStella lifts her left hand, and looks fondly at her ring finger. \nSTELLA The only way anybody could get that off would be to chop my finger -- Let's go down and find out what's buried in the garden. \nLISA Why not? I always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald. \nJeff looks at them aghast. \nJEFF What are you two talking about? \nSTELLA Got a shovel? \nJEFF No. \nSTELLA There's probably one in the basement. \nJEFF Now wait a minute -- \nLISA Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look. \nJEFF Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog -- \nStella grows a little uneasy. Her eyes drift toward Thorwald's apartment. \nSTELLA (To Lisa) You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there. \nJEFF There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. (He points) Give me the phone book, Lisa. \nLisa moves for the phone book on the stand near the kitchen. \nThorwald is displaying indignation and complaint to the police as he nods his head vigorously toward Lisa. At this the police start to advance into the apartment, going directly for Lisa. She flashes a quick look toward Jeff's window. She turns back as the first policeman reaches her. He starts to question her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nStella turns away and goes quickly to the table for the binoculars. Jeff still is using the long-focus lens. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - BINOCULAR SHOT \nWe see Lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner she used with Thorwald previously, as if to say she came into the apartment by mistake. Thorwald, listening, comes quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. He holds out the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the empty handbag. The policeman, impressed, looks back to Lisa for an explanation. She has none. Over this we hear Stella frantically asking: \nSTELLA What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in? \nJEFF Smart girl. \nSTELLA Smart? She'll be arrested! \nJEFF That'll get her out of there, won't it? \nThe first policeman indicates that Lisa is to come along with him. He pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from Thorwald about the attempted burglary. The second policeman reaches for the jewelry in Thorwald's hand, and takes it for examination. In the brief pause while the two policemen speak to each other, Lisa starts to wave her left hand behind her back. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff looking through his camera. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nWe get a closer view of the waving hand. She stops waving and holds her fingers spread out. With her other hand she points to the wedding ring on her left hand. \nSTELLA Mrs. Thorwald's ring! \nTHE LENS PANS UPWARD AND ACROSS until it brings Thorwald's profile into the picture. He is looking down directly at Lisa's hands. His head slowly turns, and he looks right up -- directly into the lens. Suddenly he becomes aware that Lisa is signaling to someone who is watching him. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff and Stella. He drops the camera into his lap. \nJEFF Stella! The lights! He'd seen us! \nStella hurries from the window, turning off lights, as Jeff backs his chair into the room. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nAs Thorwald's attention is drawn back to the second policeman to answer further questions, the first policeman takes Lisa by the arm and leads her out of the apartment. He goes down the corridor pushing the curious people away from the door. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe last light out, Stella stops to catch her breath, and turns to Jeff. \nSTELLA When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this? \nJEFF (Urgently) Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there? \nSTELLA (Squinting out window) Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up. \nJeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets. \nJEFF My billfold! In the right hand drawer. \nStella moves to get it. \nSTELLA What do you need money for? \nJEFF To bail Lisa out of jail. \nShe finds a billfold, hands it to Jeff. He takes it, extracts some bills and begins counting them. As he counts, Stella comments: \nSTELLA You know -- you could just leave her there until after next Tuesday -- so you could sneak away safely -- as planned. \nHe looks up sharply at her, and then without comment goes back to counting the money. \nJEFF (With obvious disappointment) One hundred and twenty-seven. \nSTELLA How much do you think you'll need? \nJEFF First offense burglary -- (He shrugs) -- probably two-fifty. (Gets an idea, points) The piggy bank. \nStella, following his pointing finger, gets a piggy bank down from a shelf on the sideboard. He takes it, cracks it on the knee of his cast. It splits open, and some money comes out. Mostly bills, a few silver halves. \nWhat he doesn't get, Stella picks up. \nSTELLA Ten here. \nJEFF Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough. \nSTELLA I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got. \nJeff does, as Stella gets her purse. \nJEFF What about the rest? \nSTELLA When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute. \nStella goes up to the door. The phone RINGS. Jeff grabs it, picks it up. Stella pauses. \nJEFF (To phone) Just a minute. (To Stella) I'll tell you who it is when you get back. \nStella goes quickly out the door. He returns to the phone call, glancing at the same time toward the courtyard. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJEFF Jefferies. \nDOYLE (Filter) This is Doyle, Jeff. \nJEFF (Urgently) Tom, I've got something real big for you. \nDOYLE (Wearily) Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be -- \nJEFF (Interrupting harshly) Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested. \nDOYLE (Slightest pause) Your Lisa? \nJEFF My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police. \nJeff doesn't answer. \nTHORWALD Say something! \nHe moves forward a couple of steps. \nTHORWALD (Sudden loud anger) Say something! Tell me what you want! \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff still doesn't speak. He grips the flash holder a little more tightly, lifts it just the fraction of an inch as if he is prepared to use it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nThorwald has advanced to the middle of the room, his eyes on Jeff and his hands clenching with the effort to control his anger. \nTHORWALD Can you get me that ring back? \nJEFF (Quietly) No. \nTHORWALD (Loud) Tell her to bring it back! \nHe advances a step. \nJEFF I can't. The police have it by now. \nTHORWALD Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh! \nThorwald starts to move threateningly for Jeff. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nFrom a three-quarter angle toward Thorwald. Jeff lifts the flash holder to face level and closes his eyes. He explodes the flash. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThorwald's face fills the screen registering shock, confusion. He throws up his hands for protection and recoils, making an involuntary sound of surprise. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA vision of Jeff and the apartment as seen by Thorwald. \nIt is distorted and out of focus, filled with large twisting balls of bright yellow color. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThorwald blinking, trying to regain his sight. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff ejects the used bulb and quickly inserts another. \nHe works furiously, sweating. He gets the bulb in the flash holder just in time to meet Thorwald coming at him. Jeff closes his eyes and another bulb explodes in Thorwald's face. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nThorwald's face, full screen again, as he recoils from the flash. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe apartment as seen by Thorwald again. Big, twisting balls of blinding yellow. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThorwald stumbles back against the side table, knocking objects off onto the floor, struggling for balance and sight. Jeff works rapidly to put a fresh bulb in the holder. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT \nThorwald regains his equilibrium and some of his sight. \nOrienting himself, he starts for Jeff again. This time, when the flash holder goes off, we see it from Jeff's angle. Thorwald is lighted almost white, shockingly outlining every detail of his face, clothes, hands. His rage and frustration are fixed for a brief but terrifying moment. He stumbles backward again, trying to brush the light away from his face almost as if it were a solid enveloping substance. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT \nJeff ejects a bulb, puts his last bulb into the flash holder. He tries to move the wheelchair a little further away from Thorwald. Then he raises the flash holder again. \nIn b.g. we see: Doyle, Lisa, Stella and the detectives come to Thorwald's door, try it. Locked. \nOne of the men steps forward with a flat steel jimmy and snaps the lock open. They move quickly into the darkened apartment. Doyle hits the lights inside the kitchen. The group goes into the living room. The lights go on. No sign of Thorwald. Doyle, Lisa and Stella instinctively turn and look toward Jeff's apartment. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nFrom Thorwald's apartment shooting at Jeff's window. A sudden bright flash is seen as the last flash bulb goes off. And it lights the scene of Jeff in the wheelchair and Thorwald diving through the air at him. Darkness rushes in, blacker than before. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThorwald has finally reached Jeff, knocking the flash equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him. \nIt is apparent that he is trying to pull Jeff out of the wheelchair. Jeff fights him off. \nThe wheelchair crashes over, spilling Jeff to the floor. \nThorwald is on top of him, lifting, dragging him to the window. Jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away from the window, but Thorwald is far too powerful for him. He strains to raise Jeff to the windowsill. \nTHORWALD I'll give you a good look out the window. \nSlowly, inexorably, he raises Jeff to the windowsill. \nJeff frantically grabs for the upright window frame, wrapping his arms around it. Thorwald shoves the rest of his body over the windowsill. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nDoyle, Lisa, Stella and the two detectives, crossing Thorwald's yard, see Jeff going out the window. Lisa is panicked. \nLISA Jeff! Jeff! \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM LONG SHOT \nFrom Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff hanging out the window and Thorwald hammering at his hands and arms with bare fists. \nDoyle pushes Lisa to one side and starts to scale the wall, preceded by the two detectives. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \n", "test1_input": "From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark. The couple are sleeping on the fire escape. The salesman's apartment is dark as well. Suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar. The flame of the match illuminates his face for a moment. When is dies out, we see just the glow of the cigar burning. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nThe CAMERA is now facing Jeff. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. The phone starts to RING, but makes only the slightest sound, as he instantly picks it up. As he talks, in a low voice, he keeps his eyes on the salesman's apartment. \nJEFF Yeah? \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nWe get an impression of Sixth Avenue behind Lisa at the phone. Lisa also talks in a low, quiet voice. \nLISA The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald. \nJEFF (Filter) What's the apartment house number? \nLISA 125 West Ninth Street. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff, still looks toward the salesman's apartment. \nJEFF Thanks, Lisa. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nLisa smilingly says: \nLISA Okay, chief. What's my next assignment. \nJEFF To get on home. \nLISA All right -- but what's he doing now? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment. \nJEFF Just sitting in the living room. In the dark. And he hasn't gone near the bedroom. Now get some sleep. Goodnight. \nHe puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT \nAll we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. He is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. There is a touch of urgency in his voice. \nJEFF Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those things I can't tell you on the phone. You have to be here, and see the whole set-up. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. \nJEFF It's probably nothing important -- just a little neighborhood murder, that's all. As a matter of fact, I did say \"murder\". \nStella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. She peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand. \nJEFF My only thought was to throw a little business your way. A good detective, I reasoned, would jump at the chance to detect. \nStella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes. \nJEFF Well, I usually took my best pictures on my day off. (nods) Okay, Doyle -- soon as you can. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nHe hangs up. Stella takes the phone and puts it down for him. He looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork. \nJEFF Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you. \nSTELLA Police? \nJEFF (Pauses in cutting food) Huh? \nSTELLA You called the police? \nJEFF Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. (Almost to himself) An old, ornery friend. \nHe begins eating, appreciatively. She moves behind his chair, pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment again. Jeff is just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when Stella speaks. \nSTELLA (Half to herself) Now just where do you suppose he cut her up? \nThe hand carrying the bacon to Jeff's mouth hesitates for a moment. \nSTELLA (Answering herself) Oh -- of course! In the bathtub. That's the only place he could wash away the blood. \nThe hand holding the bacon moves back to the plate. \nJeff just stares ahead. Stella turns and walks into the kitchen. Jeff pushes the food away, and picks up the coffee cup instead. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff's eyes, over the coffee cup, are staring intently at the backyard. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald's apartment. The shades up. No one moving. \nThe rope-tied trunk still sits in the bedroom. \nTo the left we see the basket lowering with the dog in it. We HEAR the woman WHISTLING an aria. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nHis eyes stray in an upward direction as he puts down the coffee cup. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe CAMERA PANS UP past the woman lowering the dog, up to the roof where one of the sunbathers can be seen sitting up, rubbing her body with sun tan oil. \n", "test1_true": "Jeff's eyes moves down again. Abstractedly his hand strays toward the piece of bacon. He picks it up. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald's apartment. We are now aware that the salesman is now in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting to ascend toward the ceiling of his room. \nStella's voice is heard calling out from the kitchen: \nSTELLA'S VOICE He'd better get that trunk out of there before is starts to leak. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nAgain the bacon stops before is reaches Jeff's mouth. \nHe puts it down on the plate again, as his eyes move slightly toward the left. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Torso, in ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash on a clothes line. It consists mostly of lingerie. She is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time. \nTHE CAMERA PANS OVER SUDDENLY TO Thorwald's apartment, and except for the smoke rising from the unseen sofa, there is no activity. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff seems to be getting a bit listless, or bored, by constantly watching Thorwald's apartment. His eyes sort of stray around the neighborhood, and end up looking toward: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe newlywed's apartment. Shade down, business as usual. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff smiles affectionately, and starts to turn his eyes away; but something startles him, and he looks quickly back. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe shade suddenly going up in the newlywed's apartment. \nThe young husband leans his hands on the windowsill, and looks out. He is wearing only his pajama bottoms, because of the heat, and we see that he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. He looks around with some satisfaction. He turns at the sound of a woman's voice behind him. \nGIRL'S VOICE H-a-a-r-r-e-e... \nHe turns his head, is thoughtful for a brief moment, then he pulls down the shade. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nHis smile almost becomes a private chuckle. Stella's abrupt voice breaks in urgently: \nSTELLA'S VOICE Look! Look -- Mr. Jefferies! \nJeff's head snaps toward the center of his window. \nStella has appeared behind his wheelchair. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nTwo men wearing tan coveralls are standing outside Thorwald's door. One of them carries a clipboard. \nSuddenly Thorwald is seen sitting up on the living room sofa. His hair is disheveled and he is unshaved. He stands up, and moves toward the door. \nHe opens it, and after a short exchange of dialogue, he admits the two men, leaving the door open behind them. \nHe leads the two man across the living room to the bedroom. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nStella and Jeff watching intently. He is feeling down alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT \nA close view shows the two man carrying the trunk across the living room toward the corridor. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff lowers the binoculars quickly. \nJEFF (Agitated) I thought Doyle would get here before the trunk went -- or I'd have called the police. (To Stella) Now we're going to lose it. \nStella moves toward the door quickly. Jeff turns quickly over his shoulder to watch her. She is already going up the steps. \nJEFF Stella, don't do anything reckless! \nAs Stella goes out the door, she calls back: \nSTELLA I'm just going to get the name of their truck! \nJEFF (Up) I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way. \nWe hear nothing from Stella, but the sound of her heavy tread down the hallway stairs. Jeff returns to Thorwald. He eases himself back into the shadows a bit and then raises his binoculars. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT \nJeff concentrates his attention on the alley-way that leads to the street. Just normal traffic. The binoculars swing to Thorwald apartment. The salesman is now at the telephone. He has picked up the receiver, and proceeds to dial 221. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nThe binoculars still up to Jeff's face. Under them his mouth moves, as if he's talking to himself. \nJEFF Long Distance. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - BINOCULAR SHOT \nThe salesman speaks some words to the operator. Placing the call. As he does this, he reaches with his other hand for a nearly bottle, and working the cork out with one hand, he pours a stiff drink into a tumbler. He drinks it as soon as he finishes talking with the operator. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff lowers the binoculars a little, and takes a normal eye sight on the alleyway. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - LONG SHOT \nPulling across to the far side of the street we see the hood and cab of a freight truck. \n", "test2_input": "The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into the garden, nonchalantly. Over this, we HEAR Lisa's voice, questioningly: \nLISA It doesn't seem to be in any hurry. \nJEFF (Stares out the window, exasperated) He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's -- \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nHe stops, turns to her quickly. \nJEFF That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost -- \nLISA What about it? \nJEFF He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone. \nLISA Someone not his wife? \nJEFF I never saw him ask her for advise before. (Smiles) But she volunteered plenty. \nJeff turns back to the window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his hand. Then he turns, puts his unfinished drink down on a table, and goes to the door. He puts the light out in the living room and goes out the door. He walks briskly down the corridor. \nLISA I wonder where he's going now? \nJEFF I don't know. \nLISA Suppose he doesn't come back again? \nJEFF He will. All his things are still piled on the bed. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa moves toward a nearby lamp. \nLISA Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now. \nJEFF (Looking to left) Not yet! \nHe picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection, as Lisa moves back to him. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CAMERA SHOT - NIGHT \nThe street intersection. Some traffic, mostly pedestrian. Miss Lonely Hearts still sitting at the cafe table, alone. Drinking. There is no sign of Thorwald. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nHe lowers the lens. \nJEFF He must have gone somewhere to the right. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the room. \nLISA All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work. \nJEFF Thinking about Thorwald? \nLISA (Nods yes) And you, and you friend Doyle -- (Stops, to Jeff) Did you hear from him again -- since he left? \nJEFF Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it. \nAs he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. \nJeff watches her. \nJEFF Something on your mind, Lisa? \nLISA It doesn't make sense to me. \nJEFF What doesn't? \nLISA Women aren't that unpredictable. \nJEFF (Losing a little patience) Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking. \nTHE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. Her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration. \nLISA A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why? \nJEFF Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag. \nTHE CAMERA eases back. \nLISA But only her husband would know that. (Starts to pace again) And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up. \nJEFF Do they hide it in their husband's clothes? \nLISA They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry. \nJEFF Inside stuff? \nLISA Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag. \nJEFF I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that. \nLISA That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband? \nJEFF That's what the witnesses told him. \nLISA Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women. \nJEFF Still -- those witnesses. \nLISA We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet. \nShe comes over to Jeff. He reaches up, takes her hand. \nJEFF Come here. \nHe pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek. \n", "test2_true": "JEFF Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though. \nLISA (Nuzzling Jeff) Don't rush me. We have all night. \nThere's a pause. Then Jeff moves back a little to look her straight in the eye. \nJEFF We have all -- what? \nLISA Night. I'm going to stay with you. \nJEFF You'll have to clear that through my landlord -- \nShe cuts him off with a kiss. When she pulls back \nLISA I have the whole weekend off. \nJEFF Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and -- \nLisa smothers him with another kiss. She lets up. \nLISA Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too. \nJEFF Lisa, I won't be able to give you any -- \nShe smothers him with still another kiss. Then moves back. \nJEFF -- pajamas. \nShe laughs, gets up. Goes to the large handbag on the table. Is is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case. \nLISA You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase (Picks up case) I'll bet yours isn't this small? \nJEFF That's a suitcase? \nLISA (Starting to open it) A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough. \nShe has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay. She comes to Jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the inside of the case \nLISA I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night. \nJEFF (Gives in smiling) I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse. \nThe SOUND from the party in the song-writer's apartment becomes more noticeable as his party grows. And at this point he begins playing the song he has been composing for the past few days. \nLISA There's that song again. \nShe gets up from Jeff's lap, and puts the overnight case on the table. Open. She goes to the window, and looks toward the song-writers' apartment. Jeff turns with her. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe party at the song-writer's has grow considerably larger. An assortment of well-dressed people have now crowded into the studio. They are drinking, eating, etc. At the moment, a number of them are crowded around the piano, listening to the composer's newest song -- which isn't quite completed. However, the melody has become more beautiful than ever. During the following scene, we HEAR the melody being played a number of different ways on the piano. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa stands, listening, entranced. \nLISA Where does a man get the inspiration for a song like that? \nJeff watches her. \nJEFF From his landlord -- once a month. \nLISA It's utterly beautiful. (Turns to Jeff) I wish I could be creative. \nJEFF You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations. \nLISA (Happily) I do? \nJEFF Staying the night here, uninvited. \nShe sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff. She leans toward him. \nLISA Surprise -- is the most important element of attack. (She smiles) And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it. \nJEFF The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich. \nLISA The same. \nJEFF But he never ends up marrying her. Strange. \nLISA (Stands up; deadpan) Weird. (She does a complete spin, then, ingenuously) Why don't I slip into something comfortable? \nJEFF You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee? \nLISA Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy. \nShe goes to the kitchen, humming with the song-writer's melody which we can HER off. Jeff turns back to the window, looks out. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nThe shade is going up in the newlyweds apartment. The young husband throws up the window an lights a cigarette. He takes a deep and satisfying drag on the cigarette, glancing toward the song-writer's party. \nJust as he starts to exhale the smoke, we HEAR his young wife's voice off: \nGIRL'S VOICE H-a-a-r-r-e-e-! \nHe chokes on the smoke, sputtering and coughing. When he recovers, he throws the cigarette down to the back-yard with a show of irritation. Then slowly he pulls the shade down. Behind us is SOUND of a door shutting \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nOver Jeff's shoulder we see Doyle coming down the steps slowly, and seemingly preoccupied. Jeff swings the chair around so that his back is to us. \nSEMI-CLOSEUP \nWithout looking at Jeff, Doyle comes into the apartment takes off his hat and places it on the table. He runs a hand over the side of his head and down the back of his neck, which seems to indicate some fatigue. \nSEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff. Looking expectantly at Doyle. \nSEMI CLOSEUP \n", "test3_input": "Jeff hangs up. Stella is now beginning to dig, carefully lifting the flowers off the center of the bed where they had dipped down. She places the flower plants on the sidewalk. Lisa stands facing Jeff's window and occasionally glances over her shoulder uneasily at Stella's work. \nAt this moment, the sounds of musical instruments begin to be heard from the songwriter's apartment. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT \nA little annoyed at the interruption, Jeff turns to look at the studio apartment. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nIn the songwriter's apartment, several of his musician friends have gathered. One plays a guitar, another a clarinet, and so on. One by one they try out the theme of the songwriter's new melody, running through it in turn to become familiar with the notes. We, therefore, hear the melody played informally in different ways with different instruments. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff shifts his eyes from the songwriter's apartment back to the courtyard. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nStella is busy, expertly handling the shovel. Lisa has her back to the nurse, but looks apprehensively over her shoulder. She then looks up toward Jeff's apartment. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff gives her an encouraging little gesture with his hand. Then his eyes lift a little as he looks up. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nMiss Lonely Hearts is sitting on the sofa, writing a note with a pad on her knee. Next to her, on the table, the pills are still in evidence. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the alleyway. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nThe alleyway and street intersection, with normal night traffic, but no sign of Thorwald. THE CAMERA LENS PANS across and down to the hole being dug by Stella. We get an impression of Lisa's legs as we go by. The spade comes out of the hole and rests on the side. THE CAMERA LENS PANS up just in time to catch Stella turning up to Jeff. She throws out a helpless hand and shakes her head. \"Nothing.\" \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff lowers the lens and looks down at the two women with evident disappointment. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nLisa glances up to Thorwald's apartment. She turns and gestures some instructions to Stella. Then she looks up at Jeff and gestures her intention to enter Thorwald's apartment. She turns and dashes toward Thorwald's fire escape as Stella makes a fruitless grab to restrain her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff, shocked and alarmed, calls out: \nJEFF Lisa -- no! \nHe looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to Lisa. Apparently no sight of Thorwald. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWhile Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nLisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment. \nShe tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT \nJeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the salesman's apartment. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nLisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Nothing falls out. Empty. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nHe lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself: \nJEFF Come on. Come on! Get out of there! \nHis eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nLisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them. \nShe finds nothing. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nAs Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment. \nSTELLA Ring Thorwald's phone the second you see him on the way back! \nJeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone. \nJEFF I'm going to ring him now! \nAs he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again. \nSTELLA Give her another minute -- She's doing this for you. \nStella looks out the window and her face registers shock. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. \nSTELLA Miss Lonely Hearts! \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nMiss Lonely Hearts is in the act of popping an envelope up against the table lamp on the table next to the sofa. \nFrom the same table, she takes a pill bottle and empties the contents into her left hand.

NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nAt the bottom of the picture, Miss Lonely Hearts is still listening to the music, while in the apartment above Lisa appears into the living room from behind the doorway that leads to the bedroom. She looks across to the source of the music. She is as arrested by the melody as Miss Lonely Hearts. Then looking across to Jeff, she holds up her hands triumphantly to show him the jewelry she has discovered. At this point, Thorwald appears coming along the corridor of his apartment house! Lisa is completely unaware of his approach. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nStella is so shocked, she can only gasp for breath. \nJeff, in near panic, shouts in anguish! \nJEFF Lisa! Lisa! \nAt this moment, the phone is picked up on filter, and a voice speaks: \nPOLICE Precinct Six -- Sergeant Allgood. \nJeff opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out, as his attention is focused on: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald at the door, unlocking it with his key. We see that Lisa has heard the sound, and looks toward the door, all but frozen with alarm.

NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThorwald crosses the living room, and goes into the bedroom. Suddenly he looks onto the bed. He picks up the open alligator handbag. He turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment. \nHe comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in. \nHe points to the window. She makes one more step toward the door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands something from Lisa. \nSlowly her right hand comes up and opens. \nHe takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out faintly: \"Jeff! Jeff!\" \nThorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nAn angry Jeff is staring, and trying to penetrate the semi- darkness of Thorwald's room. Then he bends his head forward in despair, and after a brief moment speaks: \nJEFF (With deep sincerity) Stella -- what can we do? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nStella staring out, tense, frightened. Then her expression changes sharply as she looks slightly to the left. \nSTELLA There they are. \nJeff looks up quickly. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nTwo policemen move quickly and professionally up the corridor toward Thorwald's apartment. They stop at the door, listen a moment, and then push the buzzer insistently. Inside the apartment, lights go on, and Thorwald is in the center of the room looking toward the door. Lisa staggers away from him, trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair. She is as surprised at the interruption as Thorwald. He listens, looks back questioningly toward Lisa, then goes to the door. He passes into the kitchen. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff and Stella visibly relax. Jeff doesn't say anything, but a gesture of rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand gives an indication of how deep his tension was. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nAfter a moment's hesitation, Thorwald goes to the door and opens it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff quickly puts a hand out and takes up his long-focus lens. He looks through the finder. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nThorwald's head and shoulders fill the screen. For a moment Thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police. We see him listening to the policeman out of the picture. Thorwald turns slowly and we see him lose much of his fright and regain some control of his face. He completes his turn and is looking at the girl a little puzzled. He then swings back toward the police. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nA quick flash of Jeff and Stella looking.

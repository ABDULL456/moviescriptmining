{"test1_input": "JEFF It's worse than the Chinese water torture. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe now see the source of the piano music. It comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. The short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. He continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear-catching. \nIt is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment. \nHe stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc. \nHe takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. He then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff frowns at the double sound, and raises his voice a little. He continues the conversation which has been heard all through the previous scene. \nGUNNISON Read some good books. \nJEFF I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore. \nGUNNISON I'll send you some comic books. \nJEFF (Low, tense) Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic. \nGUNNISON Like what? \nJEFF (On filter) I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere. \nGUNNISON It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. \nJEFF Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife. \nGUNNISON Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss. \nJefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees: \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house. \nThe brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. \nOn the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well- muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nWith his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. \nJEFF Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag. \nGUNNISON Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff. \nJEFF Next time, have some good news. \nHe hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nJeff shifts his look more to the right. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThe man enters the bedroom. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. Pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as \"You should have been home two hours ago! I could be lying here dying for all you'd know -- or care!\" The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. \nHe shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. \nBack in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. It gives no relief. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nWe see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. \nThey are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. Finally, he waters them. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nInto the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. \nShe wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter. She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. \nHer skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation. No sooner has she settled into her chair, than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He notices her, but doesn't speak. \nShe begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. \nBehind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. \nSTELLA McGAFFERY comes in. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark- haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. She carries a small black bag. \nStella pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. He doesn't appear to notice her entrance. \nSTELLA (Loud) The New York State sentence for a peeping Tom is six months in the workhouse! \nHe doesn't turn. \nJEFF Hello Stella. \nAs she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand: \n", "test1_true": "She puts her bag down on a table. It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. She takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair. \nSTELLA Years ago, they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker. Is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker? \nHe doesn't answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. She talks as she works. \nSTELLA We've grown to be a race of peeping Toms. What people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once in a while. (She looks up at him) What do you think of that for homespun philosophy? \nA look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it. \nJEFF Readers' Digest, April, 1939. \nSTELLA Well, I only quote from the best. \nShe takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. Looks at it. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff. \nShe swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff starts to protest. \nJEFF Now look, Stella -- \nShe shoves the thermometer into his mouth. \nSTELLA See it you can break a hundred. \nAs she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it. Talking, all the time. \nSTELLA I shoulda been a Gypsy fortune teller, instead of an insurance company nurse. I got a nose for trouble -- can smell it ten miles away. (Stops, looks at him) You heard of the stock market crash in '29? \nJeff nods a bored \"yes.\" \nSTELLA I predicted it. \nJEFF (Around thermometer) How? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nStella stops for a moment, and looks at Jeff challengingly. \nSTELLA Simple. I was nursing a director of General Motors. Kidney ailment they said. Nerves, I said. Then I asked myself -- what's General Motors got to be nervous about? (Snaps her fingers) Overproduction. Collapse, I answered. When General Motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day -- the whole country's ready to let go. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nA patient, suffering look comes over his face. He takes out the thermometer. \nJEFF Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none. \nSTELLA It crashed, didn't it? \nJeff has no answer. Defeated, he puts the thermometer back into his mouth. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSEUP \nStella goes on with her work. \nSTELLA I can smell trouble right in this apartment. You broke your leg. You look out the window. You see things you shouldn't. Trouble. I can see you now, in front of the judge, flanked by lawyers in blue double- breasted suits. You're pleading, \"Judge, it was only innocent fun. I love my neighbors like a father.\" -- The Judge answers, \"Congratulations. You just gave birth to three years in Dannemora.\" \nTHE CAMERA PANS HER over to him. She takes out the thermometer, looks at it. \nJEFF Right now I'd even welcome trouble. \nSTELLA (Flatly) You've got a hormone deficiency. \nJEFF How can you tell that from a thermometer! \nSTELLA Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks. \nShe gets down the thermometer. Sterilizes it with a piece of alcohol-soaked cotton in her other hand. \nShe gets behind the wheelchair the CAMERA PULLS back as she pushes it over to the divan. She puts the thermometer away in its case. Then she helps him off with his pajama top. She helps him stand on one foot. \nHe hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DAY - CLOSE SHOT \nThe CAMERA is very low at one end of the divan. Jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the fore-ground. \nBeyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking. \nJEFF I think you're right. There is going to be some trouble around here. \nStella takes a handful of oil, slaps it on his back. He winces. \nSTELLA I knew it! \nJEFF Don't you ever heat that stuff up. \nSTELLA Gives your circulation something to fight. (Begins massaging his back) What kind of trouble? \nJEFF Lisa Fremont. \nSTELLA You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood. \nJEFF She expects me to marry her. \nSTELLA That's normal. \nJEFF I don't want to. \nSTELLA (Slaps cold oils on him) That's abnormal. \nJEFF (Wincing) I'm not ready for marriage. \nSTELLA Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open. \nJEFF (Indifferent) She's all right. \nShe hits him with some more cold oil. He winces again. \n", "test1_id": 1209, "test2_input": "EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nWe get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. Whoever he has called answers. And instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. He relaxes, smiles, is warm. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. In the bedroom, his wife has become aware of the call. \nQuietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. The wall hides her from our view. \nThen suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone, and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. She climbs in bed laughing. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen and has another drink. He stands there, controlling an outburst of emotion, and seems almost to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nWhile Jeff has been engaged in watching this little drama, the SOUND of a piano has started. He now diverts his attention from the salesman's apartment to the source of the piano music. He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's apartment. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nThrough the studio window of the song-writer's apartment we see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is farther along the line of the melody than before. \nIt is beginning to take some shape, and give promise of its full beauty. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff, listening to the composer. His head turns as Lisa's voice comes over: \nLISA (Emerging from kitchen) Where's that music coming from? \nTHE CAMERA QUICKLY PULL BACK as Jeff swings his chair around. Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor. \nJEFF Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage. \nLISA (Putting down the food) I think it's enchanting. \nShe pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table. We now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. \nLISA Almost as if it were being written especially for us. \nJEFF (Pleasantly) No wonder he's having so much trouble with it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nA faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. \nLISA Well, at least you can't say the dinner isn't right. \nINT.

JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nShooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan- bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. There is one light burning, behind Lisa's head. A fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body and legs. \nLISA There can't be that much difference between people and the way they live! We all eat, talk, drink, laugh, sleep, wear clothes -- \nJeff raises both his hands. \nJEFF Well now, look -- \nLisa draws back one leg, and points a finger challengingly. \nLISA If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand -- \nJEFF There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that -- \nLISA (Won't let him break in) It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily? \nJEFF Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain -- \nLISA (Ignores him) What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation. \nJEFF All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but -- \nLISA It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nJeff begin to get desperate. \nJEFF I made a simple, but true statement and I'll back it up, if you'll just shut up for a minute! \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nLisa, stretched out on the divan. She looks at him for a moment without speaking. Then: \nLISA If your opinion is as rude as your manner, I'm not sure I want to hear it. \nWe see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture. \nJEFF (Soothing her) Lisa, simmer down -- will you? \nLISA (Something starts her up again) You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same -- \nJEFF (Loud, sharp) Lisa! Shut up! \nLisa turns on her side, and stares into the room, angrily. \nINT.

Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining (Squints at her) Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive! \nLISA Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong. \nJEFF If anything, I'm making it sound good. (A thoughtful pause) Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are. \nINT.

She moves away from THE CAMERA into the center of the room, as she says: \nLISA (Wearily) No. I don't particularly want that. (She turns, faces him) So that's it.

He turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment. \nHe comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in. \nHe points to the window. She makes one more step toward the door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands something from Lisa. \nSlowly her right hand comes up and opens. \nHe takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out faintly: \"Jeff! Jeff!\" \nThorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nAn angry Jeff is staring, and trying to penetrate the semi- darkness of Thorwald's room. Then he bends his head forward in despair, and after a brief moment speaks: \nJEFF (With deep sincerity) Stella -- what can we do? \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nStella staring out, tense, frightened. Then her expression changes sharply as she looks slightly to the left. \nSTELLA There they are. \nJeff looks up quickly. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nTwo policemen move quickly and professionally up the corridor toward Thorwald's apartment. They stop at the door, listen a moment, and then push the buzzer insistently. Inside the apartment, lights go on, and Thorwald is in the center of the room looking toward the door. Lisa staggers away from him, trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair. She is as surprised at the interruption as Thorwald. He listens, looks back questioningly toward Lisa, then goes to the door. He passes into the kitchen. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT \nJeff and Stella visibly relax. Jeff doesn't say anything, but a gesture of rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand gives an indication of how deep his tension was. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \nAfter a moment's hesitation, Thorwald goes to the door and opens it. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP \nJeff quickly puts a hand out and takes up his long-focus lens. He looks through the finder. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - CAMERA SHOT \nThorwald's head and shoulders fill the screen. For a moment Thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police. We see him listening to the policeman out of the picture. Thorwald turns slowly and we see him lose much of his fright and regain some control of his face. He completes his turn and is looking at the girl a little puzzled. He then swings back toward the police. \nINT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP \nA quick flash of Jeff and Stella looking. Jeff still has the long-focus lens to his eye. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT \n", "test3_id": 1211}

FADE IN 
ON A RINGING TELEPHONE. 
A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of CASEY BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face with innocent eyes. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN'S VOICE (from phone) Hello. 
Silence. 
CASEY Yes. 
MAN Who is this? 
CASEY Who are you trying to reach? 
MAN What number is this? 
CASEY What number are you trying to reach? 
MAN I don't know. 
CASEY I think you have the wrong number. 
MAN Do I? 
CASEY It happens. Take it easy. 
CLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Casey in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to the kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent. 
The phone RINGS again. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
Casey grabs the portable. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. 
CASEY So why did you dial it again? 
MAN To apologize. 
CASEY You're forgiven. Bye now. 
MAN Wait, wait, don't hang up. 
Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black outside. 
CASEY What? 
MAN I want to talk to you for a second. 
CASEY They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. 
CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face. 
EXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING 
A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees.  It sits alone with no neighbors in sight. 
The phone RINGS again. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a lid, reaching for the portable phone. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN Why don't you want to talk to me? 
CASEY Who is this? 
MAN You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. 
CASEY (shaking the popcorn) I don't think so. 
MAN What's that noise? 
Casey smiles, playing along, innocently. 
CASEY Popcorn. 
MAN You're making popcorn?

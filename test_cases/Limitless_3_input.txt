MALE VOICE Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital... (VOICE QUAKING) ...and he's really sick. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE Oh my God. What's wrong with him? 
MALE VOICE We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Eddie turns to the last page of Vernon's book. 
EDDIE (V.O.) Of all the people I called, three were dead, and the rest were sick. 
Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white. 
The man takes out his cell phone and answers. 
MAN'S VOICE Hello...? Hello...? 
The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and follows. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY 
Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly can. 
He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He can't run fast. 
Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling. 
EDDIE (V.0.) In the end, my stupidity saved me. 
Eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk. 
EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK 
is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it -- then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it. When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of- 
EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK 
disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a crowd. 
TAN COAT 
hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given him the slip. This time. 
INT. CHARLIE'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Eddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously. 
EDDIE (V.0.) What was I dealing with? Who could tell me? I hoped against hope... that Melissa would show. 
EDDIE'S POV - SCANNING THE PLACE 
Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs. Turns to go. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Eddie...? 
Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick- waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her... and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock on his face. 
EDDIE Melissa...? 
He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years. 
Eddie tries to conceal his shock. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EDDIE (CONT'D) You... how are you doing? 
Melissa responds with a cynical shrug. Then, she eyes him. 
MELISSA Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way... (BEAT) You look good. 
EDDIE I guess I lost some weight... 
MELISSA Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you. 
They regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start. Old emotions. New emotions. Shock. Dismay. Affection. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on. 
Eddie doesn't know what to say. 
EDDIE Since when do you read the Post? 
MELISSA These days, the Post's about all I can read.

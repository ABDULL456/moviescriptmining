BRIAN Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning. 
Brian shuts off his shower and walks out. 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM 
Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained and ruined back. He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee. 
On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia through the years. There's a two battered fire helmets there, set reverently on velvet. Beside it is a photograph of his father. Grinning. Top of the world. He's wearing a T-shirt proudly stenciled FIGHTING 17th. 
Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting. 
In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man. 
The ALARM KLAXON suddenly sounds. Brian, just in a towel and Tim, in boxers covered with little dinosaurs, dash for the fire pole. 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR 
Tim and Brian slide down and bounce off the floor. 
GRINDLE -- C'mon! C'mon! Go! Go! 
Brian and Tim rush for their equipment. Grindle grabs their arms. 
GRINDLE No! C'mon! This way! 
He hustles them across the apparatus floor, through a doorway, and into the kitchen. 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN/DINING AREA 
The makings of a meal are laid out on the counter. Brian and Tim come to a screeching halt. The rest of the station is sitting calmly at the kitchen table, watching. 
BRIAN What's going on? 
PENGELLY Dinner, Probies. Get started. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN 
Tim and Brian, still in their boxers, set down plates of food. 
STEPHEN Better be good. 
SANTOS Or we feed you to The Thing. 
Everybody digs in. The table is a craze of half a dozen different conversations. On the TV mounted above on the wall are news shots of Seagrave's body sticking out of the windshield. 
Adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence. 
AXE Gentlemen, please... As 17's official toastmaster -- 
SANTOS And bullshitter. 
AXE Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to mention that you were cut out of my will? (company laughs) I think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes -- I mean probationary firemen -- among us who today were baptized officially into the world of Old Man Fire. First to Tim, who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears, not only took on the beast but pulled from its clutches -- assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter -- me -- a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail. (laughs) And to Brian, who's own contribution was both more beautiful and less likely to sue. 
Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin, seated with honor at the head of the table. Right beside The Thing. 
AXE Y'know, when I heard that both McCaffrey brothers were going to be assigned together here, well, my heart was filled with... a sudden desire to transfer. (laughs) So raise a glass, lads. To funny- looking Tim, and the McCaffrey brothers, who despite years of getting on each other's nerves have managed with great effort... to still be pissed off at each other. Gentlemen! 
COMPANY (together, a toast) Fuck you! 
The klaxon suddenly rings. Two bells. The ladder guys groan and get up. 
STEPHEN Bye, boys. 
SCHMIDT (winks) We'll keep it warm for you. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM 
Dawn lightens the room as Brian slowly opens his eyes and sees in extreme, fish-eyes close-up: THE THING GROWLING at him. Brian turns the other direction and sees Stephen, fully dressed, standing over his bunk. 
STEPHEN Clean the toilets. 
INT. APPARATUS FLOOR 
Bleary-eyed, the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of their rigs, dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps they wear only at this moment. Stephen stands before them, does a quick glance up and down the line. 
STEPHEN Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya guys tonight at Fitzgerald's retirement party. 
They shuffle for the door. As Brian passes, 
STEPHEN You want a ride? 
EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
Stephen pulls up. Brian opens the door.

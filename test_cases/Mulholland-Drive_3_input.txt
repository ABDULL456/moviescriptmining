EXT.  NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS, LOS ANGELES 
Darkness. Distant sounds of freeway traffic. Then the closer sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree. Then the headlights turn - a street sign is suddenly brightly lit. The words on the sign read... "Mulholland Drive." The car moves under the sign as it turns and the words fall once again into darkness. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE 
Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine - as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the darkness of the Hollywood Hills. There is no one else on the road. As we drift closer to the car... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. A beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. She sits close up against the door and stares out into the darkness. She seems to be thinking about something. Suddenly she turns and looks ahead. The car is slowing and moving off to the side of the road. 
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN What are you doing? You don't stop here ... 
The car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind curve. Both men turn to the woman. 
DRIVER Get out of the car. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT 
Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the Cadillac limousine. The cars are filled with crazed teenagers. Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back. 
The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of Mulholland Drive. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EXT. - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE 
The driver, still in his seat, has a pistol with a silencer attached pointing at the woman. The other man is getting out of the car. The woman is clutching the seat and the door handle as if trying to anchor herself. She is visibly afraid. The man who got out of the car tries the woman's door, but it is locked. He smiles as he reaches in through the front door and unlocks her door. He opens her door. As he reaches for her, the woman's face becomes flooded with light. Her eyes dart to the front windshield. The driver, flooded with light, turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac limousine. There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in death. The convertible screams past with hardly a notice. The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is jettisoned through the windshield. The other man is torn as the cars screech over him. The woman is brutally thrown into the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying rocks engulfs her. The disastrous moving sculpture of the two cars wants to climb up the hill, then stops and slides back toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side. Then all is silent. A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we see the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the road. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above her forehead. She stands for a moment clutching her purse - lost , then begins to walk as if in a trance across Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT 
The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile desert plants. Sirens can be heard in the distance. She crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a coyote which snarls and leaps at her. She screams and strikes out with her purse in self defense. The coyote backs away - snarling. The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote and it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. She gets up and stumbles through the trees. When she clears them she is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down below. She clumsily starts down toward it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT 
The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at Franklin Avenue. A car races by and its headlights flare on her face. Her expression shows fear and panic. She doesn't know where she is or where to go. She runs frantically across the street. She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her into a residential area. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT 
The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard. Coming up Sunset in the distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going. She hurries into the darkness of another residential area. A car turns onto the street and comes toward her. She instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes.

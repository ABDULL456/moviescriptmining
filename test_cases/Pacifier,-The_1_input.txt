The bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back. He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall... 
SHANE All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this. 
A piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head. 
TODD Can I get by? 
Embarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters- 
SHANE Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened. 
Shane SNAPS it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall, patrolling. Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. She stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane. 
ZOE He has to go. 
Todd nods in agreement. 
INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - LATER S hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer. His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the rumble of a car approaching. 
L 
S 
He rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and opens it, just as -- WHACK -- the MORNING PAPER connects with his face, hard. From off-screen we hear a PAPERBOY. 
PAPERBOY (O.S.) SORRY DUDE! 
Shane rubs his nose. Lulu screams at the top of her lungs. Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her, wearing a towel as a sheet. He pretends to be a ghost. 
PETER Whhhoooooo! 
LULU Stop it, Peter! 
Lulu hides behind Shane. Peter Booos again. Lulu screams. 
SHANE Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything. 
LULU This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost. 
And then it hits Shane.       His eyes light up. 
SHANE Really?   And where is this ghost? 
ULU I don't know.     I've never seen it. 
INT. HALLWAY - LATER 
Shane walks slowly down the hall. As he walks he glides his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the ceiling. Searching. I INT. STAIRWAY - SAME TIME 
Todd and Zoe kneel on the stairs. They surreptitiously pour COOKING OIL all over the wood. 
Then -- a creak. Zoe whispers. 
ZOE Here he comes...! 
Zoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch. 
F 
Shane strides to the top step and RAPS on the wall. He RAPS again, listening for hollow spaces. Nothing. Shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down... 
When he hears an alert from his laptop. He goes back to the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop. MR. Chun's photo appears next to a VEHICLE REGISTRATION. Shane scans it... 
Todd and Zoe's faces fall. The footsteps again- 
TODD He's coming back- 
But Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes a step onto the stairs -- 
HELGA AHHH!!! 
BUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs, BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down. 
inally, BAM! Helga HITS the bottom with a mighty crash. She screams, as laundry flutters down from above. T IGHT - ZOE AND TODD 
They gulp, terrified. 
ZOE Uh-oh. 
EXT. SWISS BANK - DAY

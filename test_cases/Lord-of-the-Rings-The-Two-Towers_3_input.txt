[At the Ent Moot] 
TREEBEARD The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done. 
MERRY How can that be your decision?! 
TREEBEARD This is not our war. 
MERRY But you're part of this world! Arent you?! [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please! You must do something! 
TREEBEARD You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home. 
[Merry is putting on his jacket. Pippin approaches him slowly] 
PIPPIN Maybe Treebeards right. We dont belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home. 
MERRY [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin. 
[Pippin looks after Merry as he walks away.] 
GAMLING Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there! 
ARAGORN Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad! (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep! Haldir, to the Keep!) 
[Haldir nods and turns back. Gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes] 
GIMLI [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh! What are you stopping for! 
[HALDIR HACKS AT A FEW URUK AS HE TURNS TOWARDS THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.] 
With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead Uruk-hai.] 
ARAGORN [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldirs side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.] 
GAMLING Brace the gate! 
SOLDIER Hold them! 
THÉODEN [Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw your swords! 
[Théoden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack. The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood. Théoden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour. Grimacing in pain, Théoden continues to stab at the Uruk until led away by Gamling.] 
GAMLING Make way! We cannot hold much longer. 
THÉODEN Hold them! 
ARAGORN [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need? 
GAMLING Brace the gate! 
THÉODEN As long as you can give me! 
ARAGORN Gimli! 
THEODEN Timbers! Brace the Gate! 
[Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming the gate.]

The PUNTERS who are cleaned out get off their chairs, tear up their sequence cards, turn and walk away, quickly, slowly. 
ON JACK'S FACE: 
JACK'S VOICE Without emotion he watched them go. Jake stayed. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT 
MARION is lying awake alone in bed. The phone rings. She leans over to pick it up, then doesn't. From the sitting room comes the message: 
JANI'S VOICE It's set. The day after tomorrow. The twenty-fourth. Good luck. 
Click. MARION gets out of bed. She goes into the sitting room. 
INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 
MARION replays the message. She stares at the phone. Then carefully she presses the ERASE button, wiping the message. She goes back into the bedroom. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY 
JACK is at work. MARION'S hands are massaging his shoulders. The little book charm dangles round his neck. 
MARION Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? 
JACK (looks up) Never. Why do you ask? 
MARION I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time... 
JACK Gambling's not about money. 
MARION Really? 
JACK Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds. 
She takes her hands away from his neck. 
MARION I must be a fool. I never think about the odds. 
The sound of an underground train. 
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 
JACK sits impassively among noisy Christmas TRAVELLERS. The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the crowd. 
INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT 
JACK hangs up his hat and coat, examines himself in the mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it. A Christmas party hat. 
JACK'S VOICE Chapter Twelve... 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
A Christmas festive atmosphere. The casino interior is decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold streamers, a large tree hung with £1000 chips. 
JACK is dealing at a blackjack table. Like the other croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat. 
The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind them. They are gambling big money. Wads of £50 notes are changed into £100 chips. 
JACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the box beneath the table. 
REYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a short break the money is taken from under the table in a box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away. 
INT. CASINO - BAR - NIGHT 
TWO COLD-LOOKING MEN in suits are drinking mineral water at the bar. They watch the SECURITY MAN with the cart pass by and disappear through a green baize door marked PRIVATE. One of the SUITS looks at his watch: five minutes to midnight. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch: 2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy, laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him. The SUIT throws him £500. 
SUIT Fifties. Ten of them. 
JACK What colour chips?

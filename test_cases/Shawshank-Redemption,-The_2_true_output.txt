54	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 54 
Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket. 
RED (V.O.) More than a hundred men volunteered for the job. 
Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters discreetly in his ear. 
55	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 55 
Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red exchanges grins with Andy and the others. 
RED (V.O.) Wouldn't you know it? Me and some fellas I know were among the names called. 
56	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 56 
Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes. 
RED (V.O.) Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made my usual twenty percent, of course. 
57	EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57 
A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 
58 	THE ROOF 58 
-- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: 
HADLEY ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died. 
YOUNGBLOOD Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 
HADLEY I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get. 
TROUT A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You get any of that? 
HADLEY Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me. 
TROUT Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! Like winnin' a lottery... (off Hadley's shitty look) ...ain't it? 
HADLEY Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 
TROUT Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 
HADLEY Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride... 
MERT And drive it, if they're old enough. 
HADLEY That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. (spits over the side) Some brother. Shit. 
The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 
HEYWOOD Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' luck. Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars. 
RED Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad. 
Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up, listening to the guards talk. 
RED Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail! 
Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley. 
RED Andy! Come back! Shit! 
SNOOZE What's he doing? 
FLOYD Gettin' himself killed. 
RED God damn it... 
HEYWOOD Just keep spreadin' tar... 
The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. 
ANDY Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 
HADLEY That's funny. You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth. 
ANDY What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you? 
HADLEY That's it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 
Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.

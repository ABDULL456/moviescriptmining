JOE (controls fury) What you got in your pockets? 
Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway token, a dirty handkerchief. Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a watch. 
JOE (CONT'D) How much's that worth? 
FAT BOY I can't go home without my watch! My mother'd die! She'd die! Take my books! Not my watch! She'd die! 
But Joe has already kicked open the door. Theremin voices drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?" 
INT. ALL NIGHT MOVIE - NIGHT 
Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail, the radio at his ear. On screen, once again, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio. As she speaks, a policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his night stick. 
DESPERATE VOICE Bill, can I call you Bill, Mister Bonner? I feel like I know you from listening. What I called about, Bill, I'm gonna kill myself... 
EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY 
From a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen above a passing bus, its side panel advertising BILL BONNER'S STRAIGHT LINE, A STRAIGHT TALK SHOW. 
BONNER'S VOICE Why call me, baby? If you want to do it; just do it, don't talk about it. Are we drunky? Feeling a little sorry for ourselves maybe? 
Joe appears in full figure as the bus passes. He stands looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window. 
DESPERATE VOICE Well, Bill, what I got thinking, I didn't want the neighbors to have to find me, this young couple with the boy I want to have my cat, see, Bill? 
INT. RADIO STATION - DAY 
BONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone. 
BONNER Okay, baby, now listen, just hold on while I leave the line for a minute. And think about all the kids that are dying overseas for you, okay, baby? Got that? I'll be back in exactly sixty seconds. After this message from... 
A taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message. 
EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - DAY 
Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street toward... 
EXT. NEDICK'S - DAY 
... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic -- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend... 
INT. NEDICK'S - DAY 
... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath. 
RATSO Don't hit me, I'm a cripple. 
Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder. 
JOE Oh, I ain't gonna hit you, I'm gonna strangle you to death... 
The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip. He jerks spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup. 
JOE (CONT'D) ... only first I'm gonna turn you upside down and shake you out right here and now. 
Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer. 
JOE What's in your socks? 
RATSO Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes. 
Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the counter man. His socks don't even conceal his toes. Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him. 
RATSO (CONT'D) You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.

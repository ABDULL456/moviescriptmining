{"test1_input": "INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nJulian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat. He is alone. He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare... We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the table... Light up and begins to smoke morphine... He walks to the window and looks out over Bangkok... His phone rings - Julian answers... \nJULIAN \n(ON THE PHONE) Hello? \nJENNA (V.O.) It's me... \nJULIAN \n(ON THE PHONE) Hi Mum. Where are you? \nJENNA (V.O.)

FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / BAR \nJenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace. She holds on to him. A little too long. Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time. \nJENNA Could it be have been one of the gangs? \nJULIAN Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't popular. \nJENNA What do you mean? \nJULIAN You know Billy... He was eccentric. Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment. \nJENNA But you're going to find out who did it, right? \nJULIAN I'll make sure it gets done. \nJENNA No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying? \nJULIAN Yeah, okay, I'll do it. \nJENNA Good.

The taste of love is sweet When hearts like ours meet I fell for you like a child Oh, but the fire went wild.

SLUMS - DAY \nA Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's. In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling, a daughter either side of him. His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the road. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S KIOSK - DAY \nJulian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. Waiting. Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face. On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam. We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's selling. They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting for Choi Yan Lee to turn up. Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching... Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor. Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket. The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into the kiosk that doubles as their home. Julian and his men close in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK \nAs Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED \nSHUT. They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk, followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian. Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in the air. \nCHOI YAN LEE \n(IN THAI) You can't kill me. I'm a cripple. \nKIM YAN LEE \n(IN THAI) Who are you? What do you think you're doing? Get out or we'll call the police. Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to Charlie Ling. \nJULIAN Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee. At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's face. His eyes lock with Julian's. \nCHARLIE LING \n(IN THAI) Is your name Choi Yan Lee? Choi Yan Lee nods his head. \nJULIAN Ask him why he killed my brother. \nCHARLIE LING \n(IN THAI) You killed his brother. Big mistake fat man. Why'd you do it? Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught... \nCHOI YAN LEE \n(IN THAI) He murdered my daughter. \n", "test1_id": 1965, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. BOXING CLUB - DAY \nJulian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over, strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to him, watching the sparring fighters... Julian stares at him... Turns back to the cops... \nJULIAN Good morning officers. How can I help you? Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's in a trance... \nKIM We're investigating the murder of Choi Yan Lee. Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs. \nJULIAN Never heard of him. \nKIM His arm was cut off. Here. Julian manages to cover his reaction. \nJULIAN I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men. A beat. Mexican stand off. \nJULIAN (CONT'D) What's this got to do with me? \nKIM He was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother. \nJULIAN Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me... \nKIM That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If you could just answer our questions. \nJULIAN Sure, sorry. What do you want to know? Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers. The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted. \nKIM Where were you last night? \nJULIAN With my mum... Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian like they're bowing down before a God. \nJULIAN (CONT'D) You want to speak to her? \nKIM That wont be necessary at the moment. \nJULIAN Am I suspect? Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long moment and then turns to Kim. \nCHANG \n(IN THAI) This is not the man. And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves. The cops back off and away. ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him. \nJULIAN I want you to find out who that guy is. Okay? \nGORDON Sure. No problem. \nJULIAN Now. The SOUND of Nadee singing 'LONELY COMING DOWN' by Dolly Parton. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KARAOKE BAR \nChang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink. Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him. \nCHANG Why are you here? \nJULIAN You're him... Aren't you? \nCHANG Who? \nJULIAN The one who killed my brother. Chang says nothing for a long time. \nCHANG I love all living things. Beat. \nCHANG (CONT'D) I restore karma.

And maybe he wont be so lucky as last time. \nDAENG \n(IN THAI) Then why's he going to fight the Westerner? The question hangs in the air. It's what they're all wondering. \nPHAIBUN He used to be a great boxer. \nKIM He has to do it. Since he came out of the coma, that's what he's done. Whatever's been asked of him, he's done it. He can't help it. It's all a mystery... A mutual pause. \nDAENG And if he loses? \nPHAIBUN He can't lose. He's the Angel of Vengeance. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Nadee detects the change in him. \n", "test2_id": 1966, "test3_input": "CHANG (CONT'D) You're innocent. \nJULIAN What are you talking about? \nCHANG It's not your fault. Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him. He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in his mind. It's not his fault. Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left, right. Julian just takes them... Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring. Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick - - which makes contact with Julian's draw. SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact. He's out cold before he hits the floor. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT \nJenna hurries down the corridor. She reaches the dressing room door.

Jenna hugs Mai close. \nJENNA (CONT'D) We'll get him through this together. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT \nJulian turns when he hears a knock at the door. Says nothing. Jenna enters and closes the door behind her. She stands there for a moment as if considering what to say... \nJENNA You deserved to win. You should've \nWON-- \nJULIAN Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest. He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him. \nJENNA I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win. \nJULIAN Yeah, well I lost. \nJENNA And did it make a difference? Julian says nothing. \nJENNA (CONT'D) I want to know... Did it make a difference? Slowly he shakes his head. \nJULIAN ... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all. \nJENNA And how do you feel now? \nJULIAN Nothing. I don't feel anything at all. \nJENNA Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died...

He knows it was me. \nJULIAN Who does? Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks... Cogs turn... \nJULIAN (CONT'D) Chang? Jenna nods. \nJULIAN (CONT'D) What did you do, Mum? What did you do? Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless. \nJENNA He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you. Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone. \nJENNA (CONT'D) I'm scared, Julian. Julian stares at his mother. \nJENNA (CONT'D) What are we going to do? Julian begins to realize what he has to do... and he looks at his hands. Finally... \nJULIAN We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out... \nJENNA Not just him. We've got to take them all out. Julian stares at her - the power she has over him... \nJENNA (CONT'D) Kill them all. The final solution. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

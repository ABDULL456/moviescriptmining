(to Sibyl) 
Can his power be taken? 
SIBYL 
The bird is the key, the life-force that flows within it... 
JUDAH 
(UNDERSTANDING) 
The blood of the Crow. 
Judah whirls around, his eyes glowing with a manic fervor. 
JUDAH 
(to Curve) 
The tattoo on your chest, who gave it to you? 
CURVE 
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle, but what's that got to do with... 
Judah grips Curve's shoulders tightly, shaking him. 
JUDAH 
Everything, you idiot! Find her. If she gave you his mark, then she's connected to him in some way. She can lead us to him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - DAWN 
Ashe stands at the end of the pier, staring down into the silent waters where his natural life ended. He takes something from his coat... 
THE PAINTING 
which Danny had been working on. It's got bullet holes in it now. 
Ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens, SCREAMING, cursing his fate. 
ON ASHE, 
as seen from afar. A tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse of ocean and sky. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRAY GARGOYLE TATTOO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 
SUPER TITLE: 
"NOVEMBER 1ST - NOCHE DE LOS MUERTOS" 
Curve and Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs - even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut. Curve lets Noah thrash a moment, then violently rips the tape from Noah's face. 
NOAH 
(frightened, gasping) 
Look, what do you people want? 
CURVE 
A house in the country, a dog, a wife and two kids... 
(GRINS) 
...your fucking head stapled to my saddlebags. 
KALI 
We're looking for Sarah. Where is she, Noah? 
NOAH 
I'm not going to tell you that... 
KALI 
Oh, but I think you are... 
Kali sites astride Noah. She reaches for one of the tattoo machines. She motions to Curve, who hits the treadlight foot switch. Noah eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as Kali moves it towards his face. 
CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE 
a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from Noah's blinking eye. Noah tries to shut his eyes. Kali forces an eye open with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand.

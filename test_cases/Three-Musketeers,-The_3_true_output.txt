LOUIS No.  Please, stay. (to Richelieu, aware that she is watching him) Your Eminence, I demand an answer. 
RICHELIEU (hiding his amusement) Perhaps if I knew the question... LOUIS I've just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my Musketeers. RICHELIEU You approved the decision. LOUIS But not the timing of the matter. I intended to address them myself, explain the situation... RICHELIEU Your Majesty, France is on the brink of war. We dare not hesitate. 
LOUIS But these men are my personal guards... RICHELIEU They are the bravest fighters in France. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                33 RICHELIEU (CONT'D) We'll need them in the field if we're to win this war with England. Buckingham plans to invade La Rochelle within the month. I thought it best to act quickly -- 
LOUIS I will be the judge of what is best. For me, and for France. 
He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely, suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than Richelieu imagined. 
RICHELIEU Of course.   Forgive me. A tense beat.    Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward the door. LOUIS Anne?   Are you all right? ANNE You two should continue this discussion in private. LOUIS (hesitates, seeks a reason for her to stay) Your thoughts on the matter interest me. They might... help. 
ANNE It seems to me that... you're doing very well on your own. 
She means it.    Anne smiles, exits.      A beat.   Louis sighs. LOUIS She's beautiful. 
RICHELIEU Extremely. LOUIS Intelligent. 
RICHELIEU Very. 
(CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:    (5)                                               33 LOUIS (after a beat) Sometimes she scares me half to death. RICHELIEU May I advise you? 
Repetition reveals calculation. Louis nods.       And the Cardinal surprises with quiet humor: 
RICHELIEU She scares me too. As do all women who join beauty to intelligence. What's a man to do? 
LOUIS (enjoying the Cardinal's humor) I have no idea. RICHELIEU The course of love is full of frightful turns. But, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid... never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in France. Make that your starting point, and everything else will fall... into place. 
LOUIS The bravest man in France... 
RICHELIEU Good advice for a shopkeeper. Let alone a King. 
A beat. Richelieu acting as the lost father.        And Louis appreciating it, speaking as a son: LOUIS Your Eminence, I'm sorry that I was sharp with you. It's just that the Musketeers... well, they're not just my guards. They're my friends too. 
RICHELIEU I know.   But don't worry. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:    (6)                                               33 RICHELIEU (CONT'D) From now on, I'll take complete responsibility for your welfare. Indeed he will.

34   INT./EXT. THRONE ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY                             34 
Richelieu bursts out of the Throne Room and is joined by Rochefort. Walking quickly down a long hallway. ROCHEFORT He's a foolish boy. And barely that. RICHELIEU That foolish boy is about to become a man. (off Rochefort's look) Which is all the more reason for us to act... quickly. ROCHEFORT (reacts, knows what this portends) And the Queen...? RICHELIEU (he smiles, lewd) She will receive me in ways she never thought possible. Privately. HOLD ON the Cardinal and Rochefort, watching the King and Queen below. CUT TO:

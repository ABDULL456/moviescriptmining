Max and Annie desperately looking for cover. City racing by. Train racing by city. A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle out of harm's way with nowhere to go. As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND SHRIEKS over the track junctures... \nTHE FIRST CAR \nMax and Annie rush in, slide the door shut. This is as far as they can go. They drop into a crouch at the door, breathing hard, terrified, Max with his back against the wall, arm stiffly keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper: \nANNIE Where's the next station? \n", "test3_true": "THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER JUNCTURE...then the LIGHTS RETURN, stuttering. \nMax rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees Max. He shouts, barely audible from here... VINCENT YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!   I DO THIS FOR A LIVING! \n...and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down his face from the missing part of his ear. \n...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit out of the early-morning passengers. \n...and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away... \nAND THE TRAIN GOES DARK. \n(CONTINUED) \n9/30/03 MM revs. (cherry)   110A. 106D   CONTINUED:                                                  106D \nA BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES, both men FIRING THROUGH THE WINDOWS at each other, GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and getting sucked away by the wind, Max screaming, face lit only by the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one- handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME... \n(CONTINUED) \n9/30/03 MM revs. (cherry)    111. 106D   CONTINUED: (2)                                               106D \n...and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN, Max looking        * down, his expression nearly childlike with terror. He stares at the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back - gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, \"go ahead, kill me...\" through the shattered window. \nVincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him. Watching Max. A little smile on his face. \n107    INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT                                   107 \nVincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot Peter Yip the first time. \nOdd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in fact. \nThe magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter quietly. \nVincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back of the car. \nThe .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor. \nMax watches Vincent walk away. \nVincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his breath. \nMax slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars. Slides the second door open. Enters. \nVincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool. \nVincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them. \nVINCENT + MAX \nsit there, riding the train.

He leans his head toward Max as if conferring a secret. In a halting whisper: \nVINCENT Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies. (off Max's look) Think anybody'll notice? \nMAX \nlooks into Vincent's eyes. It means \"I'm that guy\" and \"will anybody notice me when I'm gone?\" \nVINCENT \nleans back, gazing straight ahead now.   Rocking gently with the motion of the train... \n...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same. \nMax has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks. \nMax follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is: \nAN AD \nThe whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.   A dream place. Limitless horizon.                                                    * \n107A   INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN                                107A \nVincent's no longer laughing.   In fact, Vincent's no longer doing anything. Ever. \nAnnie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now. \nThe train pulls in to a station... \nWIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR \n...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light shaft into the station. \nThe doors close again.   The train pulls out. \n(CONTINUED) \n8/24/03 MM revs.   113. 107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A \nWE HOLD ON Vincent for a while.

A few fresh droplets of blood patter quietly. \nVincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back of the car. \nThe .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor. \nMax watches Vincent walk away. \nVincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his breath. \nMax slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars. Slides the second door open. Enters. \nVincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the floor beneath Vincent.

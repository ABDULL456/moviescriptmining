MIRANDA 
What do you think you're doing?    I want to speak to my lawyer -- wait, what are you doing? 
IRENE 
My job. Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth -- 
MIRANDA 
C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm calm now, look -- I'm calm -- ! She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates her. 
INT. REC ROOM - DAY 
DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities. Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead named JENNA: 
CHLOE 
M. 
JENNA 
Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen, Meallaril-S, Meleretten, Meleril, Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine, Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban Modalina -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHLOE 
Modalina?   Isn't that a band? 
JENNA 
Trade name for Triflupoerazine. Look it up. Chloe shrugs, if you say so.       Jenna resumes: 
JENNA 
Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress, Motival. That's it for the 'M's. 
CHLOE 
Not bad. High potency neuroleptics starting with 'J.' 
JENNA 
Trick question. There's only Jatroneural. 
CHLOE 
What do you wanna bet? 
JENNA 
Bet you a soda. Chloe checks a reference book.       Nods, impressed. 
CHLOE 
Right on the money, cowgirl. Twenty points and a soda. CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient, SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit) moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside Miranda. 
SHELLEY 
Hi there, Doc. It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out of it. 
SHELLEY 
I never got shrinked by you but all I hear is nothing gets past you, I mean, that's just hearsay and I don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but I say maybe it just slipped, right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides it over to her. Without malice, like a child. 
SHELLEY 
They put your picture in the paper. It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house. Miranda stares at it in disbelief.      Growing sick. 
MIRANDA 
How did you get this? 
SHELLEY 
Chloe did. Who knows how? Not me. Around here I'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff I don't need to know. My point is about people talking behind other people's backs. Like before I was here, everything I did I thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back. But now I'm more anonymous, more myself. I'm Shelley. Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has no problem holding a conversation all by herself -- 
SHELLEY 
You're not like, undercover here, are you? They pulled that at Spring Grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients, see if they could handle it. Most quit after day one. You're not, are you? 
MIRANDA 
No, Shelley.   I'm not undercover. 
SHELLEY 
Because if you were, I'm like the Fort Knox of secrets. Ask anybody. 
MIRANDA 
That's good to know. But I'm not.

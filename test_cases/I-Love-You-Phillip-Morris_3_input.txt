Amidst the moonlit shadows, the THUMPING of VIGOROUS LOVEMAKING is heard. It continues, getting louder and louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie-style in the bed. 
Building to the climax, Steven moans with pleasure. 
STEVEN I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come... 
Suddenly we see the face of the MOUSTACHED MAN he's fucking. 
MOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
14   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 14 
We are back with Steven in his hospital bed at the Penitentiary. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as I can remember... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
15   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY           15 
WE'RE BACK on the hilltop from the beginning of the movie. 
Nine year old Steven and his three young FRIENDS crest the verdant hill- running and laughing through the backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day. 
They all collapse into the long grass like the splayed arms of a starfish. Catching their breath, they stare up at the sky- searching for shapes in the clouds. 
LITTLE GIRL I see a pony! What do you see!? "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages   5-23-08     13. 
LITTLE BOY I see a diesel train! 
RED HAIRED BOY I see a whirlybird! 
YOUNG STEVEN I see a wiener. 
They look at him with incredulity. 
RED HAIRED BOY What?! What kind of wiener? 
YOUNG STEVEN A man's wiener. 
LITTLE BOY Shut up! There's no wiener! 
YOUNG STEVEN Uh huh! 
RED HAIRED BOY No there's not! 
There is a long silence.   Then- 
LITTLE GIRL Oh I see it. There it is! 
YOUNG STEVEN Told ya... 
And as the other boys squint closely... 
STEVEN (V.O.) Anyway where was I? Oh yeah-- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
16   INT. HOUSTON BEDROOM - 1986 - NIGHT                        16 
Once again, the MOUSTACHED MAN throws his head back in the throes of lust. 
MOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! 
Steven drives it home. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   14. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (matter of fact) And I did. 
17   EXT. HOUSTON APARTMENT DOORWAY, 1986 - LATER THAT NIGHT     17 
The Moustached Man and Steven say goodbye at the door. 
STEVEN (V.O.) I had been living a lie for a long, long time. I tend to do that... hide things. 
MOUSTACHED MAN You be careful out there, you're a little drunk. 
18   EXT. HOUSTON STREET - 1986 - NIGHT                          18 
Steven drives his red Corvette, hard top removed, with a contented look on his face. He glows as the Pet Shop Boys' "West End Girls" plays on the radio. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Now just because I was screwing around doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart... Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way. (beat) That's what I told myself. But life has a way of forcing these things into the light. 
CRASH! A CROSSING PICKUP TRUCK smashes into the driver side door-- violently propelling steven and his corvette out of frame. 
STEVEN (V.O.) You might even call it an epiphany.

1ST JOURNALIST What's the problem then? 
MATHIEU Political support. Sometimes it's there, sometimes not ... sometimes, it's not enough. What were they saying in Paris yesterday? 
5TH JOURNALIST Nothing ... Sartre has written another article ... 
Mathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say: "see what I mean?" At the same time, he opens the door. But before entering, he turns again to the journalists. 
MATHIEU Will you kindly explain to me why all the Sartres are always born on the other side? 
5TH JOURNALIST Then you like Sartre, colonel ... 
MATHIEU Not really, but he's even less appealing as an enemy. 
100	PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT AND RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. SUNSET. 
Place du Gouvernement, dusk, the other side of the blockade is silent, only the uncovered eyes of the Algerian women who await their men. 
The trucks continue to arrive: the men are forced to descend and allowed to enter the Casbah. There is an atmosphere of sadness, for not all the men have returned. The women look at them, scrutinize their faces, from the first to the last in one glance, then slowly ... one face at a time. Some women recognize their husbands, or their brothers or their sons, and run to meet them ... 
But others continue to ask for news in lowered, sorrowful voices. 
AD-LIB VOICES Have you seen Mohamed? Where? When? Why hasn't he returned? 
A steady hum of voices in Arabic; then the monotonous voice of a policeman who speaks in the microphone of the loudspeaker. 
LOUDSPEAKER "The NLF wants to stop you from working. The NLF forces you to close your shops, inhabitants of the Casbah, disobey their orders. France has given you civilization and prosperity: schools, streets, hospitals. People of the Casbah! Show your love for your mother country by disobeying the terrorists' orders." 
The loudspeaker is attached to one of the blockade posts, and from it a long wire for the microphone is hanging. The policeman has a raspy and bored voice; he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in front of him. He gets up, lights a cigarette, and moves away a few steps. 
Two children are among the women and behind the wooden horses barricades. They were waiting for this moment. 
They bend, seem to be playing, but one of them lifts the barbed wire as high as he can, from the ground. Petit Omar passes a wire underneath, its farthest end bent in the form of a hook. He moves it toward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground. He succeeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly. The cord unwinds, lengthens, stretches, until the microphone on the table begins to move, until it reaches the edge of the table, and falls ... 
The noise re-echoes in the loudspeaker, but no one pays any attention to it. 
Petit Omar waits a second, then begins to pull again. 
The microphone is dragged along the ground -- a humming sound -- it moves nearer, inch by inch, forward, under the barbed wire, until the children are able to take it, and disappear with it behind the women. 
LOUDSPEAKER "Algerians! Brothers! Do not be afraid! Algeria will be free. Be courageous, brothers! Resist! Do not listen to what they are telling you ... Algeria will be free ..." 
The voice is not violent, but gentle, somewhat breathless and hurried. It extends to the whole square, so that all can hear it well: the people stop what they are doing to listen. They are emotional, proud, or angry, and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused, as if those words should be written up above. 
The officer is slow to realize what has happened, looks at the loudspeaker, the cord, and now grabs it, cursing. He pulls and tugs it; the wire yields, and he wrenches it from the microphone. 
LOUDSPEAKER "Brothers--" 
The voice is no longer heard, nothing more, silence. 
Silence, only that something is changed in the women's eyes. The veils that cover the lower half of their faces suddenly begin to tremble, sway as if shaken by a breath, a light wind. There is no longer an atmosphere of sadness, or silence. 
JU-JU. 
The ju-jus attack the air, invade it, shake it, make it vibrate as if they were electric charges, or the sound produced by the wind on a field of dry reeds, or the sound produced by a hundred, a thousand fingernails that are scratching a window pane ... 
101	HEADQUARTERS. PARA. OUTSIDE. DAY. 
PARA One, two, three, four ... Inside! C'mon! 
The five Algerians indicated are forced to get up, taken, pushed, and brought inside a large deserted house which is the paras' headquarters. 
The other Algerians, about a hundred of them, are sitting on the ground, in the clearing in front of the house, and the paras of the first regiment continue to guard them with pointed machine guns ... 
Suddenly from the villa, the music of a French song comes forth at full blast. 
The Algerians look at each other nervously. Even a young para seems to be upset. 
1ST PARA (turning to other para) What are they doing? 
2ND PARA (smiling) Dancing inside ... 
102	HEADQUARTERS. VILLA. INSIDE. DAY. 
A para rushes through a corridor carrying a tape recorder, enters a room where there are some sergeants and an Algerian. 
The adjoining room with white tiled walls and a sink is visible through an open door. Two paras are sitting on the floor, smoking and chatting between themselves in whispers. 
The para places the tape recorder on the table. The Algerian is naked to the waist. Signs of torture are visible. His face is swollen and wet. The sergeant places the chair near him, and helps him to sit down, then starts the tape recorder. He says to the Algerian who is trembling: 
SERGEANT Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...

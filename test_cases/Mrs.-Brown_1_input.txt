A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling his horse.  Suddenly he turns. 
VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage. 
VICTORIA Mr Brown. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so. 
BROWN Yes, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Then why do you persist in doing it? 
BROWN Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her. 
A beat. 
VICTORIA The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. 
BROWN And I intend to be there when she's ready. 
Silence.  The two of them stare at each other. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY 
The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the distance, the glittering sea. 
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY 
VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in silence. 
EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY 
VICTORIA looks up. 
VICTORIA Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. 
BROWN It's a fine spot, ma'am. 
VICTORIA He thought so, yes. 
She stares ahead. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) In everything I do and everything I say, I try to think, as much as possible, what he would do, or say, if he were here now.  My Private Secretary wishes me to return to public duties-- 
She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in. 
BROWN If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. 
VICTORIA Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it. (beat) The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- 
She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not? 
BROWN Aye, ma'am. 
VICTORIA Yes. 
A pause.

114 EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY 114 
James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts off again.. but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs back in the opposite direction... Uh oh.. 
SMASH TO: 
115 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 115 
ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes pop open. She's lying atop a bed, fully clothed. She rises, reorienting. 
116 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 116 
The blinds are pulled. Alice and Jasper stare blankly at a 
T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone. BELLA I wish he'd call. 
ALICE You should eat. 
But Bella ignores the food. She sits heavily. 
BELLA They could get hurt. It's not worth it. 
JASPER (insistent) Yes. It is. 
She's taken aback. It's the first time he's engaged with her. 
JASPER Edward's changed since he found you. And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you. 
(he looks forward again) It's worth it. 
Suddenly, Alice REELS. Jasper goes to her, Bella follows. 
JASPER What do you see? 
ALICE (with deep worry) The tracker. He just changed course.. 
Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her. 
JASPER Where will it take him, Alice? 
PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we- 
FLASH POP TO - JAMES 
A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of.. 
ALICE Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors. 
Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying to see it clearly. 
BELLA How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain. 
JASPER She sees the course people are on, while they're on it. If they change their minds, the visions change. 
Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing. 
BELLA So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio? 
ALICE (looks up at her) You've been here? 
BELLA No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that. 
JASPER Was your school here in Phoenix? 
BELLA Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years. 
JASPER Do you have any reason to go now? 
BELLA No. Hell, no. I hated the place. 
Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS. She picks it up. Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief. She answers.. 
BELLA Edward. Are you alright? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
117 INT. JEEP/EXT. WASHINGTON ROAD - DAY 117 
Dr. Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in the passenger seat on his cell phone. 
EDWARD I'm coming to get you. (hates having to say 
this) We lost the tracker. The woman is still in the area. Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father. 
BELLA 
(sinking) This is my fault. You warned me, but I didn't think. I just.. 
EDWARD Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel..

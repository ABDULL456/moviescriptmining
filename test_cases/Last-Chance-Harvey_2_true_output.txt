Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it another `old school' burst. 
He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening them. 
Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the piano. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT 
Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully. He's good. 
He finally brings the piece to an end. 
KATE Wow. 
Harvey blushes. 
KATE (CONT'D) One of yours? 
Harvey smiles at Kate. 
HARVEY You are very kind. But...no. (beat) Shearing doing Rogers. 
KATE Ah. (beat) Well...you play it very well. 
HARVEY (bows his head a little/with a smile) Well, thank you Ms. Walker. 
KATE You're most welcome, Mr Shine. 
They share a little smile. Beat. 
HARVEY Me thinks you were leaving? 
KATE Indeed I was, Sire. 
HARVEY Why? 
Beat. 
KATE Because you looked happy. 
Harvey looks quizzically at Kate. Beat. 
KATE (CONT'D) You should be with your family, Harvey. 
HARVEY But, you know, maybe I want to be with you. (beat/sings) You make me happy - when skies are grey. 
Kate smiles. 
KATE Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing. 
Beat. 
HARVEY Thank you. 
KATE For what? 
HARVEY For making me come here. 
Beat. 
KATE You're welcome. 
They share a look, before both looking away. Beat. 
HARVEY Can I? 
KATE What?

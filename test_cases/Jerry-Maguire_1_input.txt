DOROTHY Take care you guys. 
Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air. 
DOROTHY (continuing) Look...  I was up for a job in San Diego before I left SMI. It's with the Chargers. 
AIRPLANE WHEELS 
touching down. 
JERRY Don't even talk about that yet. I'll find something fast for Tidwell. We'll stay afloat. 
EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY 
Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend, director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is arguing with Tidwell. 
Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a camel. 
DOOLER Look, Rod, just get on the camel! 
JERRY Bill, Rod, wait -- 
TIDWELL Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME. 
JERRY Rod, get on the camel. 
DOOLER (shoots look to Jerry) The sponsor wants a camel -- 
TIDWELL Jerry, back me up.  It's either the camel or me... 
Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions. 
JERRY (takes the bullet) Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway. 
DOOLER Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him. 
EXT. SET -- LATER 
Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the background, another athlete rides the camel. 
TIDWELL There you go, dude.  You're learning how to represent me.  We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad -- 
Jerry rubs his face. 
JERRY Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? 
TIDWELL Oh, we gonna be friends now? 
JERRY What do you know about dating a single mother? 
Tidwell warms to the personal question. 
TIDWELL Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother. 
JERRY Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. 
Tidwell is always happy to hold forth. 
TIDWELL First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? 
JERRY How do I know? 
TIDWELL You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know? 
JERRY No, I don't know. 
TIDWELL Then you gotta have The Talk. 
JERRY But I sure don't like that she's leaving. 
TIDWELL Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. 
JERRY The kid is amazing. 
TIDWELL (shaking head) No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom. 
JERRY I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- (a look) Alright, I shoplifted the pooty. 
TIDWELL Shame on you.  SHAME on you. 
INT. ZOO -- DAY 
Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's arm. Life-changing decisions in the air. 
DOROTHY They offered me everything I asked for, it's only 2 hours away. I think it's good for us. 
Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray. They approach the reptile house. 
RAY Show me the animal, Jerry!

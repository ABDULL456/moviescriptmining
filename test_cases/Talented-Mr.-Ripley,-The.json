{"train": "\"The Talented Mr Ripley\", shooting draft, by Anthony Minghella \nTHE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY \nScreenplay By ANTHONY MINGHELLA \nBased On The Novel By PATRICIA  HIGHSMITH \n1st November 1999 \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"SCENE OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nPROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING. \nFade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film, sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness. \nRIPLEY (O/S) If I could just go back.  If I could rub everything out.  Starting with myself. Starting with borrowing a jacket. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING. \nRipley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano. CREDITS begin. \nFRAN (SINGS) Ah, such fleeting paradise such innocent delight to love, be loved, a lullabye, then silence. \nThe song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary. Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair, approaches Ripley, offers his hand. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf. \nRIPLEY Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF (pointing at Ripley's borrowed jacket) I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf... \nEMILY GREENLEAF We couldn't help noticing your jacket. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Yes. \nEMILY GREENLEAF Class of '56? \nRIPLEY (hesitating) How is Dickie? \nINT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING. \nFran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley. \nEMILY GREENLEAF (to Fran) I hope you'll come and see us... \nFRAN That's very kind. \nEMILY GREENLEAF Both of you... \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Of course, Dickie's idea of music is Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz is just noise, just an insolent noise. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING. \nRipley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him his share of their fee. \nRIPLEY Gotta run. I'm so late. (he hands Fran's boyfriend the jacket he's been wearing) Thanks for the jacket. \nBOYFRIEND Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me. \nFrom Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing. \nEMILY GREENLEAF Darling couple, aren't they? \nRipley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment before closing the door behind him. \nEXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY. \nRipley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight. He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's chauffeur. \nCHAUFFEUR Here.  I'll take that. \nRIPLEY Thanks. \nCARETAKER (nodding towards the apartment) That thousand bucks should come in handy. \nRIPLEY Yes, sir. \nCHAUFFEUR (interupts Ripley, who is about to open the car door) I'll get that. \nRIPLEY Thanks. \nCHAUFFEUR (as he holds open the door for Ripley) Sir. (Ripley laughs excitedly) You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr Greenleaf is personal friends with the Cunard people. \nINT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY. \nRipley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery. Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks and dollars. \nCHAUFFEUR I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors. \nEXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY. \nThe liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS. \nINT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY. \nITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked. Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows. Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted, escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him. \nRipley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his. \nMEREDITH What's your secret? \nRIPLEY Excuse me? \nMEREDITH No, it's just - you are American, aren't you? - no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating. \nRipley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall. \nRIPLEY Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello. \nMEREDITH Hello. \nThey are passed through immigration, head down the long stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? \nRIPLEY (thinking quickly) Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship. \nMEREDITH So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just - upstairs - weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there. \nRIPLEY My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel under my mother's name. \nMEREDITH Which is? \nRIPLEY Emily. (Meredith's bewildered) Just kidding. \nDICKIE Who's this? \nRIPLEY It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. \nDICKIE Okay. (he sits up) And did we know each other? \nRIPLEY Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me. \nDICKIE (to Marge) Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. (to Ripley) This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what was it? \nRIPLEY Ripley. Hullo. How do you do. \nMARGE How do you do. \nDICKIE What are you doing in Mongi? \nRIPLEY Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through. \nDICKIE (finds this idea absurd) Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray, actually. \nRIPLEY It's just an undercoat. (Marge laughs) \nDICKIE Say again? \nRIPLEY You know, a primer. \nDICKIE That's funny. \nHe shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up. \nMARGE You should come and have lunch with us, before you go - Dickie? \nDICKIE Sure.  Any time. \nMARGE And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink. \nRIPLEY Thanks. Well, a coincidence. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING. \nANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps. RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty, SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then climbs on the scooter, behind him. \nDICKIE I've been looking for you everywhere. \nSILVANA Ah, today you're looking for me.  And where have you been the rest of the week? Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate you, you know? \nDICKIE What? \nSILVANA I hate you. \nAnd RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards the sea. \nEXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON. \nDickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head. Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late. \nDICKIE Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine. \nMARGE Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. \nDICKIE I just woke up.  I'm sorry. \nMARGE You just woke up! \nRIPLEY Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back? \nDICKIE What? \nRIPLEY I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you \nINT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK. \nA christening is over and now the whole village is pouring out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug. Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's scheming. \nDICKIE I'm never going back. To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane, hasn't he? \nSILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other. Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on. \nDICKIE (cont'd) I'm never going back! \nRIPLEY No, I think your mother, her illness - \nDICKIE It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for - ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! - it's got nothing to do with my mother. \nRIPLEY I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I - \nDICKIE (interrupting) Go back!  Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard. \nEXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON. \nRipley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom talking with Dickie. \nMARGE Hi Tom. \nDICKIE (looks up) Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. \nMARGE I'll come down. \nDICKIE (to Ripley) Did you speak to my father? \nRIPLEY You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. \nMARGE (coming out of the front door) Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? \nRIPLEY Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. \nHe goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps. \nRIPLEY (cont'd) Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's - \nDickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles. \nDICKIE You like jazz! \nRIPLEY (gathering up the records) I love jazz. \nDICKIE (holding up a Chet Baker) This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz. \nMARGE I never said that! \nRIPLEY Bird. That's jazz. \nDICKIE Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat - \nRIPLEY I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? \nDICKIE Bird! \nDICKIE Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom. \nAbove them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody, until he's as accurate as a taperecorder. \nEXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY. \nErmelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his pants, his rings. \nDICKIE Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.  It's not love it's the coffee machine. \nMARGE It's the one task Dickie can do on his own - make coffee. \nDICKIE Shut up. \nMARGE Oh darling - is that for me? \nDICKIE No it's for Tom as he didn't complain. \nRIPLEY (as Dickie hands him his cup) That ring's so great. The green one. \nMARGE (delighted) Tom, I love you! (to Dickie) See! (to Ripley) I bought it for him, for his birthday. \nRIPLEY It's superb. \nDICKIE I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off - otherwise I'd give it to you. \nMARGE (flicking a crumb at him) Bastard! (to Ripley) Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks. \nDICKIE I hope it wasn't cheap. \nMARGE Oh, it was. \nRIPLEY (to Marge) I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? \nMARGE Frances? \nRIPLEY My fianc\u00c8e. \nDICKIE You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged? \nRIPLEY Your parents met her. \nDICKIE Oh God - I can just imagine - if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never going back. \nEXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY. \nThe Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him. \nRIPLEY I'm doing this wrong, aren't I? \nDICKIE You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well. \nMARGE Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open. \nDICKIE Yes please! \nShe heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley. \nRIPLEY Could we sail to Venice? \nDICKIE Sure.  I love Venice. \nRIPLEY I have to go to Venice. \nDICKIE I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. (considering Ripley) What were you actually doing in New York? \nRIPLEY I played piano in a few places. \nDICKIE That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. \nRIPLEY A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York. \nDICKIE The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. (drinking) Cold beer. Thank you Dad. \nRIPLEY Copy out from here... \nHe hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines. \nDICKIE (staring to write on the back of a postcard) I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true? \nRIPLEY No! I've got more than one shirt! \nDICKIE She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. (he's finished writing) \nRIPLEY Now your signature. (watching him write) Not \"Dickie\". Your signature. \nDickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard. Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean them. Dickie looks at him. \nDICKIE Without the glasses you're not even ugly. (takes them, tries them on) I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. \nRIPLEY Like Clark Kent. (takes them back, puts them on beaming at Dickie) Now Superman. \nDickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard. \nDICKIE I know. I write like a child. \nRIPLEY Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's pain, that's secret pain. \nDICKIE It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it. \nRIPLEY Your handwriting - nothing more naked. See - nothing's quite touching the line - that's vanity. \nDICKIE (flattered) Well we certainly know that's true. \nINT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. \nDickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine. \nDICKIE Do you have any brothers? \nRIPLEY No, no brothers, no sisters. \nDICKIE me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children - what does that mean? \nHe looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long. \nRIPLEY Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? \nDICKIE No! \nRIPLEY I didn't mean with you in it. \nDICKIE (standing) Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway. \nHe gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with his towel. \nINT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY. \nMarge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie makes a face at Freddie. \nDICKIE Do you think you can steer this thing? \nFREDDIE Sure. \nDICKIE Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks. \nFREDDIE What are you doing? \nDICKIE Marge-maintenance. \nFREDDIE Aye, aye. \nDickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water. \nFrom where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves, he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely betrayed. \nFREDDIE (cont'd) Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy, you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy. \nShamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his. \nEXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY. \nThe Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring. Dickie notices her too. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY. \nA WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water. \nIt's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden, staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette, wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their shoulders. \nThe whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves, the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is walking on water. \nSuddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water, about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA. One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse. It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief - wades, swims, splashes towards the body. \nPANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace, Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye. \nEXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY. \nMarge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters, police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls away. \nRIPLEY What's the fight about? That's her fianc\u00c8, isn't it?  Are they blaming him? \nDICKIE (sharp) I don't know! Why are you asking me? (agitated) How can it take an hour to find an ambulance? \nMARGE (conciliatory) Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose - \nDICKIE I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive. \nAnd with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across the terrace. Dickie storms inside. \nMARGE Dickie! \nRIPLEY I'll go and see what's the matter. \nMARGE I'll go. \nINT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON. \nLater, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears, begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top. \nRIPLEY I know why you're upset. (Dickie continues playing) I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you and Silvana. \nRIPLEY I've got plans! \nDICKIE Ripley's plans. \nRIPLEY Esatto. I'm always planning. \nDICKIE Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I? \nRIPLEY Why are you asking all of a sudden? \nDICKIE No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? \nRIPLEY Why? \nDICKIE I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. \nRIPLEY Then I'll take it as a compliment. \nDICKIE I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! \nRIPLEY (a beat) Ha. \nDICKIE Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit? \nRIPLEY (conceding, without guile) I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York... \nDickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love. \nDICKIE I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums? \nRIPLEY What? \nDICKIE So cool. \nHe mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this - it's superficiality. \nEXT. MID OCEAN. DAY. \nThe bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor boat. \nDICKIE That's how I found my place in Mongi. Took a boat out round the bay.  The first place I liked, I got it. \nThe motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by the speed. \nRIPLEY Dickie, slow down, come on! \nRipley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore. \nDICKIE (ecstatic) I love it here! Gonna live here! \nDickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich. \nRIPLEY I wanted to tell you my plan. \nDICKIE So tell me. \nRIPLEY I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. \nDICKIE (suddenly tight) Really?  To Italy? \nRIPLEY Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - I'll get a job - or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here - \nDICKIE Oh God, I don't think so. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING. \nRipley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not wearing his glasses. \nRIPLEY Can I have my key, please? \nRECEPTIONIST (at the key rack) Of course - But you must be very cold? Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? - \nRIPLEY (mind racing) No, it's - I'm... \nEXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY. \nRipley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea what to do. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY. \nThe BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very together. \nINT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY. \nRipley walks into the living room, slowly approaches Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much. \nINT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. \nRipley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter. \nEXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY. \nRipley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps. \nRIPLEY Hello Marge. \nMARGE Tom, you startled me!  You're back. \nRIPLEY How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? \nMARGE Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks. \nRIPLEY I was just looking at you - (looking at her tenderly) - so quiet. \nMARGE Where's Dickie? \nRIPLEY I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days. \nMARGE (looks at him) Ha. Did he say why? \nRIPLEY I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine. \nMARGE What does that mean? \nRIPLEY Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me. \nMARGE Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone? \nRIPLEY He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked me to deliver this. \nHe hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume. \nMARGE Thanks. he knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited... \nRIPLEY Errand number one - deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. \nMARGE (alarmed) How long's he staying for? \nMEREDITH (entering the shop) Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao. \nEXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY. \nRipley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe. \nMEREDITH But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you? \nRIPLEY What? \nMEREDITH At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and - \nRIPLEY (interrupting, astonished) How did you know that? \nMEREDITH Everybody knows Freddie Miles. \nRIPLEY (unsettled) Is Freddie in Rome? \nMEREDITH Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R. \nRIPLEY I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome. \nMEREDITH Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if - \nRIPLEY Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life. \nEXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY. \nMeredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head inside the office. \nMEREDITH The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do - agreed? - you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it. \nRIPLEY I know. \nMEREDITH I've never admitted that to anyone. \nINT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY. \nRipley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him. \nShe takes her money, turns to him. \nHe hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber. \nRIPLEY I don't want too many large bills. Nobody will change them. \nINT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY. \nWhere A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against Ripley. \nMEREDITH Show me the other one again. (the Tailor obliges) I like them both. \nRIPLEY I'll take them both. \nRipley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside, Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices the open sax case, peers inside. \nMEREDITH (O/S) I know you're a jazz fiend but do you absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been trying to give my tickets away, it's tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be dragged... \nShe looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by him, the romance she feels to be in the air. \nRIPLEY (emerging) You could drag me. \nINT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME. \nMARGE I don't know her. (to Ripley) He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people. \nThe last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return. \nPETER Will we see you later? \nRIPLEY I can't later. \nPETER And tomorrow? \nRIPLEY Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? \nPETER I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? \nRIPLEY Ten thirty? \nPETER We'll be there. \nRIPLEY Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. (to Peter) It's really good to meet you. \nINT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT. \nRipley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her. \nRIPLEY Let's go. \nMEREDITH I thought you were enjoying yourself? \nRIPLEY Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. \nMEREDITH You're crazy! It's freezing out there. \nHe's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting dangerously near as they approach their seats. \nRIPLEY C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. \nMEREDITH (quite taken) Okay then, you're crazy. \nEXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT. \nMeredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber. Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge. \nMEREDITH Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. \nRIPLEY You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now - I look at you and I see her face - and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you - I just can't... \nMEREDITH No, I absolutely understand. Of course. \nRIPLEY Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. \nMEREDITH Beating you away. \nEXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME. \nThey arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go inside, then looks at him. \nMEREDITH Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too...you should always save pain for daylight... \nRIPLEY Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. \nMEREDITH (fluttering) I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps? \nRIPLEY Exactly. 10.30 - (instantly correcting himself) \nMARGE I hope so. \nPETER (to Marge) That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said - (to Ripley) Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie - \nRIPLEY My God. \nPETER But the point is Dickie - well we know this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... \nRIPLEY It's fantastic. (to Peter) I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty. \nINT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY. \nRipley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley explores, relishing the decor. \nSIGNORA BUFFI Accendo il riscaldamento. (I'll turn the heating on.) \nRIPLEY (mimes playing sax) Mi piace suonare. (I like to play music.) \nSIGNORA BUFFI (shrugs) Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace? (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So, do you like it?) \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON. \nRipley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas. There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a glass, pours himself a drink. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON. \nRipley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous. \nRIPLEY Hello? \nFREDDIE (O/S) Dickie? \nRIPLEY Who is it? \nFREDDIE (O/S) It's Freddie. Let me in. \nRIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint. \nFREDDIE (O/S) Dickie, come on, it's me. \nRipley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the door. \nRIPLEY Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley. \nFREDDIE (confused, not pleasantly) Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you? \nRIPLEY Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it? \nFREDDIE I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. \nRIPLEY I guess. \nFREDDIE The landlady - as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now. \nRIPLEY He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you. \nFREDDIE Because he's been hiding from me - what happened at Christmas? \nRIPLEY What about Christmas? \nFREDDIE He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart. \nRipley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers. \nROVERINI Dickie Greenleaf? \nRIPLEY Yes? \nROVERINI Inspector Roverini. Can we come in? \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING. \nRipley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently. \nROVERINI It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? \nRIPLEY I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. \nROVERINI So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? \nRIPLEY I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? \nRoverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian. \nROVERINI Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in Rome. \nRIPLEY Yes, if it's going to help, certainly. \nROVERINI So, the Doctor, he has to make the - (looks at Baggio) - come se dice? \nRIPLEY Postmortem? \nROVERINI Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening. \nRIPLEY Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car. \nROVERINI No. \nEXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING. \nRipley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an Italian, runs up concerned. \nEXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY. \nRipley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter. Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no mood for pleasantries. \nMARGE Did he kill Freddie? \nRIPLEY Marge, when did you get here? \nMARGE Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? \nRIPLEY I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. \nMARGE I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. \n(focusing on Ripley's cuts and bruises) What happened to your face? \nRIPLEY Dickie did it. \nMARGE (suddenly tense) Dickie? \nRIPLEY My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have.  About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us.  And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. (he pulls the scooter off the stand) Are you getting on? \nMARGE What? \nRIPLEY Get on. I'll take you to him. \nPETER That's good, isn't it? \nRIPLEY (as if suffocating) No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the - \nPETER You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered - \nRIPLEY It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe. \nA door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple. Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN introduces him. \nPOLICEMAN Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di Roma. \nVERRECCHIA (to Peter, in Italian) Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley? \nPETER (in Italian) Lui. Him. \nVerrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous. \nINT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY. \nThis room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through. \nVerrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian, during which Peter translates. \nVERRECCHIA Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles. \nPETER (translating) He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie...disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder. \nVERRECCHIA Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? (When was the last time Ripley saw Greenleaf?) \nRipley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and answers. \nRIPLEY In Rome, about three weeks ago. (shrugs) I knew that one. \nPETER (giving Ripley a look) A Roma, circa tre settimane fa. \nVERRECCHIA Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora? \nPETER (translating) Where have you been since then? \nRIPLEY I've been backpacking. \nPETER I don't know how to translate that. (he tries) E difficile....il signor Ripley ....dormiva all'aperto, con un... \nVERRECCHIA All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto? \nPETER He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside. \nVERRECCHIA Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali? \nPETER Are you a homosexual? (then as himself) Interesting non-sequitur. \nRIPLEY No. \nPETER (translates for him) No. (as Peter, drily) By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient. \nRIPLEY Tell him I have a fianc\u00c8e, Dickie has a fianc\u00c8e and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them. \nPETER (translating) Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate. \nVERRECCHIA (laughs) Mamma mia, quante fidanzate! \nThey all laugh. \nA YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER. A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the organ. \nRipley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back. \nEXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY. \nMARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley and Peter have come to meet her. \nMARGE (kissing him warmly) Hello Peter, so good to see you. \nRIPLEY Hello Marge! \nMARGE (coolly) Tom. \nThey walk towards the Vaporetto. \nMARGE (cont'd) So you found Peter... \nPETER I think we sort of found each other. \nMarge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers. \nPETER (cont'd) Where's Dickie's father? \nMARGE He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach - I don't think the food here is agreeing with him. \nRIPLEY I was looking forward to seeing him. \nMARGE Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's father's employing him. \nRIPLEY That's a terrific idea. \nMARGE He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared. \nThey step onto the Vaporetto. \nMARGE (cont'd) Is that what you do before you jump in the Tiber?  I don't think so. \nEXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY. \nThe boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags. \nMARGE (to Peter) Is this you? \nPETER No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh? \nMARGE Golly. Who's paying for this? \nRIPLEY Peter found it for me. I can afford it because it's damp and, and falling down. \nINT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY. \nMarge, entering the living room, is astonished at its grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar. \nMARGE This is spectacular. \nPETER That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels. \nMARGE A hotel would've been fine. (to Ripley) We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched. \nRipley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow raging. Peter turns \nPETER What's funny? \nRIPLEY I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF (such a disappointed father) Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the word? (Ripley shakes his head) The moment someone confronts him he lashes out.  He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children. \nINT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK. \nRipley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter and Marge. \nRIPLEY I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep. \nPETER You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay? \nMARGE Did Dickie's Dad go? \nRIPLEY He's having an early night. \nMARGE Poor man. (she heads to her room) We were knocking on that door for ever. (she fiddles inside the sleeve of her dress) I think I've broken my strap. \nPETER Not guilty. \nRIPLEY I'll fix some drinks. \nMARGE You walk in Venice! \nShe takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear, then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley, a little concerned. \nPETER Are you okay? \nRIPLEY I'm fine. \nPETER (a hand on his shoulder) Do you want me to stick around? \nRIPLEY It's okay. \nPETER Or I could come back. \nRipley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles. \nPETER (cont'd) Your key. \nINT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT. \nRipley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door. \nMARGE (O/S) Tom? \nRIPLEY Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long. \nMARGE (O/S) Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent. \nRipley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's slightly breathless. \nMARGE I found Dickie's rings. \nRIPLEY What? \nMARGE You've got Dickie's rings. \nRIPLEY I can explain. \nHe can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence. \nMARGE Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring. \nPETER Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans for the future? \nRIPLEY I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me. \nPETER You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though.  Come back. (smiles at him) You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. \nRIPLEY Well, that's entirely your fault.  And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too. \nEXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET. \nRipley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset. Then a voice shakes him from his reverie. \nMEREDITH Dickie?  Dickie? \nHe turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) Dickie, my God! \nRIPLEY Hello Meredith. \nMEREDITH I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you... \nRIPLEY Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward. \nMEREDITH What? \nRIPLEY Just kidding. Are you alone? \nMEREDITH Hardly. I couldn't be less alone. \nMeredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER COUPLES are walking around the deck. \nRIPLEY Of course.  Aunt Joan. \nMEREDITH And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. \nRIPLEY I've thought about you. \nAnd now he's thinking I can't kill them all... \nMEREDITH When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? \nRIPLEY I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer. \nMEREDITH You're kidding. \nRIPLEY They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me. \nMEREDITH You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible. \nRIPLEY I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later? \nHe kisses her.  Full of future. \nMEREDITH So - are you travelling under R? \nRIPLEY You know what - I am. \nMEREDITH Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him. \nRIPLEY (horrified) Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months.  No, I'm alone. (and he understands this is not any kind of lie) \nINT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT. \n", "test1_input": "DICKIE I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with Mongi. \nFreddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the street to Freddie's car. \nFREDDIE I know.  I was there. (looks back to see Ripley struggling to settle the check) Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater. Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy! \nRipley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He has to crouch in the rear. \nFREDDIE (cont'd) You're going to have to sit between us. But don't put your shoes on the seat, know what I mean, put them one on top of the other.  Okay? \nINT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON. \nThis record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant, while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly. He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading. Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the accordion doors. \nDICKIE Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is - if you want to be a tourist - grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station. \nRIPLEY (absolutely crestfallen) What club? \nDICKIE Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...? \nRIPLEY I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you... \nFREDDIE (from inside the booth) Dick - you've got to hear this! \nDICKIE (oblivious to Ripley's pain) Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it.  I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life. \nRipley hands him the coats, turns away. \nDICKIE Ciao.  Have fun. \nRipley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the booth.  Dickie pushes it open. \nRIPLEY You said to make sure you didn't miss the train. It leaves at eight. \nEXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON. \nRipley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't alone. \nINT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT. \nIt's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone. \nINT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nThere's music playing, Bing Crosby's \"May I\". Very loud. Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair, catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up session. He sings along with Bing. \nDICKIE (O/S) What are you doing? \nRipley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the doorway.  The music thumps away. \nRIPLEY Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie. (pause) I didn't think you were coming back. \nDickie turns off the record player. \nDICKIE I wish you'd get out of my clothes. \nRipley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes his head. \nDICKIE (cont'd) Shoes too? \nRIPLEY (lame, ashamed) You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry. \nDICKIE Get undressed in your own room, would you? \n", "test1_true": "DICKIE Freddie drove me back in his car. \nRIPLEY (horrified) Is Freddie here? \nDICKIE He's downstairs. \nRIPLEY I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry. \nDickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the dressing-up session, not amused. \nEXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY. \nRipley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks perfectly happy. \nMARGE Hi, Tom.  Come join us. \nFREDDIE I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear his clothes, and his father picks up the tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll do it! \nEXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY. \nThe boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley is sitting alone, reading. \nMARGE You really should go in, it's marvellous. \nRIPLEY I'm fine. \nShe approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak. \nMARGE Are you okay? \nRIPLEY Sure. \nThey watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water. \nMARGE The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold. \nRIPLEY So I'm learning. \nMARGE He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times... \nThere's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him. \nDICKIE (laughing and choking) He's drowning me! \nMARGE It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful - did you meet him, he's a musician? - ... and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys. \nThey watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface. \nMARGE (cont'd) Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way. \nRIPLEY What about Cortina? \nMARGE Didn't Dick say? - he talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out - (Ripley's devastated, Marge notices, can't look at him) Freddie says there aren't enough rooms. \nEXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK. \nLATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller. \nDICKIE Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back?  At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna. \nFREDDIE I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club.  Have some drinks, lotta ladies... \n", "test1_id": 3048, "test2_input": "ROVERINI November 7th is my information. \nRIPLEY I don't remember the exact date. \nROVERINI And when did you last see Signor Ripley? \nRIPLEY A few days ago. \nROVERINI Does he stay with you here? \nRIPLEY No! \nROVERINI No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. \nRIPLEY It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. \nROVERINI 31 people. \nRIPLEY 31 people. \nBaggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky. \nROVERINI That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood. \nRIPLEY (appalled, defeated) Let her in, what's the difference?  Let her in. (Baggio is on his way to the door.) No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later. \nRoverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out. \nRIPLEY (cont'd) Thank you. \nROVERINI (watching him) May I ask...why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc\u00c8e? \nRIPLEY I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. \nROVERINI Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? \nRIPLEY I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. \nROVERINI Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. \nRIPLEY It is a little coarse, yes. \nROVERINI Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley since San - \nRIPLEY I have! \nROVERINI You have, yes. \nRIPLEY No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! and if I could remember which hotel he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom was staying at the Goldoni. \nROVERINI Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A coincidence. (he gets up to leave) I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. \nRIPLEY Absolutely. \nROVERINI (suddenly turning) I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a - confronto - line-up. (ominously) Tomorrow then? \nRIPLEY (thrown, scrabbling) Tomorrow. \nRipley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the stairs. \nROVERINI (O/S) Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I really don't think he wants to see anyone. \nRipley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then suddenly a voice shocks him upright. \n", "test2_true": "Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT. \nRipley's at the typewriter, he begins to type. \nRIPLEY (O/S) My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this. Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought about going to the police, but I can't do it, I can't face it.  I can't face anything anymore... \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT. \nCHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes, dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek. \nHe takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face. \nRIPLEY (O/S) ...I wish I could give you the life I took for granted. You've always understood what's at the heart of me, Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's why I'm writing this to you, the brother I never had. The only true friend I ever had. In all kinds of ways you're much more like the son my father always wanted. I realise you can change the people, change the scenery, but you can't change your own rotten self. Now I can't think what to do, or where to go. I'm haunted by everything I've done, and can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on. I've made a mess of being Dickie Greenleaf haven't I? \nHe's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating, as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf. \nINT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT. \nRipley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's saxophone. \nOutside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated fitfully by the strobe of cold blue. \nEXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT. \nRipley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off into the darkness. \nEXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT. \nRipley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley, hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it. \nEXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN. \nRipley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith- Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back. \nPETER (indicating the taxi stop) I'll see you over there! \nEXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING. \nRipley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful grey. \nRIPLEY Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten. \nPETER Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece? \nRIPLEY What rumour? \nPETER That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous. \nINT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY. \nLater.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station, where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley waits. \nPETER Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day. \nRIPLEY It's okay. \nPETER Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally.  We're waiting for someone from Rome. \nRIPLEY (completely thrown) What do you mean?  They're sending someone from Rome? \n", "test2_id": 3049, "test3_input": "INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. \nPeter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand. \nPETER You can't be angry with her.  She's upset and needs someone to blame. So she blames you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As for you - either get a safety razor or grow a beard. \nINT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING. \nRipley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance. \nINT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY. \nRipley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the private investigator. \nRIPLEY Is Mr Greenleaf here? \nMACCARRON Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron. \nMARGE (O/S) I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF (O/S) Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts - \nGreenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back, as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE TABLE. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Tom. \nRIPLEY Hello, sir. (smiles thinly at Marge) Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up? \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Marge has been telling us about the rings. \nRIPLEY You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday - I clean forgot - ridiculous. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn. \nRipley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf heads into his bedroom. \nHERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd) I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you. \nRIPLEY (feeling caged in) We could go down to the bar - no need for you to - \nHERBERT GREENLEAF No, he should talk to you alone. \nHe helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and indifferent view. \nEXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY. \nRipley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges. \nRIPLEY I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it? \nMACCARRON (coming out) I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it. \nRIPLEY Okay. \nMACCARRON Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half- killed a boy? \nRipley turns, shocked. \nMACCARRON (cont'd) At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the kid several times in the head. Put him in the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to ask Mr Greenleaf. \nMacCarron gets up. \nMACCARRON (cont'd) Nor did they think to check whether a Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at Princeton University. I turned up a Tom Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the music department. \n", "test3_true": "MACCARRON (cont'd) See - in America we're taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact. We're taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl was pregnant, find out if Dickie had an embarrassment there. \nRipley doesn't know where this barrage is going. \nMACCARRON (cont'd) Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows. \nRIPLEY I hope she never knows. \nMACCARRON Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman. \nHe walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES from Freddie's car. \nMACCARRON (cont'd) I found these in the basement of Dickie's apartment. They belonged to Freddie's car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose them in the canal this evening. \nRipley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream. \nMACCARRON (cont'd) Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in Dickie's letter to you which he intends to honor. He intends to transfer a good part of Dickie's income from his trust into your name. He doesn't intend to give the Italian police any information about Dickie's past. He's rather hoping you'll feel the same. \nThere is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed. \nEXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY. \nRipley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert Greenleaf carries the saxophone case. \nRIPLEY (to Marge) I feel I never should have said those things to you the other evening. I was pretty flustered, the rings and - and you looked so, I don't know. \nMarge shakes her head to silence him. \nRIPLEY (cont'd) But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day. \nMARGE What are you going to do now, Tom? \nRIPLEY I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month - and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal, otherwise - \nMARGE Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day? \nRIPLEY What? \nMARGE (lunging at him) I know it was you - I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. \nRIPLEY Oh Marge. \nHe puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away. STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away. They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas. \nEXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY. \nA week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're laughing. \nRIPLEY Ask me what I want to change about this moment. \nPETER What do you want to change about this moment? \nRIPLEY Nothing. \nINT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK. \nPeter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in. \nPETER Hello.  What are you up to? \nRIPLEY All kinds of things. Making plans. \n", "test3_id": 3050}

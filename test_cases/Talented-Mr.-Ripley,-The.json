{"test1_input": "Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment before closing the door behind him. \nEXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY. \nRipley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight. He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's chauffeur. \nCHAUFFEUR Here.  I'll take that. \nRIPLEY Thanks. \nCARETAKER (nodding towards the apartment) That thousand bucks should come in handy. \nRIPLEY Yes, sir. \nCHAUFFEUR (interupts Ripley, who is about to open the car door) I'll get that. \nRIPLEY Thanks. \nCHAUFFEUR (as he holds open the door for Ripley) Sir. (Ripley laughs excitedly) You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr Greenleaf is personal friends with the Cunard people. \nINT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY. \nRipley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery. Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks and dollars. \nCHAUFFEUR I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors. \nEXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY. \nThe liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS. \nINT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY. \nITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked. Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows. Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted, escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him. \nRipley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his. \nMEREDITH What's your secret? \nRIPLEY Excuse me? \nMEREDITH No, it's just - you are American, aren't you? - no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating. \nRipley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall. \nRIPLEY Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello. \nMEREDITH Hello. \nThey are passed through immigration, head down the long stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? \nRIPLEY (thinking quickly) Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship. \nMEREDITH So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just - upstairs - weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there. \nRIPLEY My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel under my mother's name. \nMEREDITH Which is? \nRIPLEY Emily. (Meredith's bewildered) Just kidding. \n", "test1_true": "RIPLEY (nods, recognizing the name) As in the...? \nMEREDITH As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too. \nRIPLEY Randall. \nMEREDITH Right. \nThey've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in different directions. \nMEREDITH (cont'd) (offering her hand) So - partners in disguise. (looks at the signs) Bye. \nEXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON. \nA BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a cliff, mountain above, blue sea below. \nINT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON. \nRipley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a new town. People get off. \nINT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY. \nLater, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind down through a square, passing the local church. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY. \nAnd then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on their Vespas. The Driver chants - \nDRIVER MONGIBELLO! \nRipley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign. \nEXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING. \nA SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore. \nALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched on his knees and, during this, he continues his study, mouthing the Italian words. \nRIPLEY (looking at a long, lean girl about to dive) La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fianc\u00c8e has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge. \nHer partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown, beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat: \"BIRD\". \nRIPLEY (cont'd) Questo e la mia faccia..... \nThe golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the water, grins. \nRIPLEY (cont'd) This is my face. \nHe double-checks himself with the vocabulary book. \nRIPLEY (cont'd) Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la faccia di Dickie. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY. \nRipley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys turn laconically and watch him. \nRipley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies. Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up to Dickie. \nRIPLEY Dickie Greenleaf? \nDickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely. \n", "test1_id": 3048, "test2_input": "DICKIE Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom. \nAbove them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody, until he's as accurate as a taperecorder. \nEXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY. \nErmelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his pants, his rings. \nDICKIE Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast.  It's not love it's the coffee machine. \nMARGE It's the one task Dickie can do on his own - make coffee. \nDICKIE Shut up. \nMARGE Oh darling - is that for me? \nDICKIE No it's for Tom as he didn't complain. \nRIPLEY (as Dickie hands him his cup) That ring's so great. The green one. \nMARGE (delighted) Tom, I love you! (to Dickie) See! (to Ripley) I bought it for him, for his birthday. \nRIPLEY It's superb. \nDICKIE I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off - otherwise I'd give it to you. \nMARGE (flicking a crumb at him) Bastard! (to Ripley) Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks. \nDICKIE I hope it wasn't cheap. \nMARGE Oh, it was. \nRIPLEY (to Marge) I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? \nMARGE Frances? \nRIPLEY My fianc\u00c8e. \nDICKIE You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged? \nRIPLEY Your parents met her. \nDICKIE Oh God - I can just imagine - if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never going back. \nEXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY. \nThe Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him. \nRIPLEY I'm doing this wrong, aren't I? \nDICKIE You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well. \nMARGE Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open. \nDICKIE Yes please! \nShe heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley. \nRIPLEY Could we sail to Venice? \nDICKIE Sure.  I love Venice. \nRIPLEY I have to go to Venice. \n", "test2_true": "RIPLEY And Rome. \nDICKIE Do you ski? (Ripley frowns) Don't tell me - you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. (as Marge reappears) Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class? \nMARGE Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting married. We might have to invite him on our honeymoon. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY. \nMarge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met. \nMARGE Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my book, and I was always going to this cafe with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to play his saxophone outside and I would see him and he would see me, and he would play My Funny Valentine. It was only later that I realised he only knows about six songs. \nThey've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter, is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's order. \nMARGE (cont'd) (to Silvana, in Italian) Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e pane, e del prosciutto. \nSILVANA E fichi?  Come sempre? \nMARGE Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie. \nSilvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns. \nMARGE (cont'd) (back to Ripley) Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see Dickie, he starts playing My Funny Valentine, and then all of a sudden he just walks into the cafe, right in front of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had never spoken to him in my life - he said I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want you to come with me. So I did. \nAt the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana. Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him. \nMARGE (cont'd) If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together. \nDICKIE Okay. \nEXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING. \nDickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around. Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the top of the garden. \nEXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING. \nDickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated. \nSILVANA Did you get my message?  I want to talk to you. \nDICKIE I want to talk to you too...Smile for me. \nAnd Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill. \nEXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING. \nDickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie. \nDICKIE You're breaking my ribs! \nRIPLEY What? \nDICKIE You're breaking my ribs! \nINT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT. \nRipley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley. \nINT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT. \nA NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare. \n", "test2_id": 3049, "test3_input": "MARGE I hope so. \nPETER (to Marge) That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said - (to Ripley) Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie - \nRIPLEY My God. \nPETER But the point is Dickie - well we know this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... \nRIPLEY It's fantastic. (to Peter) I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty. \nINT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY. \nRipley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley explores, relishing the decor. \nSIGNORA BUFFI Accendo il riscaldamento. (I'll turn the heating on.) \nRIPLEY (mimes playing sax) Mi piace suonare. (I like to play music.) \nSIGNORA BUFFI (shrugs) Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace? (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So, do you like it?) \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON. \nRipley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas. There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a glass, pours himself a drink. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON. \nRipley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous. \nRIPLEY Hello? \nFREDDIE (O/S) Dickie? \nRIPLEY Who is it? \nFREDDIE (O/S) It's Freddie. Let me in. \nRIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint. \nFREDDIE (O/S) Dickie, come on, it's me. \nRipley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the door. \nRIPLEY Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley. \nFREDDIE (confused, not pleasantly) Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you? \nRIPLEY Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it? \nFREDDIE I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. \nRIPLEY I guess. \nFREDDIE The landlady - as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now. \nRIPLEY He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you. \nFREDDIE Because he's been hiding from me - what happened at Christmas? \nRIPLEY What about Christmas? \nFREDDIE He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart. \nRipley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers. \n", "test3_true": "FREDDIE Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him play that thing? (gesturing at the sax on its stand) He can't. \nRIPLEY (O/S) (casually) How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink? \nFREDDIE No thanks. (explaining his detective work) Some kid at the American Express Office. (he starts to explore) Are you living here? \nNow he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano. \nRIPLEY (returning, flinching) No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob - \nFREDDIE (O/S) Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so bourgeois. \nNow he's poking at the Hadrian bust. \nRIPLEY You should watch that! \nFREDDIE In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you. \nRIPLEY Hardly. \nFREDDIE Have you done something to your hair? \nRipley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room. \nRIPLEY Freddie, do you have something to say? \nFREDDIE What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity - or to something else. \nRIPLEY I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso. \nFREDDIE Is it on \"delle Croce, just off the Corso\"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you. \nAND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back to the door, opens it and looks over the rail. \nINT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY. \nFREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley can't make out the text but there's some discussion about Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY. \nFreddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches in, he launches into his interrogation. \nFREDDIE Ripley? There's someth - \n- AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE. \nFreddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor. THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF. \nEXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT. \nIt's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat. \nRIPLEY (mimicking Freddie's voice) Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her husband's saying. \nEXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT. \nThe Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car, Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body. He slows near a clump of trees. \nINT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING. \nSomeone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it, finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand. \n", "test3_id": 3050}

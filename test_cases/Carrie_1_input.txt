COLLINS (gesturing to his seat) May I? 
Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied. 
COLLINS Carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that. 
CARRIE I can't forget it. (beat) But it's over with. It's over. 
Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number 足 slow, romantic. 
COLLINS I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you? 
CARRIE It's very... nice. 
COLLINS (smiling) Just nice? 
CARRIE No. There's more. I don't know... (hesitating; then) ...it's like being on Mars. 
COLLINS You'll never forget it. 
CARRIE I think you're right. 
And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly. 
CARRIE Thank you. 
COLLINS Have a lovely time, Carrie. 
TOMMY (o.s.) Hey, what's going on here? 
There is Tommy, looking "stern." 
TOMMY (to Collins) What are you doing with my date? 
COLLINS Girl secrets. 
A smile at Carrie, and she goes off. 
TOMMY Don't let me catch you hugging any guys. 
CARRIE You won't. 
TOMMY Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early? 
CARRIE I promised. 
TOMMY Okay. I understand. 
CARRIE I'm sorry. 
TOMMY No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom 足 
CARRIE (breaking in) That's okay. 
TOMMY What is? 
CARRIE You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything... 
TOMMY Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier? 
CARRIE (surprised; she'd love to) I've never been there. 
TOMMY Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! (he means it) Then it's settled. 
He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor. 
CARRIE (holding back) Tommy... 
TOMMY C'mon... 
CARRIE I don't... I can't... I... 
TOMMY You can. 
He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man of considerable confidence 足 the best part of his popularity 足 and it's a contagious trait. Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom. 
190 A CORNER OF THE GYM 
Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is immediately embarrassed. 
TOMMY Hey... 
CARRIE I'm sorry. 
TOMMY I... 
CARRIE It's just... 
TOMMY No harm, no foul. 
They stand there for a couple of seconds. 
And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A bird peck. 
And again they stand there, until: 
CARRIE I don't know... anything. I can't dance...

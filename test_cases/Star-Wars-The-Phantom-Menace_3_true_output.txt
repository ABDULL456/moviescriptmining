BRAVO TWO : What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside. RIC OLIE : I don't know, we didn't hit it. BRAVO THREE : Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!! 
EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY 
Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over. 
JAR JAR : Wierdind...

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY 
RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as thye exit their ships. 
BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted the main reactor... BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy. 
ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship. 
RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship? 
ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in amazement. 
ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I? 
ARTOO beeps. oh. oh. 
INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY 
The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the NEIMOIDIANS. 
PADME : Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this. CAPT. PANAKA : I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye. 
The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS. 
The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN. 
AMIDALA : Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to see you again. PALPATINE : It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic. 
OBI-WAN greets YODA and the OTHER JEDI as CAPTAIN PANAKA takes the NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser. 
INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY 
The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of the room. 
YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not. OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon. YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training. OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must. YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be. 
EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET 
QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to OBI-WAN. 
OBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go. ANAKIN : What will happen to me now? OBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise. 
To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

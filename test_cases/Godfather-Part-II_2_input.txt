FREDO That's what I'm here for. 
MICHAEL Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana. 
FREDO Count on me; that's my specialty. 
MICHAEL I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days. 
FREDO Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em. (then a thought strikes him) Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad. 
INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY 
Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that Fredo had brought. 
A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his wife waits nervously. 
DOCTOR (Spanish) You must not exert yourself; I will write out a prescription and come back tomorrow. 
HOTEL MAN He's going to write a prescription. 
ROTH I want my own doctor; fly him in from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English. 
The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man, who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife. 
ROTH Honey, go down to the casino? 
TERRI If you feel better... 
ROTH I do.  Play the Bingo game. 
They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain. 
ROTH My sixth sense tells me you have a bag full of money in your hand. 
Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling its contents on the card table. 
MICHAEL This doubles my investment. 
ROTH Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come. 
MICHAEL Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution. 
Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over and over again. 
ROTH You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station. 
MICHAEL I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you? 
ROTH Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting. 
MICHAEL Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed? 
ROTH (taken a bit off-balance) Why...the Rosato Brothers. 
MICHAEL I know that; but who gave the go ahead. 
Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael has begun to suspect him. 
MICHAEL I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you. 
ROTH There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business. 
He regards Michael silently a moment. 
ROTH (continuing) There's three million dollars on that table.  I'm going to lie down, maybe take a nap.  When I wake up, if it's still there, I'll know I have a partner.  If it's gone, then I'll know I don't. 
The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his bedroom. 
INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY 
Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor. 
MICHAEL (Sicilian) How sick do you think the old man is? 
BUSSETTA (Sicilian) He'll live longer than me. 
INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT 
A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA. 
MED. VIEW 
At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other tropical planting with artificial stars. 
Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby. 
FREDO Does everyone know everyone, or nobody knows nobody.  Here, my brother, Michael Corleone... well, you know Senator Geary. 
Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand. 
SENATOR GEARY Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we can spend this time together. 
FREDO This is Senator Payton from Florida; Judge DeMalco from New York... Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from California, he's a lawyer with the Price-Control Administration.  And Fred Corngold of U T&T. 
They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray of drinks appears. 
FREDO Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it. 
SENATOR GEARY I'll take a Yolanda. 
Laughter. 
FREDO Later, later.  All those girls look like they're on stilts! 
The various tropical drinks are distributed. 
SENATOR GEARY To a night in Havana! 
They all join in. 
FREDO (aside to Michael) Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time. 
MICHAEL I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother. 
INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT 
By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold. 
CORNGOLD Our information is that Castro is dead.  There are maybe a few hundred die-hards in the Sierra Muestra; but government troops are going to clean them out any day. 
Johnny Ola approaches Michael. 
OLA Mike, can I talk to you. 
Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them. 
OLA Listen, this Senator from Florida already has a hundred grand worth of markers on the table. 
We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar bets on the Bank. 
OLA They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished. 
MICHAEL Let him gamble.

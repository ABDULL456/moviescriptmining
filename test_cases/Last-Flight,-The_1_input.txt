BILL (with a wave, to Frink) Thank you. 
A waiter joins them as they settle in. 
SHEP Hello, Cary. 
CARY Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have to drink? 
FRANCIS Martini! 
BILL Martini! 
SHEP Martini! 
FRINK Martini! 
WAITER Quatre Martinis? 
NIKKI Uh, could I have champagne, please? 
WAITER Champagne? Oui. 
The waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look. 
BILL Boys, she's goin' to be a problem. 
NIKKI (explains, to Bill) That's what I started on. (to Cary) It upsets me if I change over to anything else. 
CARY (to Bill) There's a lot of things wrong with this one. (to Nikki) What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway? 
SHEP Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there? 
FRANCIS There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back. 
NIKKI Can't read signs. 
SHEP Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all. 
BILL Do you think she's good-lookin' enough? 
NIKKI Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but-- 
CARY But what? 
NIKKI But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon. 
Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying to start a fire. 
BILL Then there's her drinking. 
NIKKI What's the matter with my drinking? 
BILL You're a sissy drinker. 
NIKKI Well, maybe I can improve. 
Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth. 
BILL Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 'em is turned sideways. 
NIKKI (points) You mean this one? 
BILL That's it. 
CARY Why don't you have it turned around? 
NIKKI I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help. 
CARY Well, in what respect does it kind of help? 
NIKKI Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don't let anyone kiss me -- hard. 
The men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne. 
CARY Well, we'll let that pass. 
Bill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room. 
NIKKI Where's he gone? 
CARY Shep went off to sharpen his skates. 
BILL Now, about your nose. 
NIKKI What about my nose?

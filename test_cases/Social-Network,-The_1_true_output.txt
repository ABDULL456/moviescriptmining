SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of the steps to the police station.'The LAWYER we've seen before is standing in back of him. 
SEAN 
(INTO PHONE) Listen, something's happened. We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of the conversation. 
MARK 
(PAUSE) Shit. 
SEAN It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything. I mean, I've got allergies so I can't---- We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens... 
MARK 
Back on SEAN's side- 
SEAN I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think it was Michael Moritz. 
MARK 
(EVENLY) This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna. be online any second. 
SEAN 
(BEAT) I know. 
MARK 
(BLANK) You know with anunderage intern and-- 
SEAN It's cool, I've got it under control. 
MARK 
(NO PANIC) I'll get it under control. I'll call our guys and see what the next move is. But this is gonna be news now. 
SEAN You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have me followed? 
MARK (cool as ice) Go home, Sean. I'll call our people. MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment. He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's a box. He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He takes one of the business cards out and looks at it. I'm CEO ...Bitoh And over this we HEAR a woman's voice... 
MARYLIN (V.0.) Mark? 
CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT 
MARK is sitting alone.-in the conference room. The only one left is MARYL?N,whose voï¿½.ce we just. heard. The lightp of the San Francisco skyline fill the huge picture windows. 
MARYLIN Mark? MARK looks up at her... 
MARYLIN (CONT'D) Everyone's gone, MARK doesn't say anything... 
MARYLIN (CONT'D) We're done for the day, 
MARK 
(PAUSE) Who would you rather he? 
MARYLIN I'm sorry? 
MARK My lawyer or their lawyer? 
MARYLIN 
(SMILES) Something tells me over the long run there's more money in being your lawyer. What happened to Sean? 
MAIM He cashed out most of his stock. Hey listen, all you had all day was that salad. You want to get something to eat? 
MARYLIN I can't. 
MARK I'm not a bad guy. 
MARYLIN I know that. I like you. 
MARK What happens now? 
MARYLIN Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm having a steak. Then they'll come back, up to the office and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you. 
MARK They're gonna want to settle? 
MARYLIN Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay some bonus money too. 
MARK Why? 
MARYLIN 'Cause you're gonna need these guys to sign a non-disclosure agreement and you're gonna need to be indemnified. They say one unflattering word about you in public and you own their house, wife and kids. 
MARK I invented Facebook. 
MARYLIN I'm talking about what a jury'll see. .That's what I do, that's what I'm doing here. I'm trying to specialize in voir dire--jury selection. Clothes, hair, wedding ring, speaking style, likability-- 
MARK Likability? 
MARYLIN I've been licensed to practice law for all of-20 months and I could get a jury to believe you planted the story about Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the question. Watch. Why weren't you at the sorority party that night? 
MARK You think I'm the one who called the police? 
MARYLIN - Doesn't matter, I asked the question and now everybody's thinking about it. You lost the jury in the first 10 minutes. 
MARK 
(PAUSE) Farm animals? 
.MARYLIN Yeah, 
MARK I was drunk and angry and stupid. 
MARYLIN And blogging. 
(PAUSE) Pay the fine. Get your parking validated. Get out of it. That's what Sy and the guys'll tell you in the morning. 
MARK Would anyone mind it I stayed and used the computer for a minute? 
MARYLIN No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay as long as you want. 
MARK Thanks. I appreciate your help today, 
MARYLIN You're not an asshole, Mark. You just want to be. 
MARYI,IN, who's been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase and exits. 
MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook. He -types a name in the-search box: "Erica Albright". Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook. 
He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: "Send a Message." and "Add as a Friend". 
He clicks on "Add as a Friend".

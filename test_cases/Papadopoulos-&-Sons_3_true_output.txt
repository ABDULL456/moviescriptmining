HARRY Did you do this? 
JAMES It was for you. And Uncle Spiros. And Mum. 
HARRY Thank you James. 
JAMES points out the English Ivy in the Union Jack pot that HARRY brought back from the old house. 
JAMES This is the Ivy you saved, that night. 
HARRY We meet again. 
KATIE and THEO appear at the entrance to the roof terrace. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Did you know about this? 
JAMES They can all go back to the house if you want. The plants. They're quite easy to move. But they're also very happy to grow here as well. If we choose to stay. 
HARRY looks towards KATIE and THEO. 
KATIE It's whatever you want to do Daddy. We're all really proud of you. The family embrace.

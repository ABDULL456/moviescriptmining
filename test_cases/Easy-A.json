{"test1_input": "OLIVE (CONT'D) It was... Normal. Nothing freaky. It was sweet. HE was sweet. \nRHIANNON Was he big? Did it hurt? \nOLIVE No. It was great. Like I said. Okay, that's enough. \nThe toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT (16), an Aryanesque, cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust. \nRHIANNON What the fuck are you looking at, Marianne? \nMARIANNE Nothing. Just a couple of admitted whores. \nMarianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission. \nOLIVE So, how was your weekend? \n(I promise it's the last time...) \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nThe Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting WEINERS. Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there. \nMR. ABERNATHY Wienie, Rhi? \nRhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE Marianne Bryant, as we all know, is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus. God's honest. I'm sure it's in some medical dictionary somewhere. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR \nMarianne and her lackey, NINA HOWELL (16), who's just as awful as she is, pass out flyers. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Last year's cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot, which she spearheaded. \nMarianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing students faces. \nINT. GYM - LAST YEAR \nThe school's MASCOT (17), a SHIRTLESS MUSCULAR KID painted BLUE and costumed as a DEVIL, bursts into the auditorium and begins to rile students up by thrusting his PITCHFORK in the air. \nMASCOT Blue Devils! Blue Devils! Blue Devils! \nThe crowd goes wild. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR - CONTINUOUS \nMarianne, melodramatically, grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the arm. \nMARIANNE How can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as satan worshippers? \nThe scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Now, thankfully, we're the much less intimidating -- \nINT. GYM - LAST YEAR - MONTHS LATER \nThe mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into the gym dressed as a -- \nOLIVE (V.O.) Meerkat. \nMASCOT Go meerkats! Go meerkats! \nHe can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands applauding proudly. \nThe school band is playing `GOLDFINGER.' \nAcross the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon. \nRHIANNON What the fuck is a meerkat anyway? \n", "test1_true": "RHIANNON I think I speak for all of the female students and faculty - and maybe a couple of males - when I say that I liked Todd much better when he was shirtless. I actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of -- what do they call it? \nOLIVE School spirit. \nRHIANNON Yeah. That's it. \nOLIVE Even dressed as a meerkat, I still fantasize about him. \nRHIANNON Ha! What are those people called again? The ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it? \nOLIVE Communists. \nRhiannon laughs. \nRHIANNON Shhh. Don't let Marianne hear you say that word. The last thing we need is McCarthyism at Barbara Bush. \nOLIVE Isn't high school already a hotbed of just that? \nRHIANNON True. (Beat.) Yeah, I'd totally fuck Meerkat Todd. \nThey both get lost in the thought. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE So, of course, immediately I knew that the little white lie I told to my then-best-friend in the ladies room would come back to bite me on the ass. However, even I - who my fourth grade teacher stated on my report card `has an imagination that should be quickly expunged' - had no idea how quickly this article of fiction would spread. So, now we move on to Part Two: The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nOlive loads books into her locker. She sees Marianne walk past with Nina. They give her a repulsed look. \nOlive decides to nip this in the bud. She catches up to them. \nOLIVE Hey Marianne, can I talk to you for a second? \nNina, reluctantly, gives them a moment alone. \nMARIANNE (EXASPERATED) What? \nOLIVE Listen, what you heard in the bathroom, that wasn't true. It's actually a funny story. Do you ever watch `The Brady Bunch'? \nMARIANNE Olive - that's your name, right? \nOlive knows that Marianne knows her name, but obligingly nods. \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) I'm not the one you have to answer to for your depraved behavior. There is a higher power to judge your indecency. \nOLIVE (JOKINGLY) Who? The guidance counselor? \nMARIANNE (ICILY) I hope for your sake, God has a sense of humor. \nOLIVE Oh, I have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that He does. \nOlive looks over and sees that Nina is talking to a group of GUYS, who are looking at Olive, intrigued. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (SOTTO VOCE) Damn it. \nMarianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at Olive, coldly. \nMARIANNE Look. You've made your bed. I just hope for your sake, you cleaned the sheets. \nShe turns on her heels and leaves Olive behind. \nOLIVE (TO HERSELF) Did I just get saved? \nShe shakes off her attempt and continues on her way, walking past the guys who smile at her. This alarms her. \nGUY IN HALL Hey Olive. How's it going? \nWithout stopping -- \nOLIVE I'm swell, guy-I've-never-laid-eyes- on-before. Thanks for asking. \n", "test1_id": 1395, "test2_input": "OLIVE (CONT'D) (Ashamed of herself) I should probably go. \nShe rushes off. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE It was truly my Cindy Mancini moment. (MELODRAMATICALLY REENACTING) `You! Even Bobby thinks we went out. Great, huh? Ha! All of you thought we were a couple. What a joke!... Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him. What a deal, huh? $1,000 to go out with him for a month. This guy. Oh, God. He bought me. And he bought all of you. He was sick and tired of being a nobody. Yeah, and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out. And I didn't believe that. I was, like, no way! And he was right! No, leave me alone. He was right. Our little plan worked, didn't it, Ronald? The dance. That stupid dance! What a bunch of followers you guys are. I mean, at least I got... At least I got paid.' (Sincerely; as herself) `Can't Buy Me Love' is one of the best movies ever made. Hands down. You guys should totally watch it if you haven't already. Or even if you have. Seriously fine filmmaking. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nOlive lays on her bed watching the scene from `Can't Buy Me Love' that she just performed. She eats a candy bar and wallows in her self-pity. \nOLIVE (To the television) Oh, Cindy Mancini. It could have been a lot worse. Trust me. \nHer mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift. \nROSEMARY That kid from the other night just dropped this off for you. \nIndicating an empty space on the floor -- \nOLIVE Put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors. \nROSEMARY He seems like a nice boy... Gay... \nOLIVE A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual that boy is. \nRosemary puts the gift on the floor. \nROSEMARY I dated a homosexual in high school. \nOLIVE We're not dating, Mom. \nROSEMARY I just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy, it might be hard on your father and I, at first. But we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex partner. \nRosemary leaves, chuckling at her own joke. \nToo curious, Olive opens the gift. She withdraws a PHOTO of the BULLY holding BRANDON'S LEGS while he does a KEG STAND. She smiles, pleasantly. \nShe pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR and looks at it quizically. \nThere's an envelope inside. She opens it and pulls out a $200 Gift Card to TARGET. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Cindy Mancini gets $1,000. I get a vibrator and a $200 Gift Card to Target. \nThere's a note, which she reads aloud to herself. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Dear Olive, The dildo is just in case you don't shop at Target. Then you can fuck yourself. \nOlive breaks out into riotous laughter. She's genuinely touched by this gift. \nThe phone rings. Thinking it's Brandon, Olive snatches it up. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (EXCITEDLY) Your package was perfection! \nRHIANNON (O.S.) So, it's TRUE! \nOLIVE Rhi? \nRHIANNON (O.S.) Well, it's not last night's conquest! \nOLIVE You know, I always think it's so ridiculous on TV, when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know who's going to be on the other end. I usually preface a conversation with `hello' to avoid such banalities. The one time I decide to step outside this convention... How are you? \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRhiannon, clutching an enormous Diet Coke, plods through the mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and didn't bother to tell them. \nRHIANNON I have many questions, obviously. \nWE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS: \nOLIVE (PLAYFULLY) Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. No, in fact, I do NOT know the way to San Jose. And - little known fact - contrary to popular belief, panama hats are not from Panama at all! They're from Ecuador! Who knew? \n", "test2_true": "OLIVE You're putting me in a precarious position, because -- (With her best Jackie-O VOICE) -- `according to last month's Cosmopolitan Magazine, we should always look cute. Even when we're doing mundane activities such as choosing vegetables from the produce section of our local grocery store.' \nRHIANNON Olive, stop it. This is serious. Did you really bang Brandon last night at Melanie Dipshit's party? \nOlive sighs as she slumps into her pillows. \nOLIVE Is that what people are saying happened? \nRHIANNON That's what EVERYONE is saying. \nOLIVE Then I guess it's true. \nRHIANNON Does this mean you guys are dating? \nOLIVE God no. \nRhiannon screams in frustration, attracting the attention of passing shoppers. \nRHIANNON Just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go around screwing everybody! \nOLIVE (OFF-PUT) Uh, thanks Mom. Good talk. \nRHIANNON You're getting a reputation. \nOLIVE Y'know, you're really coming off as a little pious right now and you're kind of pissing me off. \nRHIANNON Please forgive my rectitude, but I think that a best friend's duty is to let her know that everyone - and I do mean everyone - is calling her a cum dumpster. \nOLIVE Well, do YOU think I'm a cum dumpster? \nRHIANNON Look, baby, I call a spade a spade. \nEntering the red zone -- \nOLIVE First off, that's racist. Secondly, fuck you! How dare you? I was Laura Ingalls to your Lady Chatterly and, now all of a sudden, YOU feel the need to warn ME that I'M making a fool of myself? There are a lot of children who will never again experience Family Pizza Night because of you. So, why don't you jump off your high horse and splash around in the gutter where you belong. \nRHIANNON I didn't want to believe it, but I guess it's true. You're a fucktart. \nOLIVE And you're a jealous virgin. \nRHIANNON Oh yeah. I totally want to lose my virginity to one of -- (As if it was a disease) -- your brother's friends and then be the first for a fairy, while everyone listens outside! What is wrong with you? Does sex mean anything to you? \nOLIVE Yes! It's a period of time, how ever short, that I don't have to talk to you! \nShe slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes. \nBerlin's `SEX (I'm A...)' plays loudly as... \nShe goes into her closet and starts, wildly, pulling down clothes. She throws them into a big pile in the middle of her floor. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto her webcam -- \nOLIVE Rhiannon Abernathy only wishes that somebody wanted to pretend to sleep with her! \nBACK TO: \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOlive - visibly upset - is cutting something, meticulously, out of RED FABRIC. In fact, she has yards of red fabric draped across her lap. \nWhen she finishes the shape, she tosses it behind her and begins another one. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - LATER \nOlive sews these red scraps to her clothes. When she finishes one piece, as before, she tosses it behind her and grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor. \nTime flies and we see the clothing pile rapidly decreasing, until there are none left. \nThe song morphs into -- Tommy James and the Shondell's `CRIMSON & CLOVER' as we fade into -- \nINT.

Everyone thinks I'm a whore and, for the first time, I'm starting to believe it. \nMEERKAT TODD Huh? \nOLIVE Oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me. \nMEERKAT TODD I know what people are saying. Doesn't mean I believe them. \nOLIVE Why not? \nMEERKAT TODD Olive, contrary to popular belief, I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on and I know exactly what you're doing. \nShe stops crying. \nOLIVE Who told you? \nMEERKAT TODD No one had to tell me. All I know is once upon a time, there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasn't ready for his first kiss and there was this amazing little girl who lied for him. \nShe smiles through her tears. \nOLIVE You remember that? \nMEERKAT TODD Yeah and after I ran out, you pulled Brandon in. Yeah, I know about that, by the way. \nOLIVE And look how he turned out. \nMEERKAT TODD Sometimes I still pretend you were my first kiss. \nOLIVE (LAUGHING) Yeah? Who was? \nMEERKAT TODD Your friend. Rhiannon. \nOlive's laughter turns to rage. \nOLIVE What!? \nMEERKAT TODD Yeah. About a year later. It sucked. \nOLIVE (Blurting it out) She knew how I felt about you! \nMEERKAT TODD How do you feel about me? \nOLIVE (IGNORING HIM) She did it first! And here I am feeling SOOOO bad and THAT BITCH! \nMEERKAT TODD Wait. How do you feel about me? \nOLIVE (AGGRESSIVELY DEFENSIVE) Felt! I said FELT! \nMEERKAT TODD (DISAPPOINTED) Oh. \nHe stops the car. They're at her house. \nOLIVE (Off his look) I mean, it's not that I don't still feel that way. \nThere's an awkward moment between them. \nMEERKAT TODD Olive. If I promise not to tell anyone, could I kiss you? \nDespite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life, Olive looks down. \nOLIVE No. Not tonight. I don't want you to kiss me when mascara's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half-hour ago. I've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade, but I want it to be perfect. And right now, my life's a mess. I need to get it under control before I drag you into it. \nMEERKAT TODD What if I told you I wanted to be dragged into it? Maybe I could help. \nHe holds out his hand and she takes it. \nOLIVE Now I have a reason to fix this catastrophe I've brought upon myself. And I'm going to. \nMEERKAT TODD Okay. \nHe smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him. She hops out of the car and goes to her front door. \n", "test3_true": "Into her webcam -- \nOLIVE You see, now I had a reason for things to go back to the way that they were. (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) The truth needed to be told and I knew I had to go the one person who could help me. The one person I could count on to set the story straight. Brandon. I'd helped him and, even though it would destroy his new reputation for being a stud, I knew he would help me. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nFilling the frame, a GOSSIPY GIRL in braces says -- \nGOSSIPY GIRL Oh my God, did you hear that Brandon ran away from home? Yeah. Totally. He left his parents a note that said: `Eff you, I'm gay.' And then he skipped town with a big, hulking black guy. \nWe spin around to see Olive's stunned reaction. \nOLIVE (TO HERSELF) My apologies to Mark Twain. \nGOSSIPY GIRL Huh? \nThe reality of the situation begins to weigh on her. \nOLIVE Nothing. \nDefeated, Olive makes her way through the crowded halls. \nOLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It gets worse. Due to his `condition,' Micah was sent on an extended visit to his grandparents in Mississippi. \nINT. STUFFY OLD HOUSE IN MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nMicah, beyond miserable, sits between his STERN GRANDPARENTS, who read the Bible to him. \nOLIVE (V.O.) No telephone, no television, no computer, no internet and - most importantly - no diseased sexual partners. \nMicah settles in for a very long visit. \nINT. UNDER THE BLEACHERS - GYM - DAY \nWhere they had previously met, Olive pleads with Evan. \nOLIVE (V.O.) I went to everyone I'd helped and begged them to say it wasn't true. \nEVAN No way. I gave you money. \nOLIVE Please, Evan. \nHe walks off, leaving her alone. \nINT. GUIDANCE OFFICE - DAY \nOlive waits for Mrs. Griffin's response. There's a long moment of contemplation on Mrs. Griffin's part. Then -- \nMRS. GRIFFIN Olive, life is full of choices. I made a bad one. But then, so did you. We both acted unwisely, but I don't see any other alternative than to live with the guilt. My guilt stems from my indiscretion, yours for lying. We've made our choices. Now, we have to ride them out. \nOLIVE (Pissed as hell) Or I could just tell everyone THE TRUTH. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Fine, Olive. Let's play the `who do you believe' game. But, first, ask yourself, if you were an adult, who would you believe? \nOLIVE With all due respect, Mrs. Griffin, you're a fucking cunt. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Because you helped me once, I'm not going to report that to Principal Gibbons. Now, we're even. \nThey're locked in a Mexican standoff. \nMRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) You can go now. \nFurious, Olive throws the door open and exits. \nINT. MR. GRIFFIN'S CLASSROOM - DAY \nMr. Griffin is erasing the blackboard, when Olive storms into the room. \nOLIVE Your wife has chlamydia and she's been sleeping with a student and she gave it to him and now she's trying to blame me. \nShocked, Mr. Griffin drops the eraser. \n", "test3_id": 1397}

{"train": "EASY \"A\" \nWritten by \nBert V. Royal \nFIRST DRAFT August 3, 2008 \nIN DARKNESS: \nOLIVE (V.O.) The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated. \nFADE IN: \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOLIVE PENDERGHAST (17), a cute teenager, speaks directly into the WEBCAM atop her computer. \nOLIVE Let the record show that I, Olive Penderghast, being of sound mind, ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke, do enter this video blog into evidence in the case against me. Because I'm being judged by a jury of my peers, I will attempt to insert `like' and `totally' into my confession as much as possible. So here it goes... I confess I'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my Varsity letter scarlet, but - for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll be gravely disappointed. (Beat.) Look, I just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that, than to broadcast it on the Internet. So, here it is -- Part One: The Shudder-Inducing and Cliched, However Totally False Account Of How I Lost My Virginity To A Guy At A Community College In A Neighboring Town. (Beat.) Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story. This is my side, the right one. (Beat.) Like, totally. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nOlive sits with her best friend, RHIANNON ABERNATHY (17), a brash teenager. It would be safe to say that these girls are definitely on the \"B List\" at their school. \nRHIANNON Fuck off! George is not a `sexy' name. George is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm. \nOLIVE That's bullshit. There are lots of sexy Georges. \nRHIANNON Name three. \nOlive starts to say something, but Rhiannon interrupts her. \nRHIANNON (CONT'D) Besides Clooney. Too easy. \nOLIVE Shouldn't that alone be enough? \nRHIANNON Fine. That's one. Number two? \nOLIVE (THINKING) Okay. George... Ummmm... Reeves! \nRHIANNON Who's that? \nOLIVE Superman. From way back. He was hot. \nRHIANNON No way. Teddy bear. \nOLIVE Bullshit. Ben Affleck played him in that movie! \nRHIANNON So what? Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer. Besides he's from another century. (MORE) \nRHIANNON (CONT'D) We're speaking present day. I mean, Jesus, Mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era. \nOLIVE George Stephanopolous. \nRHIANNON What are you? Fifty? \nOLIVE (THINKING HARD) George... \nRHIANNON Bush? Yeah. He's one hot mutherfucker. Just face it. There's no such thing as a sexy George. \nOLIVE Well, mine is. So, I think we should just put this conversation to bed. \nRHIANNON Fine. Don't come. I hate you. \nRhiannon folds her arms and pouts. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOlive continues to narrate into her webcam. \nOLIVE Let me back up. I don't know if any of you have ever met them, but Rhiannon's parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius. \nINT. THE ABERNATHY LIVING ROOM \nRHIANNON What's his name then? \nOLIVE (WAXING CUTE) Who? My brother? \nRHIANNON Stop stalling. You're totally trying to come up with a name. Just say it. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE I'm not proud of this. Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it. Okay, have you guys ever watched `The Brady Bunch'? Of course you haven't. You're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on MTV. That's why I knew I could get away with it. See, there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved. The name of her imaginary boyfriend WAS -- \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nOLIVE (Into the phone) George Glass. \nRHIANNON George? What kind of a fucking name is George? \nOLIVE He's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so I said yes. \nAlthough still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified. \nRHIANNON If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth. \nOLIVE Deal. \nINT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS \nRhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth. \nRHIANNON (With her mouth full) You're not off the hook, you know. I want lurid details. This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine. \nOLIVE I'm sure you'll have a good time. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nRhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nTo her webcam -- \nOLIVE (Through the proverbial CLENCHED TEETH) Even though we now hate each other, Rhi, I really hope you're watching this. Because this part's for you. The lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all-too- imaginary, yet surprisingly satisfying George Glass: \nKen Nordine's beat poem `OLIVE,' (from the late 60's album `Colors'), underscored to jazz, plays as we see a montage of OLIVE'S WEEKEND: \nIn her bedroom, Olive -- \n-- watches `The Notebook,' pining over Ryan Gosling. \nKEN NORDINE (V.O.) Olive. Poor thing. \n-- paints her toenails Jungle Red. \nKEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sits and thinks that it's drab. Sure does. Sits and sits and sits and sits and THINKS about it's olive drab drab. \n-- dances to the jazz music, but alone, in her underwear and a t-shirt that declares: `Hands off.' \nKEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) DOESN'T KNOW that it is about to be named `Color of the Year,' by those with the nose for the new. By the passionate few. Yeah... \n-- reads TEEN PEOPLE magazine. \nKEN NORDINE (CONT'D) Olive is definitely in. EVERYTHING that can possibly mean (MORE) \nKEN NORDINE (CONT'D) anything! Anywhere! At least for a year. \n-- dances some more. \nKEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Has got to be Olive! Did you hear that Olive? Did ya? Know what it means? Oh Olive! There'll be olive cars and olive trucks and olive chickens and olive ducks and olive socks and olive garters And olive brakes and olive starters! Olive, sorry! Olive, please! OLIVE WHATNOTS and olive trees! Olive trees? What a quaint notion... Olive trees. (CHUCKLING) Olive. \nOut of breath from dancing, she walks over and displaces the NEEDLE from the KEN NORDINE ALBUM she's playing. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOLIVE (CONT'D) It was... Normal. Nothing freaky. It was sweet. HE was sweet. \nRHIANNON Was he big? Did it hurt? \nOLIVE No. It was great. Like I said. Okay, that's enough. \nThe toilet flushes and MARIANNE BRYANT (16), an Aryanesque, cardigan-wearing Christian-girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink, where she vigorously washes her hands - while staring at Rhi and Olive with disgust. \nRHIANNON What the fuck are you looking at, Marianne? \nMARIANNE Nothing. Just a couple of admitted whores. \nMarianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom. Olive's stomach revolves at her now-turned-public admission. \nOLIVE So, how was your weekend? \n(I promise it's the last time...) \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nThe Abernathys smile at the campfire, roasting WEINERS. Rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there. \nMR. ABERNATHY Wienie, Rhi? \nRhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE Marianne Bryant, as we all know, is the President of the Christian Student Coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball bat implanted up her anus. God's honest. I'm sure it's in some medical dictionary somewhere. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR \nMarianne and her lackey, NINA HOWELL (16), who's just as awful as she is, pass out flyers. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Last year's cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot, which she spearheaded. \nMarianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing students faces. \nINT. GYM - LAST YEAR \nThe school's MASCOT (17), a SHIRTLESS MUSCULAR KID painted BLUE and costumed as a DEVIL, bursts into the auditorium and begins to rile students up by thrusting his PITCHFORK in the air. \nMASCOT Blue Devils! Blue Devils! Blue Devils! \nThe crowd goes wild. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - LAST YEAR - CONTINUOUS \nMarianne, melodramatically, grabs a PASSING STUDENT by the arm. \nMARIANNE How can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as satan worshippers? \nThe scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Now, thankfully, we're the much less intimidating -- \nINT. GYM - LAST YEAR - MONTHS LATER \nThe mascot, unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous, walks into the gym dressed as a -- \nOLIVE (V.O.) Meerkat. \nMASCOT Go meerkats! Go meerkats! \nHe can't seem to get himself or the student body as excited - with the exception of Marianne and Nina, in the stands applauding proudly. \nThe school band is playing `GOLDFINGER.' \nAcross the gym, Olive sits with Rhiannon. \nRHIANNON What the fuck is a meerkat anyway? \nOLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) All I could think to myself was `Great, now I'm going to have to start wearing red lipstick and stiletto heels.' \nBattling her frustration, she goes to class. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nOlive eats dinner with her family. \nHer father, DILL (40's), is a regular dad-kinda-guy. Her mother, ROSEMARY (40's) is heavyset with a fun disposition. Also in attendance is her `a-little-too-precious' sister, GINGER (12). \nOlive and her folks get along really well. \nOLIVE Hey, you guys know that I was here all weekend, right? \nThey all nod at her. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) And you would testify to that? \nDILL (SLIGHTLY CONCERNED) What's up, sweet pea? \nOLIVE It's nothing. Just the rumor mill. \nROSEMARY What's the rumor mill turning out these days? \nOLIVE Seriously, it's nothing. \nThey continue to eat. \nROSEMARY Don't forget your brother's staying here next weekend. \nOLIVE Why? He never comes home. \nROSEMARY They're fumigating the dorms. And thank God for that. Last time I was there, I saw three cockroaches. \nGINGER (WHINY) Mom, can you please not say that word while I'm eating? \nROSEMARY Sorry, hon. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE Like all families, mine has a deep dark secret. And since I'm spilling all this dirt, I might as well go ahead and confess it. \nShe takes a deep breath. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I'm trusting that this nugget of information isn't going to be spread around, but - okay, here it goes: My dad's name is Dill and my mother's name is Rosemary. They were so amused by this that they decided to name all of their children after -- (FEIGNING DISCOMFORT) -- edible items. (With mock emotion) My brother's name is Sage and my sister's name is Ginger. It's shocking, I know. We're like a fucking pantry, us Penderghasts! (SNAPPING BACK) But at least my parents didn't meet at a `Star Trek' convention, BITCH! Sorry. Now, I'm just being mean. Okay. Back to the story. \nINT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nAs Olive walks through school, she is met with a totally different energy. She no longer blends in. Guys are checking her out. Girls are glaring at her, scornfully. \nShe's kind of digging it. \nOLIVE (V.O.) So, while I would never have classified myself as a wallflower, I was now the center of attention and who doesn't love that? Jeez, if I'd known that losing my virginity would create such a new persona for myself, I'd have lied about it back in eighth grade. Eighth grade sucked. I did get my first kiss back then, however. It was gross and kind of turned me off to the whole my-tongue-in-other- people's-mouths thing. Not to mention, the even-worse other- people's-tongues-in-MY-mouth thing. Seriously, folks. Who invented kissing? Why is everyone so dead- set on sticking their body parts in other people's orifices? If there's a hole on a person, rest assured, somebody wants to stick something of theirs in it. \nINT. CLOSET \nIn almost complete darkness, a very nervous EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (13) sits with a scared shitless EIGHTH GRADE KID (13). \nYou can hear other PRE-TEENS snickering and whispering outside the door. \nEIGHTH GRADE OLIVE So, I think this is the part where you're supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth. It's just what I've heard. \nEIGHTH GRADE KID Just give me a second, okay? \nOlive presses a button and her watch illuminates. \nEIGHTH GRADE OLIVE According to my watch, you have 382 of them. \nEIGHTH GRADE KID How do you do that? \nEIGHTH GRADE OLIVE What? \nOlive seems lost in thought. She snaps back to reality and the task at hand. \nOLIVE If I'd known that Meerkat Todd was going to turn out so hot, I probably would have cherished the moment more. I suppose just that I'm sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant something. (Beat.) Yeah, so anyway - kissing's not really my thing. That's what I learned in Natalie Giblin's closet. I digress... \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nOlive half-listens in class, while her English teacher MR. GRIFFIN (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `THE SCARLET LETTER.' \nOLIVE (V.O.) So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass, because everyone thinks I've been deflowered. I'm surprised at how empowered I felt by this prevarication. I wonder to myself, would I feel this invigorated if I had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach- infested dorm room? Probably not. (Beat.) Ironically, we were studying `The Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that always the way with these teenage tales? The literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted. I consider this. (Pause.) Then I think: Except for `Huckleberry Finn.' I don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy. \nMR. GRIFFIN Alright, so thoughts? \nNina raises her hand. Mr. Griffin points to her. \nNINA I think Hester Prynne was - excuse my language - a whore. \nMR. GRIFFIN You don't see her as a victim? \nNINA Why should I? She brought it on herself. \nNina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her. \nOLIVE Excuse me? \nNINA Perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe? \nOLIVE Perhaps you should GET a wardrobe, you twat! \nThe class bursts into surprised laughter. Even Mr. Griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction. \nOLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Admittedly, not my best line. But it was provocative enough to land me in the Principal's office. \nMr. Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk. He starts writing something on a piece of paper. \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nOlive sits with her arms crossed outside of the Principal's office. She clenches a note in her fist. \nMarianne, who's an office aid, has a smirk on her face as she watches Olive squirm. She slams her fist down on the stapler, repetitively. \nFINALLY -- \nMARIANNE Seems as if someone's on a downward spiral. \nOLIVE Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life. \nMARIANNE You have a chip on your shoulder the size of Texas. \nOLIVE Wow, that's even bigger than your ass. \nMARIANNE (COLDLY) You're going to hell. \nOLIVE (Growing weary of this BANTER) As long as you won't be there... \nMARIANNE Oh, I can assure you I won't. \nNeither says anything for a few moments. \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) I hope you at least had the good sense to wear a condom. \nOLIVE Why? Your parents didn't. \nMARIANNE You know, you're just like -- \nThe principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and continues her work. \nTWO KIDS emerge. One, obviously, a bully; the other, obviously, the bullied. The BULLIED kid is holding a BLOODIED TISSUE up to his nose. He and Olive exchange meaningful glances. \nPRINCIPAL GIBBONS (60's), a colossal prick disguised as a man, gestures for her to come in. Olive gets up and enters -- \nINT. PRINCIPAL GIBBONS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHe closes the door behind them. He holds his hand out and she gives him the note that Mr. Griffin wrote. Gibbons studies it. \nHer parents seem more impressed than upset. This is definitely a first. \nDILL What did you do? \nOLIVE I used inappropriate language in English class. But we're reading a book that I, personally, deem wildly inappropriate for my age group, so I felt that it was actually quite apropos. \nROSEMARY (More curious than angry) What did you say? \nOlive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud. \nOLIVE Let's just say it was an inappropriate word. \nDILL What did it start with? \nOLIVE A snide comment from a snotty-ass girl in my class. \nDILL I meant what letter did it start with? \nOLIVE Oh. Yeah. T. \nROSEMARY T? That's an odd one. Is this one of those new curse words? \nBoth her parents wheels are going. They're both seeking the answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing. \nROSEMARY (CONT'D) Was it -- ? \nShe leans over and whispers something in her daughter's ear. \nOLIVE I don't even know what that means. \nROSEMARY Yeah. Neither do I. \nHer parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to them. \nDILL Okay. Noun, adjective or verb? \nOLIVE Noun. Definitely slang. Think British, although they pronounce it differently. \nROSEMARY Well, I'm stumped. Whisper it in my ear. \nOLIVE I can't. Too weird. \nExcited by the prospect -- \nROSEMARY Oo! Oo! Spell it with your peas! \nOLIVE Now, THAT'S a challenge. \nShe begins maneuvering her peas around the plate. \nDILL Does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night? \nOlive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues to manipulate her food. \nDILL (CONT'D) Is there something you want to tell us, kiddo? \nOLIVE I'm spelling it out for you as quickly as I can. \nGINGER (Desperate for attention) I got a B plus on my spelling test today. \nToo intrigued by Olive's admission to really care -- \nROSEMARY Good, sweetheart. \nRosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the A. \nROSEMARY (CONT'D) Oh, I know what it is! \nShe leans over and whispers it in Dill's ear. He nods in understanding. \nGINGER (Glancing at Olive's PLATE) What's a twat? \nOlive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile. \nOlive laughs to herself. \nBULLIED KID What? \nOLIVE I was just thinking it's kind of funny. We haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade. \nBULLIED KID I was afraid you were going to bring that up. \nOLIVE So, how have you been, Brandon? \nBRANDON (DRYLY) I have been fantastic. (MORE) \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Really, really amazing. Don't know if you heard, but according to my locker, I'm a `power bottom.' \nOLIVE Yikes. \nBRANDON Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous label. \nOLIVE Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility? \nBrandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look. \nBRANDON But, of course, I'm in detention. \nOLIVE Why? \nBRANDON Because Gibbons is a homophobe. (Beat.) And I called him a facist. \nOLIVE So, the rumors are true, huh? \nBRANDON (INCREDULOUS) Have you ever met me? \nOLIVE No. I meant about Gibbons being a facist. \nHe laughs. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I kind of guessed it that night with the whole kissing thing. The way you ran away. I remember thinking to myself, `this isn't the first time this kid's going to go bursting out of the closet.' \nBRANDON Gold star for you, Nancy Drew. \nThere's a brief silence between them. \nOLIVE You know, I read this article that said with this whole EMO movement, it looks like - that in a few years - the gay kids are going to be the most popular ones in school. \nBRANDON Oh good. I'll come back when I'm twenty seven for my redo. \nIgnoring his cynicism -- \nOLIVE Can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to Britney, while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they were that cool? \nBRANDON That'll be the day. (Beat.) Judging from the new look you're sporting, I'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `Sup with the whore couture? \nOLIVE (PROUDLY) Haven't you heard? I'm the new school slut! \nBRANDON As a matter of fact I did hear that. I heard you banged a guy twice your age. \nOLIVE No way. He's a freshman in college. \nBRANDON Also heard he gave you crabs. \nOLIVE Ewwww. People suck. \nBRANDON Tell me about it. \nOLIVE He's not real. The guy I slept with. I made him up. \nBRANDON So, you started the rumor? \nOLIVE Indirectly? Sort of. Well, not really. No. No, I didn't. \nBRANDON But you're perpetuating it. That's fucked up. \nOLIVE (OFFENDED) Excuse me? \nShe clicks over. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Hello? \nBRANDON (O.S.) Olive? \nOLIVE (SINGSONG) Unfortunately so. \nBRANDON It's Brandon. \nOLIVE Speak of the devil... \nBRANDON (O.S.) Hey, can I come over? I wanted to talk to you about something. \nOLIVE (INTRIGUED) Okay. Yeah. Sure. \nBRANDON (O.S.) Okay. See you soon. \nOlive clicks over to Rhiannon. \nOLIVE Dude, that was Brandon. He wants to talk to me about something. \nRHIANNON (O.S.) Probably wants to borrow an outfit. \nOLIVE That's so mean. \nRHIANNON (O.S.) Any word from George? \nOLIVE Rhi, I told you. It was a one night stand. Which is now a DONE night stand. \nRHIANNON (O.S.) You're being awfully cavalier about this. I mean, he popped your cherry. Aren't you supposed to be eternally in love with him and shit? \nOLIVE If I was a character on a CW show, then, absolutely, I'd be blubbering all over my Teen Vogue. Hey, we should start a rumor that I'm having a pregnancy scare! \nOlive is stoked by her idea. \nINT. FOYER - PENDERGHAST HOME - NIGHT \nRosemary opens the door to see Brandon. She has no idea who he is. \nBRANDON Hi. Is there an Olive here? \nROSEMARY (FEIGNING CONFUSION) There's a whole jar of them in the fridge. \nBRANDON Sorry, I must have gotten the address wrong. \nROSEMARY Just kidding! Come on in. \nBrandon walks in and Rosemary shouts -- \nROSEMARY (CONT'D) Olive, sweetie, there's a young man here to see you. He said something about asking for your hand in marriage. \nBrandon's eyes bulge and Olive descends the staircase. \nOLIVE Oh happy day, Mama! I thought I was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness. \nOlive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to -- \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nShe closes the door behind them. \nOLIVE My mom's an acquired taste. I know this because I've only just recently begun to appreciate her myself. \nShe gestures for him to sit down. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Welcome to my boudoir! This is where the magic happens. \nBRANDON (BLURTING OUT) Do you wanna go out with me? \nShe looks at him, strangely. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) I mean, like -- Do you want to be my girlfriend? \nOLIVE I'm sure you all remember the party... \nINT. BOSTIC HOUSE - NIGHT \nA TEEN PARTY rages. DRUNK KIDS abound. \nOlive, looking like a million-fuckin'-bucks, prances into the party with Brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself. They appear drunk and are falling all over each other. \nPeople stare in complete amazement at a.) Their appearance and b.) That they're even together in the first place. \nYou'd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST TEEN COUPLE, ripped from the pages of Teen People. \nOlive falls against Brandon laughing. He hoists her up, as their host, MELANIE BOSTIC (17), a fairly pretty girl, approaches. \nMELANIE Hey Olive! (WEIRDED OUT) Hi Brandon. \nOLIVE OhmiGod, Melly. I hope you don't mind, but we had a few pre-cocktail party cocktails... (DISORIENTED) Party. Cocktails. \nMELANIE Well, glad you could make it. \nOLIVE (Whispering and slurring in her ear) Soooo, here's the thing. (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Brandon was in the middle of telling me this funny thing. Is there a quiet room we can go to where he can finish telling me -- (HICCUP) -- About his thing? That's funny? \nShe stares glassy-eyed at Melanie. Brandon just smiles. \nMELANIE Sure. You can use the guest room. Down the hall. \nOLIVE I love you. I love you so much. You are -- Just, yeah. \nShe gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder. \nShe spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them with complete interest. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (Loudly; to all) Hey everybody! \nThey raise a glass to them and Brandon and Olive stumble down the hallway, laughing. \nMELANIE (Shocked; Mouthing to a GUEST) What the fuck?! \nThe bully who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon, goes up to Melanie. \nBULLY Was that Olive with Brandon? \nMELANIE I know! Right? \nThey, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and Olive have just retreated to. \nINT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT \nOlive locks the door and drops the drunk act. She's completely sober and so is Brandon. \nOLIVE (WHISPERING) Draw the shades. \nBrandon runs over and pulls the blinds down. They giggle, conspiratorially. \nOlive plops down on the bed and stretches out. Brandon lays beside her. She moans for the benefit of the audience she knows has assembled outside. She moans again and it's very convincing. \nShe leans over and whispers in his ear -- \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Grunt. Make it really convincing. And manly. \nHe does so. She extends her palm, impressed. He slaps it with his. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nSure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at the door - falling all over each other to hear. Nearest to the door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the noise inside. \nINT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOlive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises. Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it, prompting him to stop. She puts her finger over her lips, giving him the `Shhhh' sign. \nShe continues to read as she thrusts her hips, making the bed squeak ever so slightly. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (Ashamed of herself) I should probably go. \nShe rushes off. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE It was truly my Cindy Mancini moment. (MELODRAMATICALLY REENACTING) `You! Even Bobby thinks we went out. Great, huh? Ha! All of you thought we were a couple. What a joke!... Ronald Miller paid me 1,000 bucks to pretend I liked him. What a deal, huh? $1,000 to go out with him for a month. This guy. Oh, God. He bought me. And he bought all of you. He was sick and tired of being a nobody. Yeah, and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out. And I didn't believe that. I was, like, no way! And he was right! No, leave me alone. He was right. Our little plan worked, didn't it, Ronald? The dance. That stupid dance! What a bunch of followers you guys are. I mean, at least I got... At least I got paid.' (Sincerely; as herself) `Can't Buy Me Love' is one of the best movies ever made. Hands down. You guys should totally watch it if you haven't already. Or even if you have. Seriously fine filmmaking. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nOlive lays on her bed watching the scene from `Can't Buy Me Love' that she just performed. She eats a candy bar and wallows in her self-pity. \nOLIVE (To the television) Oh, Cindy Mancini. It could have been a lot worse. Trust me. \nHer mom comes in with a nicely-wrapped gift. \nROSEMARY That kid from the other night just dropped this off for you. \nIndicating an empty space on the floor -- \nOLIVE Put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors. \nROSEMARY He seems like a nice boy... Gay... \nOLIVE A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual that boy is. \nRosemary puts the gift on the floor. \nROSEMARY I dated a homosexual in high school. \nOLIVE We're not dating, Mom. \nROSEMARY I just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy, it might be hard on your father and I, at first. But we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex partner. \nRosemary leaves, chuckling at her own joke. \nToo curious, Olive opens the gift. She withdraws a PHOTO of the BULLY holding BRANDON'S LEGS while he does a KEG STAND. She smiles, pleasantly. \nShe pulls out a PINK VIBRATOR and looks at it quizically. \nThere's an envelope inside. She opens it and pulls out a $200 Gift Card to TARGET. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Cindy Mancini gets $1,000. I get a vibrator and a $200 Gift Card to Target. \nThere's a note, which she reads aloud to herself. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Dear Olive, The dildo is just in case you don't shop at Target. Then you can fuck yourself. \nOlive breaks out into riotous laughter. She's genuinely touched by this gift. \nThe phone rings. Thinking it's Brandon, Olive snatches it up. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (EXCITEDLY) Your package was perfection! \nRHIANNON (O.S.) So, it's TRUE! \nOLIVE Rhi? \nRHIANNON (O.S.) Well, it's not last night's conquest! \nOLIVE You know, I always think it's so ridiculous on TV, when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know who's going to be on the other end. I usually preface a conversation with `hello' to avoid such banalities. The one time I decide to step outside this convention... How are you? \nINT. MALL - DAY \nRhiannon, clutching an enormous Diet Coke, plods through the mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and didn't bother to tell them. \nRHIANNON I have many questions, obviously. \nWE INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS: \nOLIVE (PLAYFULLY) Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. No, in fact, I do NOT know the way to San Jose. And - little known fact - contrary to popular belief, panama hats are not from Panama at all! They're from Ecuador! Who knew? \nMR. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) (Indicating her outfit) `this' is just an act. I'm just curious why you're doing it. \nOlive drops her defenses and gets real. \nOLIVE Have you ever decided just to play along? Because it's maybe easier than fighting tooth-and-nail to defend it? \nMR. GRIFFIN I just don't want to see this (He searches for the word) damage you. \nOLIVE You know, I think you should give me extra credit for going the extra mile. I'm really attempting to understand this puritanical ostracism. \nMr. Griffin smiles at her. \nMR. GRIFFIN Hey, I'm really sorry I had to send you to the Principal. If you tell anybody, I'll deny it, but I really wanted to cheer with the rest of the class. \nOLIVE (SMILING; INNOCENTLY) You know I won't tell. \nShe gets up and leaves, but passes in the doorway, a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (To the woman) Hey Mrs. Griffin. \nPretending to know who she is -- \nMRS. GRIFFIN Hi! How are you? \nOLIVE (Pointing to the `A') A is for Awesome. \nOlive disappears into the empty halls. \nMRS. GRIFFIN I've never seen that girl before in my life. \nMR. GRIFFIN That doesn't surprise me. \nMRS. GRIFFIN I'm the guidance counselor. I should know all of the students. Especially the ones dressed like that. \nHe kisses her. \nMR. GRIFFIN She's just going through a phase. (He gets an idea) Hey, do you think you could talk to her? Maybe you could get her to -- I dunno - \nMRS. GRIFFIN Sure. Yeah, whatever. Oh wait! That's not the girl that everyone's talking about, is it? \nMR. GRIFFIN `Fraid so. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Oh, this'll be good. That snotty office aid has been bitching about her incessantly. \nMR. GRIFFIN It's all lies. Talk to her. Maybe that's all she needs. \nMRS. GRIFFIN What are you making for dinner tonight? \nMR. GRIFFIN Is it my turn? \nMRS. GRIFFIN Sure is. I'm meeting up with the girls at happy hour. \nMR. GRIFFIN Don't have too much fun. \nMRS. GRIFFIN I never do. \nHe kisses her. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nAssembled in a semi-circle, a handful of WELL-DRESSED CHRISTIAN KIDS open their meeting of the CROSS YOUR HEART CLUB with prayer. Marianne, of course, leads them in this ritual. Nina is also present. \nMARIANNE Heavenly Father, watch over us with Your all-encompassing love. Keep us on the path toward Your righteousness and eternal salvation. \nThey all smile, say `AMEN' and open their eyes. \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) Guys. We have a problem. \nNINA Amen to THAT. \nMARIANNE Olive Penderghast. We need to pray for her, but we also need to get rid of her. I'm sure, by now, you've all heard about what happened at Melanie Bostic's party. \nCHRISTIAN KID #1 I was there. I heard the whole thing. \nOLIVE Am I in trouble? I promise the hem of my dress isn't higher than my fingertips. \nMRS. GRIFFIN You're not in trouble, Olive. I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me. \nOLIVE If I open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence? \nMRS. GRIFFIN Yes. \nOLIVE (CONFESSIONAL) I watch `American Idol.' Do NOT tell anyone. \nMrs. Griffin rolls her eyes. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I have a reputation to uphold. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Don't you, though? \nOlive assesses this statement from her. \nOLIVE We done? If I can think of any angsty things to report, you'll be the first to know. \nShe winks at her. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) This has been so much fun that I'm actually - at this very moment - considering meth addiction, just so I can come back and we can jaw some more. \nMRS. GRIFFIN (BITINGLY) Or you could always get pregnant? \nOLIVE I'm probably closer than either of us thinks... \nMrs. Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of CONDOMS. Feigning excitement -- \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Propho-tastic! \nMRS. GRIFFIN Please don't tell anyone I gave you these. The school board is -- \nOLIVE Puritanical and oppressive? \nMRS. GRIFFIN Conservative. \nOlive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned. \nOLIVE I don't need those. \nMRS. GRIFFIN (STERNLY) But you do. \nOlive starts to confess, but then just takes the rubbers and puts them in her own purse. \nOLIVE Thank you. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Remember: our little secret. And, hey, would you send in the next person? \nMrs. Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves. \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nMarianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed. He rubs his eyes, like he's been crying. Olive is surprised to see him there. \nOLIVE You're up, hoss. \nMARIANNE (Concerned; To Micah) It's going to be okay. \nShe gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her office. \nOLIVE (TO MARIANNE) Let me guess: drugs. \nMarianne gives her a `go away' look. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I didn't know Christians believed in guidance counsellors. (Beat.) Ooo! Ooo! Is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality? \nMarianne begins crying. \nMARIANNE No, you insensitive rhymes-with- witch! His parents are going THROUGH A (MORE) \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) (WHISPERED) divorce! \nOLIVE (V.O.) Tragedy struck in third period. \nMARIANNE Micah's in the hospital. He's in so much pain! The nurse didn't know what was wrong. \nOlive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before. \nOLIVE He'll be okay. \nMARIANNE (Tears glistening in her EYES) Really? \nOlive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nMarianne's boyfriend, Micah, writhes in pain on a hospital bed, clutching his crotch. His worried MOTHER (40's) is beside him, clutching her chest with one hand and trying to soothe him with the other. \nMICAH It hurts so bad. \nA DOCTOR enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis. \nDOCTOR Chlamydia. \nMicah and his mother both look up in shock. His mother takes both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably. \nMICAH'S MOTHER How did you get chlamydia? Who have you been sleeping with? Tell me! TELL ME! \nMicah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out: \nMICAH Olive! Olive Penderghast! \nHis mother's face fills with satisfaction. \nINT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nMicah's mother is on her cell phone. \nMICAH'S MOTHER (ANGRILY) Olive Penderghast. \nShe folds her phone up and slips it into her purse. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe woman on the other end of the phone -- A WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA -- who we've seen in the Bryant family photo, hangs up. Only this time, her smile is a disgusted grimace. \nShe picks up the phone and dials a number. She is, animatedly, talking to the person on the other end of the line, while Olive narrates. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Fourth period was when Marianne had office duty. Her duties included typing, stapling, filing and -- \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nMarianne is on the phone, listening, with mouth agape. Undoubtedly, she's just heard from her mother that her boyfriend has chlamydia. \nOLIVE (V.O.) -- answering the phones. \nMARIANNE CHLAMYDIA!! \nShe screams so loud that Mrs. Griffin comes out of her office, a panicked expression on her face. \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nSeething, Marianne's mother says into the phone -- \nA WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA Olive Penderghast. \nShe hears a slam and then a dial tone. \nINT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMarianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands. Mrs. Griffin looks worried. \nMRS. GRIFFIN Are you okay, hon? \nLike a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne quivers in rage. Finally, at boiling point, she shouts -- \nOLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And I bought it. \nOlive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and offers up a solution. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I could have chlamydia. And I could easily have given it to Micah. That time we slept together. Who knows? Often times women don't have symptoms and I have been whoring around.... \nMRS. GRIFFIN No you haven't. \nOlive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge. \nMRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) (LOOKING AWAY) Because a real whore can't admit it to herself, let alone others. \nShe begins to weep. \nOlive puts her hand on Mrs. Griffin's shoulder. \nOLIVE Call Micah. Tell him I said he's an asshole and that he owes me SO big for this and also the time I pretended not to see him during a third grade game of hide and seek. Tell him I still remember that. But tell him that I confessed to giving him chlamydia. \nMrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) And it's not really my place to say this, but I figure after the conversation we just had, I can speak candidly. Your husband is HOT and while the male adolescent can fuck like a bunny... who really wants to fuck a bunny? If I was you, I'd go home and seduce him and pretend this never happened. \nOlive strokes her guidance counselor's hair. \nMRS. GRIFFIN (SNIVELING) Do you want some more condoms? \nOLIVE (MATERNALLY) No, you keep them. \nShe strokes her hair. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE So, really how could I be angry at Marianne? (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Dude, if some bimbo gave MY boyfriend an STD, I'd have swung, but I'd have balled my fist. (WHIMSICALLY) My boyfriend. (She gets lost in the THOUGHT) With all the mythical play I was getting, it's a wonder - and probably a miracle - that I still hadn't actually been asked out on a real date. Guys were clamoring to claim that they'd slept with me, but no one was putting the real moves on me. Until finally... \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE \nTwo LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a LITTLE BOY all over the playground, desperate to kiss him. \nThey plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast. \nOLIVE (V.O.) It was really Rhiannon who had a crush on him. She has since we were kids. \nRhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek. Repulsed, he wipes his face. \nRhiannon and Olive high five each other. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nOlive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of guys. Rhiannon sits at a different table, mostly comprised of girls, and glares at her from across the room. \nThe bell rings and the students begin getting up and making their way toward the exit. \nAnson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways) approaches Olive. \nANSON Hey Olive. \nOlive smiles sweetly at him. \nANSON (CONT'D) I was wondering if you were busy tonight. Maybe wanna go out or something? \nOLIVE (SUSPICIOUS) What did you have in mind? \nANSON I dunno. I was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon, taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous reading of Emily Dickinson. \nOLIVE (COYLY) Why, Anson, are you inviting me to accompany you to a romantic dinner at the Red Lobster? \nANSON Unequivocally. \nOLIVE (IMPRESSED) Nice. Yeah. I'll have dinner with you. \nMEERKAT TODD You wanna talk about it? \nOLIVE What's to say? I'm a horrible person. Everyone thinks I'm a whore and, for the first time, I'm starting to believe it. \nMEERKAT TODD Huh? \nOLIVE Oh, don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me. \nMEERKAT TODD I know what people are saying. Doesn't mean I believe them. \nOLIVE Why not? \nMEERKAT TODD Olive, contrary to popular belief, I'm not an idiot. I know exactly what's going on and I know exactly what you're doing. \nShe stops crying. \nOLIVE Who told you? \nMEERKAT TODD No one had to tell me. All I know is once upon a time, there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasn't ready for his first kiss and there was this amazing little girl who lied for him. \nShe smiles through her tears. \nOLIVE You remember that? \nMEERKAT TODD Yeah and after I ran out, you pulled Brandon in. Yeah, I know about that, by the way. \nOLIVE And look how he turned out. \nMEERKAT TODD Sometimes I still pretend you were my first kiss. \nOLIVE (LAUGHING) Yeah? Who was? \nMEERKAT TODD Your friend. Rhiannon. \nOlive's laughter turns to rage. \nOLIVE What!? \nMEERKAT TODD Yeah. About a year later. It sucked. \nOLIVE (Blurting it out) She knew how I felt about you! \nMEERKAT TODD How do you feel about me? \nOLIVE (IGNORING HIM) She did it first! And here I am feeling SOOOO bad and THAT BITCH! \nMEERKAT TODD Wait. How do you feel about me? \nOLIVE (AGGRESSIVELY DEFENSIVE) Felt! I said FELT! \nMEERKAT TODD (DISAPPOINTED) Oh. \nHe stops the car. They're at her house. \nOLIVE (Off his look) I mean, it's not that I don't still feel that way. \nThere's an awkward moment between them. \nMEERKAT TODD Olive. If I promise not to tell anyone, could I kiss you? \nDespite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life, Olive looks down. \nOLIVE No. Not tonight. I don't want you to kiss me when mascara's running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half-hour ago. I've wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade, but I want it to be perfect. And right now, my life's a mess. I need to get it under control before I drag you into it. \nMEERKAT TODD What if I told you I wanted to be dragged into it? Maybe I could help. \nHe holds out his hand and she takes it. \nOLIVE Now I have a reason to fix this catastrophe I've brought upon myself. And I'm going to. \nMEERKAT TODD Okay. \nHe smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him. She hops out of the car and goes to her front door. \nMR. GRIFFIN What? \nThe gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she stumbles. \nOLIVE I -- I'm sorry. I -- \nNot knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOlive is mirthless, as she proceeds with her story. \nOLIVE Looking back, that's the thing I regret the most. That's the thing that sent me to the church, er, churches. And that's the thing that made me realize how profoundly I'd fucked up. (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) And that's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. With my words, even though they were true, I ended a marriage. No kid should have to be burdened with that. \nShe contemplates this. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nAs we saw before, Olive sits and plays `CONNECT FOUR' with Mr. Griffin, at his desk. Both are looking beaten down and very depressed and their minds are on everything but the game. \nMr. Griffin puts his hand on Olive's. \nMR. GRIFFIN It's not your fault. \nOlive gets a tear in her eyes. She puts a RED CHIP in at the top and loses the game. She reaches over and presses the lever, causing all of the chips to fall on his desk. \nCUT TO: \nTHE JENGA SET-UP \nThere's a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all fall down. \nCUT TO: \nHe rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box, full of his things. \nHe smiles and she hugs him -- intensely, tears quickly welling up in her eyes. \nOLIVE I'm so sorry. \nMR. GRIFFIN No. It's not your fault. \nThey just hold each other. Finally, Mr. Griffin pulls away and takes his things and starts to leave. But then he turns and says -- \nMR. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) I hope that you and Todd end up okay. \nOLIVE Me too. Where are you going? \nMR. GRIFFIN Not sure yet. Away from her. \nOLIVE Can I come? \nThey share one last, pained smile and he leaves. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nHearfelt, into the webcam -- \nOLIVE Mr. Griffin, if you ever see this, just know - I was wrong to tell you that. In that way. At all. I don't know. I shouldn't have done it. I don't feel bad for lying for your wife. But I hate myself for telling you the truth. I'm so sorry. \nShe wipes away a tear, pulls herself together. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Part Five: Not With a Whimper But With a Bang. \nEXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nAs we saw before -- \nThe Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like: \nEXPEL OLIVE! \nINT. GYM - DAY \nWe join a pep rally, already in progress. \nThe DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of Michael Jackson's `BAD.' \nIn the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina. \nMARIANNE So, Olive wasn't at school today. \nShe extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them. Marianne puts her arm around Rhi. \nMARIANNE (CONT'D) I'm so glad you're with us now. \nRHIANNON Me too. You guys fucking rock. \nMARIANNE We don't say that word, Rhiannon. \nNINA (HELPFULLY) Just say `effing' instead. We effing rock. \nMarianne nods in agreement, however Rhi is confused. \nRHIANNON But isn't that just implying the same word? \nMARIANNE Oh, Rhiannon. We have so much to teach you. It's okay to imply things. \nRhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at her. \nThe song ends and there's a drum roll. \nRHIANNON Yay! It's time for Meerkat Todd. (SEXUALLY) I just want to rip that costume off him and -- \nMarianne puts her hand firmly on Rhi's knee. \nMARIANNE Why don't you just not talk for a while, okay hon? \nRhi puts her head down. \nThe drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume. He jumps around enthusing the student body -- \nBut then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a DUMPSTER. \nThe familiar chords of the James Bond theme `Nobody Does It Better' plays from the band. \nMeerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS, with a BOA draped around her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and slightly different lyrics: \nOLIVE Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, I'm the best. \nTodd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off - and she's quite good. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I wasn't lookin,' But somehow they found me. I tried to hide from Your love light. But like heaven above me The guys who loved me Are keepin' all my secrets safe tonight. \nShe winks at the audience. The guys begin to wolf whistle and howl at her sheer brilliance. \nShe begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to reveal: \nBLUE DEVIL TODD! The crowd goes wild. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) And nobody does it better Though sometimes I wish someone could. Nobody does it quite the way I do. Why'd I have to be so good? \nShe saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving a big, red lip mark. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) The way that they hold me Whenever they hold me There's some kind of magic inside you. That keeps me from runnin', But just keep it comin'! How'd you learn to do the things you do? \nShe sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop her. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Oh, and nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, baby! Darlin', I'm the best! \nShe walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS, and runs her fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments. \nThe crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused. \n", "test1_input": "Clad in sunglasses, fuck-me-boots and looking like a bona fide porn star, Olive struts down the halls of her school. Sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is \nA FIERY RED `A' \n(NOTE: For the rest of the film, every piece of Olive's clothing will be emblazoned with a RED A.) \nErections are popping up all along the halls, as well as looks of total disbelief from the girls. \nShe works it like a Debbie Who Just Did Dallas, D\u00fcsseldorf, Des Moines, Daytona, Detroit and Darfur. \nUp ahead, Rhiannon is yakking with a semi-attractive guy named ANSON (17). She catches sight of Olive and her jaw drops. \nOlive sidles up to Anson, much to Rhiannon's chagrin. \nOLIVE Hey, Anson. \nANSON (NERVOUS) Hi. \nOLIVE (Breathy and aping Marilyn MONROE) I just realized the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for `I love...' \nANSON (STUTTERING) What's an anagram? \nOLIVE Look it up, big boy. \nShe rubs her knee, seductively, along his inner thigh, turns and licks her lips at a repulsed Rhiannon and continues on her way. \nINT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH LINE - LATER \nAnything sexually suggestive you can do with school cafeteria food, Olive does as she makes her way through the lunch line, as guys ogle her. \nMarianne, also present in the line, watches her in repugnance. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nOlive emerges from the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM, dressed for gym class. A TERRIFIED FAT KID named EVAN nervously approaches her. \nEVAN Hey Olive. \nOLIVE Hi Evan. \nEVAN Can I talk to you for a second? \nHe gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers. She reluctantly does so. \nEVAN (CONT'D) (WHISPERING) Don't get mad, but Brandon told me what you did for him. \nOLIVE Well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me. \nEVAN No, he told me the truth. \nShe's pissed. She silently seethes. \nEVAN (CONT'D) And I was just hoping that maybe you could do the same for me? \nOLIVE (Through clenched teeth) Walk away, Evan. \nEvan starts to talk, but she raises her hand to silence him. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) RUN away, Evan. \nEVAN I can pay you, too. \nOLIVE I'm about six seconds away from slapping you so hard that your unborn grandchildren will feel it. \nEVAN (Excited at the prospect) Can you do it in front of everyone? \nOlive turns and starts to leave. Evan summons up his courage and meekly states to her back. \nEVAN (CONT'D) I don't need your permission, you know. \nShe turns around and gives him a look of death. He can't look at her. \nEVAN (CONT'D) I mean, at the rate you're going, I'm just saying I don't think anyone would not believe it. \n", "test1_true": "EVAN I'll give you $500. \nOLIVE You're repugnant. \nEVAN (Indicating his body) That's the problem. \nAnd once again Olive feels too sorry for him to say no. \nOLIVE I want five hundred dollars in gift certificate form deposited in my locker before noon tomorrow. Preferably `The Gap,' but I'll also take Amazon.com. We did NOT have sex. I was piss-ass drunk and I let you fondle my chest and it was a glorious moment for you, unmatched by anything you've heretofore experienced, including cake. Got it? \nEVAN Five hundred bucks for just feeling you up? Doesn't that seem a little steep to you? Can you throw in SOME (Mispronouncing it; as if it rhymed with `cottage') frottage? \nOLIVE (CORRECTING HIM) It's fraw-TAHZH, dumbass. (BUCKLING) Fine. But it was so good, you lasted only twelve seconds and I better not find out that little pecker of yours EVER came out of your pants. Take it or leave it. \nEVAN Little pecker? Nuh-uh. For five hundred dollars, it was ungodly huge. You even commented on the unusual girth for a guy my age. \nOLIVE I was too drunk to remember. \nEVAN Three minutes. \nOLIVE Two. \nHe extends his hand. \nEVAN Deal. \nShe, repulsed by it, shakes his hand. Evan's ecstatic. \nOLIVE The sad thing is, Evan, if you had been a gentleman and asked me out on a date, I probably would have said yes. \nEVAN Really? Do you want to go on a date? \nWith zero vitriol -- \nOLIVE Not now, I don't. \nSad for him, she walks away. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nInto the webcam -- \nOLIVE Evan, if you're watching this - shame on you. I hope you never treat another girl the way you treated me or you will die alone, wishing it was because you're fat. And since we're playing the shame game... While I appreciate the sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand job should have warranted a little more than a hundred dollars worth of AMC Movie Passes. They had an expiration date AND were only able to be used for movies that had been running for two weeks. But even that's better than Tyler Jennings, who gave me a ten percent off coupon to Bath and Body Works. Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is that how good my imaginary blow job was to you? Huh? Is chivalry dead? I want John Cusack holding a boombox outside my window. I want Richard Gere climbing up my fire escape with the limo waiting downstairs. I want to ride off on a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey. Although, I'm ashamed to admit I'd prefer him to look like he looks now. What woman wouldn't? But no. I get to save two fifty on a bottle of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion. Maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's in a coma and the prognosis isn't good. (Beat.) So, if you're still with me - and I'm guessing that most of you are - I now present to you Part Four: How I, Olive Penderghast, Went From Assumed Trollop To an Actual Home- wrecker. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nMr. Griffin is alone grading papers. Olive pokes her head in. \nOLIVE You wanted to see me? \nMR. GRIFFIN Yeah, Olive. Come cop a squat. \nShe takes a seat opposite his desk. He points to the RED \"A\" on her chest. \nMR. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nOLIVE Accessorizing? \nMR. GRIFFIN Olive, Olive, Olive. Do you think that maybe you're reading a little too much into this assignment? \nOLIVE Well, I'm really hoping to get an A. (She points to her chest) Get it? Get it? \nMR. GRIFFIN I'm hearing things. \nShe takes a deep breath. \nOLIVE The rumors are true. I am, in fact, considering becoming an existentialist. \nMR. GRIFFIN You know what I'm talking about. \nOLIVE Geez, since when did teachers become privy to idle, adolescent gossip? \nMR. GRIFFIN I guess it wouldn't matter so much if I didn't like you. You're a great girl and I happen to think that all of (MORE) \n", "test1_id": 1395, "test2_input": "OLIVE (V.O.) So, I guess I shouldn't be too shocked that these people wanted my diseased, home-wrecking ass out of there. \nThe scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOlive laughs. \nOLIVE The funny thing is: the whole time this shit was going down - people calling me something I knew wasn't true, my best friend included - I couldn't help but think how I could have come up with better signs. No one even bothered to use alliteration or, God forbid, irony - not even a single acronym - and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins. \nINT. CATHEDRAL - DAY \nOlive enters a Catholic Church. It's empty, but there are a few CANDLES burning. She sees the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH and makes a beeline toward it. \nShe takes a deep breath and enters. \nINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS \nShe sits down and begins to talk to the screen. \nOLIVE Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. I think that's how you're supposed to start these things. I'm only going on what I've seen in the movies. Then, I think I'm supposed to tell you how long it's been since my last confession, but that's kind of my first confession. I'm not Catholic. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do, except sit here in this booth and tell you what I've done wrong. Where do I even start? (Beat.) I've been pretending to be a -- how would one phrase it in Catholic words? A harlot. It's not like I've actually been doing the things that people are saying I'm doing, but - then again - I'm not denying them, so I've just been wondering: is that wrong? There's a lot of shi -- `crap' going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this masquerade. (Beat.) I'm lying. I may have caused the end of a marriage. I thought, in my own perverse way, that I could help it. I mean, in my defense, I am merely an adolescent. I should never have been propositioned in the way I was propositioned by an adult. But then again, I should never have consented. It was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and I thought it was okay, because it wasn't real. (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) It was make-believe and no one was getting hurt. But a lot of people hate me now. I kind of hate me, too. \nThere's a long silence. Olive tears up and wipes them away. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) I could be wrong, but aren't you supposed to say something or ask me questions. Tell me to say `Hail Marys'? Hello? \nShe looks through the screen. There's no one there. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Oh, come on! \nShe throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out. \nEXT. CATHEDRAL PARKING LOT - DAY \nOlive, upset at herself, gets into her car and drives off. But just a few blocks down the street to -- \nEXT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nShe parks her car and gets out to try a different denomination. \nINT. CHURCH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nOlive enters to find a SWEET, PORTLY RECEPTIONIST (50's) searching through RELIGIOUS CLIP-ART on her COMPUTER, attempting to find the perfect image for the church newsletter. \nThe lady smiles, acknowledging Olive. \nOLIVE Hi. I was wondering if the minister was around. \nRECEPTIONIST Pastor McGreevey is on vacation this week. But our associate pastor is in. Would you like to speak to him? \nFor her own entertainment, Olive matches the receptionist's enthusiasm level. \nOLIVE Actually, that would be fantastic! \nRECEPTIONIST Can I tell him what this is regarding? \nOLIVE Absolutely. I'm looking for a church to join and I thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment. \nThe receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone. \nRECEPTIONIST Don, there's a young lady here who would like to speak with you about joining. \nShe listens and then hangs up. \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (Pointing to an office) You can go right in. \nOLIVE If everyone here is as friendly as you, I think we might be in business. \nShe winks at the receptionist and enters -- \nINT. ASSOCIATE PASTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \n", "test2_true": "ASSOCIATE PASTOR DON Hello there, young lady. My name is Don. \nHe extends his hand, which she shakes politely. \nASSOCIATE PASTOR DON (CONT'D) How can I help you today? \nOLIVE I'm new to the area. Looking for a church - hopefully something with a strong fellowship, a firm foot in the soil of... (MORE) \nOLIVE (CONT'D) divinity and was wondering what your church's stance on lying and adultery was? \nDon seems taken aback by the question. \nASSOCIATE PASTOR DON Well. It's not a good thing. \nOLIVE Oh, I agree. Wholeheartedly. But tell me: assuming there is a hell -- \nASSOCIATE PASTOR DON Ma'am, the Presbyterian Church recognizes the existence of hell. \nOLIVE Right. Okay. Let's say hell exists. Which is worse - lying or adultery? Or is lying about adultery like a double whammy? \nASSOCIATE PASTOR DON I'm sorry, ma'am, I -- What did you say your name was? \nAt that moment, Olive looks at his desk and sees a FRAMED FAMILY PHOTO. Smiling big are Associate Pastor Don, his wife, A WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA and his lovely DAUGHTER -- \nMARIANNE BRYANT. \nShe jumps up from her chair and recoils at the sight of the picture and the stupid mistake she made by coming there. \nOLIVE You know what. I think I'm just going to go and check out Judaism. \nBacking up toward the door. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) The Jews and I have a lot in common. Fashion-wise. And stuff. So, thank you for your time. \nShe bolts from his office. \nINT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY \nOlive speaks into her webcam -- \nOLIVE Yes. I had unwittingly sought advice from the father of the leader of my lynch mob. Who else can say that's happened to them? (Beat.) As much as I want to say I hate Marianne. I don't. I get her. Well, I get certain things about her. She's passionate. Like myself. She always thinks she's right. Like myself. And, yeah, I can kind of understand why she slapped me that day. Here's what happened... \nINT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY \nMarianne, excitedly, runs over to Olive who is just getting to school and throws her arms around her. \nOLIVE (V.O.) Remember how I said that we were BFFs for, like, a day. Well, that's true. It was like we were sisters all of a sudden. \nMarianne can't seem to break the embrace and Olive just goes with it. \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nOlive sits in class. Marianne passes a note back to her. \nOLIVE (V.O.) She wrote me a note in first period. \nOlive reads it. It says: Hey girlie! You wanna hang out after school today? Kisses! Marianne \nMarianne looks back and Olive gives her the thumbs up. \nAcross the room, Rhi sees this exchange and sneers. \nINT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER \nMarianne is working with her partner, Evan. She turns to Olive behind them and makes a gagging signal behind his back and laughs silently. \nOLIVE (V.O.) By second period, it was like we had private jokes. \nOlive, unaware of how to respond, gives another thumbs up. \nINT. HOME EC CLASSROOM - LATER \nOlive sees Marianne come into class, tear-streaked. She runs over to Olive and again throws her arms around her. \n", "test2_id": 1396, "test3_input": "OLIVE Rhiannon's over there. \nANSON So? \nOLIVE So? She's been in love with you since the first grade. \nANSON So? \nOLIVE Well, she's my best friend. \nANSON I thought you two weren't speaking. \nOLIVE We're not, but it doesn't mean I should be out with you. \nANSON Then why are you? \nOLIVE I don't know. You asked me out? \nANSON Exactly. I have no interest in her. I mean, we're friends, but -- \nOLIVE She can't see us. \nANSON (DISAPPOINTED) Do you want me to get the check? \nOLIVE (TOUCHED) Would you mind? \nHe gestures for the server who appears. \nANSON Could we get our check? \nSERVER (CONFUSED) Is everything okay? \nOLIVE I just remembered I'm allergic to shellfish. I always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and I'd die. It sucks I know. \nEven more confused, the server obliges and gives them their check. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) (Digging in her purse) Let me get it. I have a gift certificate. \nShe pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves. \nANSON But I asked you out. \nOLIVE And I ruined it, so let me bear the financial brunt. (Beat.) I'm so sorry about this. But she really likes you. \nANSON She and I just don't have much in common. \nOLIVE And you and I do? \nANSON I think so. For instance, I, too think Nina Howell's a twat. \nOLIVE Yeah, well, if that's our magical connection, I should date the entire school. \nANSON Haven't you? \nOlive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit pissed. \nANSON (CONT'D) Kidding! \nOLIVE Yeah, about that -- \nThe server reappears with the check. \nSERVER You have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six cents. \nOLIVE Keep it. Tip. \nThe sever smiles and leaves them again. \nANSON Let's get out of here. \nThey duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if Rhiannon sees them. \nShe does. \n", "test3_true": "The Abernathys see her, as well, and wave. It's painfully obvious to Olive that Rhi hasn't told her parents about their differences. She starts to go over, but Rhiannon's face is turning vermillion in anger. Olive just waves, sheepishly and leaves with Anson. \nI/E. ANSON'S CAR - RED LOBSTER PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nOlive's face is painted with guilt. She feels like shit, but doesn't want to externalize it. \nAnson puts his hand on her knee. \nANSON I have something for you. \nOlive manages a smile. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $500 GIFT CERTIFICATE to ANTHROPOLOGIE and hands it to her. \nOlive is disappointed, but tries not to show it. \nOLIVE Oh. I didn't realize -- \nSnapping out of her guilt. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Okay. So, what did we \"do\" on this date? \nANSON Whatever $500 gets me. \nHe leans over and kisses her. She pushes him off. \nOLIVE Wait. This isn't how it works. I don't actually -- \nBut he's kissing her again, a little too forcibly. She pushes him off again. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) You don't get it. I'm not technically having sex with people for money. You know that, right? Besides, even if I was, we're in the parking lot of a Red Lobster. \nANSON We can go wherever you want, but I think it would be kind of hot here. \nHe takes off his shirt. \nOLIVE Dude, I gotta go. It's been -- sad. \nShe gets out of the car. He rolls down the window. \nANSON Olive, you're being stupid. I'll take you home. \nOLIVE No thanks. \nHe drives off, leaving her outside in the parking lot. \nOLIVE (CONT'D) Fuck. \nAs luck would have it, Meerkat Todd, is coming out the back exit. He sees her and gives her a surprised, toothy grin. \nMEERKAT TODD Hey Olive! \nOLIVE Hey Todd. \nMEERKAT TODD What are you doing here? \nOLIVE Oh, I'm just hanging out in the parking lot. I do that sometimes. Not necessarily just here. The one outside of Applebee's is fun, too. \nMEERKAT TODD (Laughing at her oddness) You want a ride somewhere? \nOLIVE Nah. I'm fine. \nMEERKAT TODD Your friend Rhi is inside. It's her Mom's birthday. \nTears begin to glisten in Olive's eyes. \nOLIVE She's not my friend anymore. \nTodd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to his car. He opens the door for her and she sits down. \nI/E. MEERKAT TODD'S CAR - NIGHT \nOlive is trying to pull herself together but she can't stop crying as Todd drives her home. \nTodd doesn't know what to say to her. Finally -- \n", "test3_id": 1397}

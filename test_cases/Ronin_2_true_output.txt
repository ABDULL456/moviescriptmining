LARRY (still having trouble believing it) We've been crossed... 
The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive, charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car, and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET 
The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old City a coppery red. 
We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and turns of what an American would call back alleys but that pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted, then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried. Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear - 
LARRY (V.O.) What is this? 
INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME 
A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to Larry's wound.  Sam seems to know what he's doing, as Larry is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make- shift stand. 
SAM (answering Larry's question) It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. 
LARRY Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. (a quick beat) I don't mean that in, like, a literal way... 
DEIRDRE Of course. 
VINCENT Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is. (he looks at Deirdre, and suddenly he's deadly earnest) What did we steal? 
DEIRDRE (suddenly defensive) I don't know. 
VINCENT When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on. 
DEIRDRE Well I don't! 
VINCENT And I don't believe you... 
Vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at Deirdre's head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as well, jammed into his stomach. 
DEIRDRE (suddenly feral) You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground. 
VINCENT (matching her intensity) I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth! 
SAM (O.S.) (with a dead cool in his voice) Both of you... 
ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun - an interesting moment, because he can shoot either Deirdre or Vincent, but not both at the same time.  The question is: whose side is he on? 
SAM (continuing without missing a beat) ...put your guns down and chill out. 
A BEAT.  And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons, followed by Sam. 
SAM Like it or now, we're on the same side: we're here and the package isn't. (looks at Deirdre) You're not the boss any more, you're our partner.  So tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this mess. 
Sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust based upon their physical intimacy. 
SAM Now, what did we steal? 
DEIRDRE (she hates to admit this) I don't know... (defensively, off Vincent's look) Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. (quick beat, then reluctantly continuing) But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob. 
LARRY Your people?  Who the fuck is your people? 
VINCENT Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA. 
DEIRDRE And you believed me? (passionately) But it wasn't my people who did it. 
LARRY How do we know that? 
SAM Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us. 
DEIRDRE Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...

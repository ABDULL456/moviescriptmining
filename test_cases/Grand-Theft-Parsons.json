{"train": "Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit. A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard. \nDOCTOR Can I help you? \nPHIL Naw, I'm cool thanks. \nThe doctor reads the tag on the body's toe. \nDOCTOR What are you doing? \nPHIL Just taking some stiff down to neurology. \nCON TINUE D: \nDOCTOR We don't have a neurology department. \nPHIL Urology. \nThe doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Okay. Just hold your horses - I'll go check the paperwork. \nThe doctor holds up his clipboard. DOCTOR I have the paperwork. \nPHIL No. You have your paperwork. I need to go check my paperwork. \nHe slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door. \nDOCTOR Hello?   Hello... \nHe glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in sight. \nEXT. DESERT. MORNING Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road. \nNB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through the desert, set to music. \nEXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY \nThe Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket. \nINT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY \nPhil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes. \nSUSIE Guess who? \nPHIL Martin Luther King. \nSUSIE Try again... Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull away with little success. \nPHIL This.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...Baby.... \nSusie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately. \nINT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY \nPhil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table.   He takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back. SUSIE God damn!     I'm so sorry, baby. \nPHIL Yeah, out of a job again. \nSUSIE Would never have happened if you were there. \nPHIL How do you know I wasn't? \nSUSIE Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die. \nPHIL I was still 'on staff'. He was still my responsibility. \nCON TINUE D: \nThey sit quietly for a moment.      Then: \nPHIL (CONT'D) So where have you been, anyway? \nShe sighs, and stands up. \nPHIL (CONT'D) How long this time? Two weeks? \nSUSIE Your job is to arrange other people's lives. Maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own. \nSusie walks out of the room. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET. DAY \nA suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down the street, past house and identical house, until we rest outside another that is identical to the rest. The front door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New Orleans Taxi' marked on the door. \nMAN Airport, please. \nThis is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father. \nINT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY \nThere is a loud banging on the front door. Phil glances out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. He opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step. \nPHIL Long time, no see, Barbara. \nCON TINUE D: \nBARBARA Don't try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you repellent slimeball. \nShe notices Susie standing behind Phil. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) The latest victim? \nBarbara walks past them into the kitchen.      Susie looks quizzically at Phil. \nPHIL Meet Barbara. \nBarbara calls out from the kitchen. BARBARA It's a lot tidier than I remember. \nSusie raises an eyebrow at Phil. \nSUSIE Who the hell is she? \nPHIL Gram's ex-girlfriend. \nPhil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts. \nSUSIE Girlfriend? Isn't he married? \nBarbara walks back into the hall. BARBARA Welcome to the seventies. \nPHIL What do you want, Barbara? \nBarbara lights a cigarette. \nBARBARA I'm here to fulfill Gram's wishes. \nShe waits for him to speak. \nPHIL That's nice. I have no idea what you're talking about. \nShe holds up an old piece of writing paper. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nBARBARA Do you know what this is? \nPhil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) It's Gram's will. \nShe reads it out. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) To whom it may concern: I would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave Barbara Mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my death. Signed: Ingram Cecil Parsons. \nPhil looks surprised. \nPHIL Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how? \nBarbara gives a wry smile. \nBARBARA Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny. \nPHIL That's not a will Barbara, and you know it. BARBARA It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar. \nUNDERTAKER (CONT'D) Yeah, he was here. \nMutter. \nUNDERTAKER (CONT'D) New Orleans. Although he only just went, so he'll still be on his way to Los Angeles Airport. Big thrill for us here, as we're only a small facility. Nearly got Jane Mansfield in '67 when she passed through, but she got diverted to Frisco. Hello? \nNo mutter. \nUNDERTAKER (CONT'D) Hello.    Hellooo... \nINT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY \nThe phone sits on the table but the room is empty. \nSUSIE (O.S) Phil? \nSusie walks in, looks around, and leaves. \nEXT. PHIL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon, his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she watches him. After a minute: \nSUSIE What are you doing? \nPHIL These things aren't that big. \nSUSIE Okay.    Is that a problem? \nPHIL Not really. \nSusie is confused. \nCON TINUE D: \nSUSIE Well, that's good. \nNo answer.      Phil continues to check out the inside of her car. \nSUSIE (CONT'D) So what are you up to? \nPHIL It's best you don't know. \nWithout a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house. Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door. Phil gets out of the back. SUSIE I don't know what this madness is, but I'm not getting involved. \nPHIL Well, that's the point. \nSUSIE I mean, I don't know what it is you're planning, but I'm not bailing you out again. \nPHIL Right. \nSUSIE I'm going. PHIL Again. \nShe gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move. After a moment the window winds down. \nSUSIE This time, I'm not coming back. \nShe gives him a 'so there' smile. \nSUSIE (CONT'D) I'm going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk. \nShe drives away. \nEXT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY \nPhil arrives on his trike outside a small house. \nINT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY \nA man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background. This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room. \nPHIL (O.S) Hello? Anyone there? Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back. \nPHIL (CONT'D) (O.S) There you are. I'm looking for Larry Osterberg. \nLarry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door, which he opens. \nLARRY The door is unlocked. \nPhil barrels in and closes the door behind him.   He turns to take a look around the room. PHIL You Larry Osterberg? \nLARRY Meet Bernice. \nPHIL Bernice? \nLARRY Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute. You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds. \nThere is a very long silence. \nPHIL It's yellow. \nLARRY Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes in yellow. \nPHIL It's supposed to be black. \nLARRY But they're all black. \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL That might be my point. \nLARRY So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse? \nPHIL I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse. \nLARRY (patiently) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black. \nThey stare at each other for a moment.       Then Phil sighs deeply. \nPHIL Okay.   Where are the keys? \nLARRY Why? \nPHIL I gotta go. Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again. \nLARRY Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere without me. \nPhil thinks this over. \nPHIL Okay.   Well, let's boogie. \nLarry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nLarry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches. \nCON TINUE D: Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the steering lock. Phil watches curiously. \nLARRY Someone stole her last summer. \nPHIL Well, I've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see I'm getting the best... \nLARRY How did you hear of Bernice and me? \nPHIL You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area. \nLarry looks pleased. \nPHIL (CONT'D) But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don't go getting carried away... \nEXT. LA HIGHWAY. DAY \nOne backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud of exhaust smoke. \nINT. BARBARA'S HOME. EVENING \nBarbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the will. She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair. EXT. LAX. EVENING \nThe hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING \nPhil glances out of the window. \nPHIL Pull over. \nLarry parks, and Phil looks at his watch. \nBARBARA Why, thank you... \nINT. AIRPORT CHECK IN DESK - LAX. MORNING \nStanley is standing at the Airport Airlines check-in desk, facing the check-in clerk. \nSTANLEY Parsons. \nThe clerk checks her paperwork. \nCHECK-IN CLERK You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons? \nSTANLEY Yes. \nCHECK-IN CLERK And you're flying directly back to New Orleans? On the same plane? \nSTANLEY That is correct. \nThe clerk awaits an explanation, but none is forthcoming. She raises an eyebrow. \nCHECK-IN CLERK Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at Los Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons. \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY Thank you. \nStanley turns to go, but then pauses. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) I've come to pick up my son's body. \nThe line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk wobbles slightly. Stanley raises his voice. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) My son died out here, you see? So I've come to bring him home. Everyone looks at Stanley.            Stanley looks at the clerk. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) I'm wondering if that's enough information for you? \nCHECK-IN CLERK Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll... see to it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir. \nSTANLEY Most kind. \nINT. BANK. MORNING \nThere is a line leading to the information desk, but Barbara ignores it. She walks up to a female teller, who is serving another customer, and cuts in. BARBARA I'd like to see the manager, please. \nCUSTOMER Wait your turn. \nBarbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip trembles. \nBARBARA I'm sorry. It's just that the man I loved died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners... \nShe dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief.           The customer looks embarrassed. \nCUSTOMER I'm sorry.     Please... go ahead. \nCON TINUE D: \nBarbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look.   The teller responds with a similar look. \nBARBARA The manager? \nEXT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nA man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches, before getting out of the car. \nEXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary. \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar. \nCLERK Can I help you? \nPHIL I'm here to pick up a... coffin. \nPhil is under pressure. \nPHIL Joshua Tree, yeah. \nA buzzer sounds.         No-one moves. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the city. \nCLERK Never heard of that. \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL It's small. Just another local community struggling to get by. \nThe buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the subject. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Use your phone? \nAfter a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of the mortuary. Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks up the phone and dials. \nINT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. MORNING Susie is packing. The phone rings and she hesitates for a moment. Then she continues loading her case, leaving the phone unanswered. \nINT. CHECK IN DESK. DAY \nStanley tries to ask a question at the check in desk, but gives up and walks toward an exit. \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside. \nCLERK (into casket) Hello there. We was looking for you. \nHe wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look inside. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Need you to sign for it again. \nPhil signs the papers. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Looks like it's your lucky day after all. \nPHIL Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy. \nPhil again glances out of the window. \nEXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe cop is wandering around the hearse.    Larry trails behind him, disconsolately. \nCOP I don't like the look of you. \nLARRY (miserably) No. Fair enough. \nCOP Wherever there's a hippie there's a crime, even if it hasn't happened yet. That's what I always say. \nLARRY Right.   Good saying. \nHe prods at the broken light with his baton. \nCOP So whatcha doing here? \nLARRY We're meeting someone off a flight. \nCOP You're meeting someone off a flight? \nLARRY Yes. \nCOP In a hearse? \nLARRY Yes.   It's a... surprise. \nCOP Which parts the surprise: The fact that you're in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you're dressed like something out of a horror film, or the fact that you're half a mile from the terminal and they're gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you? \nLarry is looking increasingly desperate. \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY Well... the first part. \nPHIL Yes!    We did it!! \nLARRY Did what?    What did we do? \nPhil changes the subject. \nPHIL What was all that babbling about earlier? \nLARRY I didn't babble. I just... have a problem with authority. \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL What the hell does that mean? \nLARRY I don't like them and I don't know what to say to them. They make me feel uneasy. \nPHIL Well of course they make you feel uneasy. They're supposed to make you feel uneasy. \nLarry sulks. Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall. EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nWe pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has missed. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nThey both sit there, staring out of the windshield at the wall. \nPHIL You hit the wall. \nLARRY I clipped it. I clipped the wall. \nPHIL (shouts) There's a gap fifty yards wide! You just had to aim for the gap. How could you miss the gap? \nLARRY (babbles) I was distracted. We're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I'd only just woken up and... \nThe cop peers in at the window and gestures at Phil to wind it down. As he does, the glass falls out. \nPHIL Hello, officer. I guess they make these hearses wider than they need to... \nThe cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry. \nCON TINUE D: \nCOP Are you on drugs, boy? \nLarry swallows hard. \nLARRY Uh, not at this time, no sir. \nCOP Not at this time. Okay, well let's see. You just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight. Why was that? \nLarry licks his lips. LARRY Well... \nPause.   Phil wills him to speak. \nPHIL Well... \nStill nothing. Larry looks like he's trying to form words, but nothing emerges. \nCOP Now I'm gonna... \nThe radio in his car crackles into life. We - and he - are too far away to hear what is said. He is torn for a moment, but then: \nCOP (CONT'D) Wait. \nHe walks back to his car.           Phil shakes his head. \nPHIL Fantastic.     Well done. \nLARRY Oh, right.     So it's all my fault? \nPHIL You... you just drove into a wall! Of course it's your fault. Jesus! \nThey both stare out of the window at the cop, who is talking animatedly into his radio. Then the flashing lights and siren go on. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Here it comes... \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nLarry turns to look at his reflection in the grimy mirror. He is shaking. \nEXT. GAS STATION FORECOURT. DAY \nThe tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back on. Phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can. He passes it to the guy. \nPHIL High test. \nATTENDANT This car runs on regular. \nPhil raises an eyebrow, glances across at the casket, and winks. PHIL Who says it's for the car? \nThe man gapes at him. Larry walks over to the car and Phil gets into the passenger seat. He passes some money to the attendant and takes the can. \nATTENDANT Ain't fer the car? \nPHIL Nope. \nLarry jiggles the screwdriver, slips Bernice into gear, and they're gone. The attendant watches them go. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nLarry is driving, Phil is looking out of the window.   They are still in a built up area with cars around them. \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY We could go back. \nPHIL Why would we want to do that? \nLARRY I wasn't expecting a long trip. I haven't packed any spare clothes. We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow. \nPHIL You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes? LARRY Well, yes. \nPhil stares at him. \nPHIL And then drive back out tomorrow? \nLARRY We could do that. \nPHIL Just drive the car, okay? \nLARRY We could just... \nPHIL No. LARRY It would... \nPHIL No. \nLARRY I... \nPHIL No. \nINT. BARBARA'S HOME. DAY \nBarbara is standing in her sitting room, the phone to her ear. \nBARBARA You might need to repeat that. \nCON TINUE D: \nHer mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Stolen? What the hell do you mean, stolen? Who steals a body? \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nPhil is smoking. Larry is driving, his fingers tapping nervously on the wheel. He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence. \nLARRY I still don't fully understand what you do. PHIL Well, I do everything. \nLARRY Everything? \nPHIL This little number is for drinking money. By trade I'm a Road Manager. \nLARRY Oh, one of those.   Like a well- paid gopher. \nPHIL No, not like a well-paid gopher. I'm responsible for movement, maintenance and management. I'm a confidante and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador. I'm like an executive nanny. Not a gopher. \nBARBARA Fine. \nShe walks across the room and picks up the phone. \nEXT. MELON STALL. DAY \nPhil is holding the phone. \nPHIL Hello baby, it's the love machine. How are ya? \nINT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY \nBarbara smiles unpleasantly. BARBARA Hello Kaufman. I know what you're up to, you thieving bastard. I know where you're going, and I know about your sick, revolting plans, and I'm coming after you. And when I catch you... \nEXT. MELON STALL. DAY \nPhil looks surprised. \nPHIL Hello Barbara. How nice to hear from you again. And so soon... \nSuddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Sorry Barb, gotta go. \nHe goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last comment. \nPHIL (CONT'D) It's been real, though. \nHe puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns. \nINT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY \nBarbara slams the phone down. Then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table. \nBARBARA Sonofabitch! \nShe walks to the door, brushing past Susie.   Then she stops. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Okay, honey. Do you want to see who Phil Kaufman really is? Do you want to see what he's capable of? Barbara shows Susie the door. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Or maybe you already know I'm right. \nSusie hesitantly dismisses the challenge. \nSUSIE You don't know shit about him. \nBARBARA Well why don't we find out? \nBarbara turns and walks out.    Susie looks at her packed bags then follows. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY Phil gets into the hearse, looks back at the coffin and sniffs. He looks down at the air conditioning and turns it up full. Larry starts the engine and the car stalls. \nPHIL So what's that about? \nLARRY Sunstroke. \nPhil shakes his head. \nPHIL You've hardly left the car since we met. How can you have sunstroke? \nLARRY I'm susceptible. \nCON TINUE D: \nPhil doesn't look convinced. \nPHIL You're a winner, that's what you are. A winner... \nEventually, the engine catches. Phil immediately gestures at a small road that heads off into the desert. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Turn off here. \nLARRY This isn't the way to Palm Springs. Phil winks at him. \nPHIL It is if you're a coffin smuggler. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. DAY \nCON TINUE D: \nThere is a faint noise. Larry hears it first and then Phil and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify it and... it's a motorcycle cop. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I don't believe it. Middle of nowhere, and... quick - stand in front of the car! \nEXT. HIGHWAY. DAY \nThey jump out of the car and shuffle sideways, until they are standing in front of the actual point of collision. LARRY What now? \nPHIL Pretend we're having a conversation. \nThe buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner. \nLARRY Okay.   What about? \nPHIL I don't know what about! Ever since I met you, you've talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say. \nThe cop slows down but drives past.        Phil waves at him. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Whatever your damn fool religion is called, I think it works. \nLARRY Well... it's more a philosophy than a religion. \nThe cop does a U-turn and motors towards them. \nPHIL Oh, well done. Good work. \nHe shoots a vicious look at Larry.      The cop parks his bike and removes his helmet. \nCON TINUE D: As he opens his mouth to speak, a headlight falls off the car and rolls off the road. They all watch it go. \nMOTORCYCLE COP Afternoon. \nPHIL Afternoon, officer.    How's it going today? \nThe sign gives an ominous creak.         Larry takes a sideways step, out of danger. \nMOTORCYCLE COP Oh, it's going fine, thank you. How are things with you? PHIL Fine, fine. We just... stopped to take a look at... \nHe waves his arm at the desert. \nPHIL (CONT'D) ...the fine view you folks have got around here. \nThe cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around, as if it's the first time he's seen it. \nMOTORCYCLE COP Well, it is mighty nice around these parts. If you like desert. \nThey all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop glances down at the keys in Larry's hand. MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D) (to Larry) And how are things with you today, sir? \nLarry looks flustered. \nLARRY Ooooh, I'm well. Really well, actually. Thank you. \nThe cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a pleasant half-smile on his face. \nMOTORCYCLE COP The reason I ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nLarry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for the first time. \nLARRY Oh. \nMOTORCYCLE COP I'm surprised that you hadn't noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress. \nPhil starts to laugh. \nPHIL That's a great line... The cop turns to Phil.        He is still smiling. \nMOTORCYCLE COP Thank you. \nA long pause.      Then: \nMOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D) I wonder if you gentlemen can help me? \nPHIL Anything. \nPHIL Yes, I think we should go. \nLarry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes. \nLARRY Oh shit. \nPHIL Nicely done. \nHe rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle. \nPHIL (CONT'D) We'll be moving on, now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress. \nBernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike. The cop chases them. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nPhil screams at Larry. \nPHIL What the hell are you doing? \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY The steering lock is on. \nPHIL Well...   turn it off! \nLARRY I can't - he's got the keys. \nPhil turns to watch the chasing policeman. \nPHIL So, we've escaped but we can only drive in a circle? \nLARRY Yes. \nEXT. DESERT. DAY \nThey do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops, breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the hearse turns and heads back towards him. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nPhil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The hearse's direction immediately changes. \nPHIL Can we please go? LARRY Okay. \nEXT. DESERT. DAY \nThe hearse roars away and the cop watches it go. \nINT. BARBARA'S CAR. DAY \nBarbara drives and Susie sits in the passenger seat.   It doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours. \nSUSIE If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing him across California? \nBARBARA He's got Gram and I need him. \nCON TINUE D: \nSUSIE Well, that's really touching. But... you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's dead. \nBarbara shoots her a withering look. \nBARBARA I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death. \nSUSIE I don't understand. BARBARA Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay? \nSUSIE This is all about money, isn't it? \nBARBARA Isn't everything? \nSUSIE Why do you think you deserve anything? \nBARBARA I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party. \nSUSIE Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram. \nBARBARA What do you know? \nINT. KITCHEN - THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nWe are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries. He slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the food arrives. \nPHIL You frighten him. \nLARRY I do not. \nPHIL Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover. \nThey both look at Larry's bread and lettuce. \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL (CONT'D) It's probably the rabbit food. \nLARRY Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay? \nPHIL I understand. Really I do. That stuff'll mess you right up every time. \nPhil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go. \nINT. STANLEY'S CAR. DAY. Stanley is driving along the road. He puts his hand in his pocket, takes out his hip flask, pops the lid and goes to take a drink. It's empty. Then he notices the dinosaur. \nINT. THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nPhil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer. He gets up. Larry notices he hasn't eaten anything. \nLARRY I thought you were hungry. \nPhil ignores him. \nPHIL Gotta make a call. \nHe glances around and then walks over to the bar. PHIL (CONT'D) Hey man, where's the phone? \nBARMAN Out back. \nHe jerks his head by way of direction. Phil wanders off just as the door opens and Stanley walks in. \nSTANLEY Good afternoon. \nBARMAN Yup. \nSTANLEY Do you have a telephone I might use? \nBARMAN In a minute, I do. \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY In a minute? \nBARMAN Yeah.    Phone's for customers. \nStanley looks confused.           Then he understands. \nSTANLEY I'd better order, then. \nBARMAN Right. \nStanley picks up a menu. INT. 'OUT BACK' - THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nPhil dials a number on the phone. \nINT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY \nThe sitting room is empty.          The phone rings.     And rings. \nINT. 'OUT BACK' - THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nWhen it becomes clear that no one is going to answer, Phil replaces the receiver and walks back into the diner. He pushes past Stanley as he goes to the bar. \nINT. THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nPhil joins Larry and puts a bag of beers on the table. \nLARRY Speak to her? \nPhil propels Larry outside. \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons dead? \nPHIL Better get going. \nLARRY He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people... \nPHIL Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth. In fact, I thought he was never gonna stop talking. Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule. \nLARRY Schedule? What schedule?   There is no schedule... \nPHIL Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you? Get our package to Palm Springs. Remember? \nLarry looks horrified. \nLARRY Package?   We've stolen that man's son. \nPHIL Stolen... his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing. \nThey move round the back of the Polyonax Place, where Bernice is hidden behind an outhouse. \nLARRY I don't know what you take me for. I want to see in that box. \nLarry walks round to the back of the car. \nPHIL We've really got to go. \nLarry swings open the back window and pulls at the casket. \nLARRY It's heavy. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nPhil glances at his watch. \nPHIL Okay, then. Well, if you're satisfied, let's go. \nLARRY I said it's heavy. \nPHIL Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of wood. Wood is heavy. Actually. \nLARRY Yeah, I remember.    Finest poplar. Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside. He recoils. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Jesusjesusjesus... \nHe drops the lid and looks at Phil, horrified.   Phil walks over and looks inside. \nPHIL Gosh, they must have given us a full one. We'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and... \nLarry is staring at him with horror. \nLARRY Oh my God.     You stole Gram Parsons. \nPhil gives up. \nPHIL Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons. \nLARRY I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it. \nPHIL I'd save that line for court. \nAs the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops up and down in panic. Phil watches him. \nPHIL (CONT'D) What are you doing now? \nCON TINUE D: (3) \nLarry is losing control. \nLARRY I don't know! What am I doing? I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why am I here? Why am I with you? WHAT IS GOING ON? \nPHIL Calm down. \nLARRY I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop's bike, but now I'm a fucking body snatcher. PHIL Well, when you've quite finished, we should go. \nPHIL Do you have friends? \nLARRY Of course I have friends. \nPHIL Well, what would you do for them? \nLARRY Anything, within reason. \nPhil stares out of the window. PHIL That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net. \nLarry is confused. \nLARRY Tell me something - if it was the other way round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert? \nPhil says nothing. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Well? PHIL You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's wrong. \nPhil rubs his eyes, tired. Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels. Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT \nBernice fishtails across the road as Larry struggles to retain control. It eventually slides to a halt. Larry gets out and runs round to the drivers' door. \nINT. HEARSE. NIGHT \nLarry stares down at Phil. \nLARRY Ohmygod. \nHe slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel. He shouts at the unconscious Phil. LARRY (CONT'D) You made me do it, you bastard! I've never hit anyone in my life, but you pushed and you pushed and... you gave me no choice. \nLarry prods Phil to ensure he's unresponsive. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT \nThe hearse executes a wide U-turn before gently rejoining the highway and heading back towards town. A moment after completing the turn, the one remaining headlight stutters and goes out. Bernice pulls off the road. \nINT. HEARSE. NIGHT \nLARRY Shit. He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail. Then, in the distance, he sees a car approaching. Stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past. \nLARRY (CONT'D) Shit.   Shitshitshit. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT \nBernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after Stanley. \nINT. HEARSE. NIGHT \nPhil is motionless, and Larry peers out into the darkness as the car limps on, lit only from the light of the moon. Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'. \nCON TINUE D: He stops by the entrance to the inn and stares at Stanley's car parked in the bay outside room 8. He glances across at Phil, turns the car around and drives in. \nEXT. JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT \nBernice glides to a stop in the bay next to Stanley's car. Larry gets out and looks around. After a moment, he walks over to the door of room eight and knocks. \nEXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8 - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT \nA tired-looking Stanley opens the door. \nSTANLEY Yeah? LARRY Hi. \nSTANLEY Hello. \nThey stare at each other. \nLARRY Um. I'm one of the guys that took your son. \nAfter a moment, Stanley steps back and opens the door. \nSTANLEY You'd better come in. \nEXT. HIGHWAY/CAR PARK - JOSHUA TREE INN. NIGHT A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and skids across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next to the hearse. Barbara and Susie get out and look around. Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the hearse and attempts to open it. She can't. \nBARBARA Where's the catch on this piece of shit? \nSTANLEY You know I can't let you do that? \nPHIL I know you have to. Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table.   Everyone jumps. \nSTANLEY I don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my grief away from me. \nPHIL It's too late to claim him now. \nSTANLEY What the hell does that mean? \nThey are almost nose-to-nose now. \nPHIL It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late. That's what it means. \nSTANLEY I don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you. \nPHIL Not to me, no. \nStanley sits down. \nSTANLEY It's true that when Gram left college, we drifted apart. (MOR E) \nCON TINUE D: (2) STA NLEY (CONT'D) He was a disappointment to me, because he wouldn't use his brain. He had so much to offer, but he let it trickle away. \nPHIL No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved. \nSTANLEY I kept everything. Every record, every article, every photo. \nPHIL It's no good telling me.   You should have told him. \nSTANLEY I loved him. \nPHIL Too late... \nStanley looks up at Phil. \nSTANLEY I understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his friend? \nPHIL I was both, yes. STANLEY And that you weren't there when he died? When he needed you most? \nA beat, then: \nPHIL Yes.    That's right. \nSTANLEY So the guilt isn't all mine, then? \nPHIL I guess not. \nSusie walks over and takes Phil's hand. Stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears. \nCON TINUE D: (3) \nSTANLEY You boys took away my son. I lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again. \nHe starts to cry. Larry shoots an imploring look at Phil. Barbara glances around the room. \nBARBARA Can we just cut through this? \nShe gestures at Phil and Larry. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) You two stole the body. Theft. Indicates Susie. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck. Accessory. \nWaves a hand at Stanley. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) And you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't. Stupidity. \nShe walks over to the phone. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Now, let's just call the cops and get it done. The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest. \nPhil walks over to Barbara, picks her up and carries her into the bathroom. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Hey! What the hell are you doing? \nHe emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle, effectively locking the door. \nSTANLEY You don't need... \nLarry holds his hand up to stop Stanley. \nLARRY I've taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers, blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium, barbiturates, straight LSD, marijuana, marijuana laced with opium, nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour. STANLEY (dryly) That's very impressive, son. \nLARRY Not my point. \nPHIL Better make the point. \nLARRY I started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn't been a day when I didn't at least smoke one joint. \nPhil shoots Larry a dangerous look. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nPHIL Are we sure that this is helping? \nLarry ignores him. \nLARRY And now I've stopped. I stopped because it seems that I had something more important to do. \nThey all look at him.   He gestures at Phil. \nLARRY (CONT'D) He's doing this because he gave his word. I'm prepared to do this now because I think it's right. And because I believe that each body has a soul. And Gram's soul doesn't belong in a family plot surrounded by strangers. It belongs here, where he was happiest. \nIn the silence, Susie walks over and grips Phil's hand. Then Stanley gets up off the bed. \nSTANLEY I'm going to go say goodbye to my son. \nEveryone looks surprised. Phil gives Larry a look of appreciative approval. Barbara starts to kick furiously at the door from inside the bathroom. Stanley pauses for a moment, and then walks outside. Phil and Larry watch him go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil. PHIL What's that for? \nSUSIE That's for failing to reinforce my expectations. \nPHIL Well... I'll have to do that more often. \nThe three of them move to the door, and Phil turns to Larry. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Did you really take all those drugs? \nLARRY Of course not. \nCON TINUE D: (3) \nHe grins at Phil. \nLARRY (CONT'D) I may have got a little carried away... \nThe door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies across the room. \nPHIL C'mon, time to go... \nEXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8. NIGHT \nPhil, Larry and Susie leave room eight. They look around with surprise, but there is no sign of Stanley. Phil opens the back of the hearse and takes a quick peek inside the casket. \nPHIL Just checking. \nLARRY Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night. \nLarry is already behind the wheel.   Phil opens the car door and looks at Susie. \nPHIL Are you coming? \nShe smiles at him. SUSIE I reckon I am. \nShe gets in. There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight. The three of them look at each other, and then Bernice is gone into the darkness. A moment later Barbara runs outside. She leaps into her car and screeches after them. In the distance a blue flashing police light suddenly materializes. \nINT. BARBARA'S CAR. NIGHT \nBarbara is on the road, driving fast. Suddenly a blue flashing police light fills her mirror. \nBARBARA Thank God! \nShe pulls over and the police cruiser pulls in behind her. The traffic cop walks up and looks through the window. \nCON TINUE D: \nPhil stops pouring and shakes the can. \nPHIL Only a little left. \nHe pours the rest of the can into the casket. Susie walks over to stand next to Phil. He looks down at Gram. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when it mattered, but I was there before, and I've been there ever since. Gram, good luck to you, wherever you are. \nThey all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nPHIL (CONT'D) That's my last one, man. \nHe rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames. All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT \nThe traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance. Barbara just scowls. \nTRAFFIC COP Jesus!    What the hell's that? BARBARA That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire. \nTRAFFIC COP Get in the car, ma'am.   Now. \nEXT. DESERT. NIGHT \nPhil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin. The image disappears when Larry speaks. \nLARRY Maybe too much fuel. \nPHIL Nah, I just didn't factor in the booze inside of him. Gram always... \nHe breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the darkness, followed by a siren. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I think our work here is done. \nLarry and Susie run to the car. Phil lingers a moment, looking down at the flames. Then he follows the others. \nINT. HEARSE. NIGHT \nPhil jumps into the car. \nPHIL Go! \nCON TINUE D: \nThe huge car screeches off into the darkness, with no lights. \nINT. CAR. NIGHT \nStanley watches as the hearse flies past him. He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment. Then he turns on the ignition and drives away into the darkness. \nEXT. DESERT. NIGHT \nThe police car arrives at the scene.       Barbara and the cop get out. He peers into the flames. \nTRAFFIC COP How do you know it's your boyfriend? \nBARBARA (sarcastically) I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an observation? \nTRAFFIC COP Be my guest. \nBARBARA We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren. TRAFFIC COP Do you want to know what I think, ma'am? \nBARBARA No. But I'm really, really keen to find out. \nThe traffic cop stares into the fire. \nTRAFFIC COP I think it was suicide. He just wanted to get away from you. \nINT. HEARSE. DAWN \nPhil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger seat. He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen. He pulls a flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle, spitting the result out of the window. \nCON TINUE D: Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man sitting in the casket bay. \nGRAM Sure is hot. \n", "test1_input": "GRAND THEFT PARSONS \nWritten by \nJeremy Drysdale \nJune 2003 \nOPENING TITLE. \n\"ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY, CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.\" \nFADE IN: \nSUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'. \nINT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nA phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays. EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT \nA three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and he's in a hurry. \nINT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT \nTwo figures are struggling on the floor. The male is naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast. They appear to be having sex. \nEXT. TRIKE.

PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nThat phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves. \nINT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT \nA little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling. There is fear on her face. \nINT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nStill that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone. \nINT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT \nThe woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists. He is motionless underneath her. \nEXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN \nThe Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground. \nINT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nThe man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing stops. PHIL Hello? \nEXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT \nThe door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking quickly through the room. \nAs he searches, we hear: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Oh my God please help me! I found your number in his pocket and I don't know... I don't know what to do. \nPHIL'S VOICE Ah, what... who are you? WOMAN'S VOICE He's dead... he's dead... and I'm... just... I don't know what to do. \nThe man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers. \nPHIL'S VOICE Hold on.   Tell me who's dead. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just... \nPHIL'S VOICE Are you sure he's dead? \nHe looks under the beds. \nCON TINUE D: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Yeah. He's really dead.

I'm goin'... \nHe picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face. \nEXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING \nThe Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital. There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background. Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks to the entrance. \nINT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER \nWe move through the reception area up to the nurses' station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurse's uniform. \nNURSE You wanna run that by me again, sir? \nPHIL Okay. I'd like to see Gram Parsons. \nThey stare at each other. \nCON TINUE D: \nNURSE You want to see Gram Parsons? \nPHIL Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a gurney standing by in case I need to move him? \nShe looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked cigar. \nNURSE And you are.... his physician? Or perhaps a close relative? Phil clears his throat. \nPHIL Actually, I'm his road manager. \nThe big nurse smiles mirthlessly. \nNURSE So you're not his physician or a close relative? \nA beat. \nPHIL No. \nNURSE Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir. \nShe turns away. \nPHIL Now listen here... \nNURSE No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us. \nThe nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'. \nINT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING \nPhil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash. He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING \nPhil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'. \nINT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING \nThe room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath. PHIL Sheesh! \nHe walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet.   He stares down at the body, visibly moved. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Hello buddy. How you been? \nHe stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Well, I can't stand around here chatting with you all day.

MORNING \nThe clerk scribbles on a form. \nCLERK Papers? \nPHIL They'll be along. With this being a rush job, they said you'd understand. He passes a folded banknote across.      The clerk pockets it without a change of expression. \nCLERK Well, you'd better tell them that we've got rules. \nThe men stare at each other. Then Phil pulls another note out of his pocket and passes that over. Again, the clerk pockets it. \nCLERK (CONT'D) And this is the exception which proves that particular rule. \nA beat.   Then: \nCLERK (CONT'D) Although you don't need to tell them that. \nCON TINUE D: \nPhil smiles broadly at him. The clerk turns and selects a casket from a gurney behind the counter. \nCLERK (CONT'D) And this... is your deceased. \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nPhil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar. He can see Larry peering through the window at him. He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching Larry from the other side of the street. As he speeds up to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from his desk. \nCLERK Good luck with her. \nPhil closes his eyes and slows to a halt. \nEXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY.

Is that your hearse? \nLarry turns slowly. \nLARRY Hearse? \nThe cop points at Bernice. COP That hearse. \nLarry has started to sweat profusely. \nLARRY That hearse? \nThe cop looks at him carefully. \nCOP Are you okay, sir? \nLARRY Okay?

MORNING \nStanley has his eyes closed. The fat man eats. Suddenly, Stanley's eyes snap open and he peers out of the window. A motorized cart chugs into view with the casket covered in a blanket on the back. It is driving away from the plane. \nSTANLEY What the hell? \nHe stands up and turns to the fat man. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) Excuse me. \nPJ GAMBRELL Why? \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY I need to get off the plane. \nThe fat man reluctantly struggles to his feet and squeezes out into the aisle. \nPJ GAMBRELL Sheesh.

CLERK What's the hurry? \nPhil is distracted, watching the cop and Larry out of the window. \nPHIL I'd like to get to the Joshua Tree while it's still light. \nThe clerk looks up. \nCLERK I thought you were taking him to New Orleans? \nPHIL What? CLERK When you came in, you said you were driving the casket out to New Orleans. But just now you said you were headed for the Joshua Tree... \n", "test3_input": "CLERK A luxury casket of solid mahogany, finished with a split- hinged lid, eight brass plated casket handles and an engraved inscription plate. \nINT. LA DEPARTMENT OF BIRTHS MARRIAGES & DEATHS. MORNING \nBarbara is sitting in a cubicle opposite a middle-aged woman in a suit. Her allure appears lost on the official, who gives the dress a disapproving look. \nBARBARA Parsons. \nOFFICIAL Parsons.   And he's a... musician? \nShe says 'musician' with great distaste. \nBARBARA Was.   He was a musician. \nThe woman flicks through some papers on her desk.   Barbara watches her. Eventually: \nOFFICIAL I'm afraid we have no official notification of death. \nWith a flourish, Barbara places a copy of the LA Times on the table. The headline is 'Country-Rock Pioneer Dead' in large black print. The official glances at it and gives a thin smile. \nCON TINUE D: \nOFFICIAL (CONT'D) At this current time, the Greater Los Angeles registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths does not regard the local newspaper as an official recorder of record. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nLarry is staring at Phil.      Waiting. \nPHIL Can we please talk about this later? This is not a great place to be right now. Larry moves to get out of the car.        Phil grabs his arm. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Oh, just a minute. Now I understand... You think there's a body back there. \nHe starts to laugh. \nPHIL (CONT'D) You think there's a body in the coffin! \nLarry watches him laugh.      Phil catches the look and stops laughing. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I can fully understand why you'd think that. I mean, it is a coffin and all. But would I - would I really - steal a real live dead body? \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nStanley and the clerk are staring at each other. \nSTANLEY You just gave the body away? \nCLERK Well, it's not like this is a bank. People round here don't generally take dead bodies they're not entitled to. \nSTANLEY Why did you give it to him? \nCON TINUE D: \nCLERK Well, he signed for it. \nSTANLEY Who signed for it? \nThe clerk peers at his paperwork.        When he eventually speaks, it is wearily. \nCLERK John Nobody. \nSTANLEY And where do I find this John Nobody? The clerk's attention switches to a point just above Stanley's shoulder. He points out through the window to where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away. \nCLERK There. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nLarry is staring at Phil. \nLARRY Empty? \nPHIL Absolutely, completely, totally. \nLARRY It looked pretty heavy, for an empty casket. \nPHIL They are made of finest... poplar. That's very heavy wood. \nLARRY Poplar? No way?   Mahogany, or oak, but not... \n", "test3_true": "Larry stares hard at Phil. We see the door of the mortuary open over Larry's shoulder and Stanley and the clerk emerge. Then: \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY Okay. So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car? \nPhil glances at the approaching Stanley. \nPHIL I'm... selling them on to a company in Palm Springs. Lots of stiffs, lots of money. And then of course, it's very environmentally sound. And... look, under the circumstances, perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us. Larry still stares at Phil.      Stanley is almost at the car. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth two grand. \nStanley is getting ever closer. Phil can see him in his wing mirror. Larry releases the safety brake and the giant car roars away, leaving Stanley standing in a cloud of dust. \nINT. LA DEPARTMENT OF BIRTHS MARRIAGES & DEATHS. MORNING \nBarbara picks up the newspaper and rips it into pieces, which she scatters onto the desk. She walks towards the door. \nOFFICIAL Don't forget now... \nBarbara keeps walking. \nOFFICIAL (CONT'D) Notification of death. \nBarbara is gone, the door slamming behind her. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nLarry drives. Phil is still pitching.        They are driving alongside the airport runway. \nPHIL So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them. \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY As new? \nPHIL Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins. \nLARRY The whole thing is completely immoral. \nPHIL Yeah, well. I saw how outraged you were back there, when I mentioned money. Just think of it as recycling. \nLARRY Look, I really need to get home. \nPHIL Why? \nLARRY I just... do. \nLarry is sweating. \nPHIL Well, while I acknowledge the power of your argument, we have to be somewhere else. So just settle back and enjoy the ride. Larry slows the car down. \nPHIL (CONT'D) What now? \nLARRY Gas now. \nLarry pulls the car onto a Gas station forecourt. \nEXT. GAS STATION FORECOURT. DAY \nAn attendant is filling Bernice.           He looks Phil over. \nATTENDANT You an undertaker? \nPHIL Sure am. \nCON TINUE D: \nATTENDANT Ain't yer surposed to be in black? \nPHIL Nope. We're special rock 'n roll undertakers. Musical morticians. \nINT. REST ROOM - GAS STATION. DAY \nLarry is sitting on the toilet seat - still fully dressed but bent double with cramps. Then Phil bangs on the door and calls from outside. \nPHIL (O.S) C'mon, hippie - let's roll. \n"}

MORNING \nStanley is standing at the Airport Airlines check-in desk, facing the check-in clerk. \nSTANLEY Parsons. \nThe clerk checks her paperwork. \nCHECK-IN CLERK You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons? \nSTANLEY Yes. \nCHECK-IN CLERK And you're flying directly back to New Orleans? On the same plane? \nSTANLEY That is correct. \nThe clerk awaits an explanation, but none is forthcoming. She raises an eyebrow. \nCHECK-IN CLERK Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at Los Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons. \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY Thank you. \nStanley turns to go, but then pauses. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) I've come to pick up my son's body. \nThe line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk wobbles slightly. Stanley raises his voice. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) My son died out here, you see? So I've come to bring him home. Everyone looks at Stanley.            Stanley looks at the clerk. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) I'm wondering if that's enough information for you? \nCHECK-IN CLERK Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll... see to it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir. \nSTANLEY Most kind. \nINT. BANK. MORNING \nThere is a line leading to the information desk, but Barbara ignores it. She walks up to a female teller, who is serving another customer, and cuts in. BARBARA I'd like to see the manager, please. \nCUSTOMER Wait your turn. \nBarbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip trembles. \nBARBARA I'm sorry. It's just that the man I loved died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners... \nShe dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief.           The customer looks embarrassed. \nCUSTOMER I'm sorry.     Please... go ahead. \nCON TINUE D: \nBarbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look.   The teller responds with a similar look. \nBARBARA The manager? \nEXT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nA man unlocks the shutters with a clatter and goes inside. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches, before getting out of the car. \nEXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary. \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nThe clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar. \nCLERK Can I help you? \nPHIL I'm here to pick up a... coffin. \n", "test1_true": "PHIL Yes I am. \nCLERK No. You're here to pick up a casket. \nPhil looks irritated. \nPHIL Okay.   A casket. \nCLERK What flight number? \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL It   was due out on the next flight to   New Orleans, but I'm driving it   now. The stiff doesn't like to   fly. \nThe clerk stares at him. \nCLERK You're one of those funny guys, right. \nPHIL Yeah, but it's my day off. \nCLERK Name? \nPHIL Mine or the...? \nCLERK The deceased. \nPhil moves to the desk. \nPHIL Parsons. \nThe clerk turns and shouts over his shoulder. \nCLERK Barney - bring up Parsons. \nINT. BANK - MANAGER'S OFFICE. MORNING The Bank Manager is staring at the piece of paper. \nBANK MANAGER I simply can't give you any money based on this piece of paper. \nBarbara is totally calm. \nBARBARA It's not a piece of paper. It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money. \nBANK MANAGER Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly, subject to a valid will existing. \nCON TINUE D: \nShe just looks at him.      He tries again. \nBANK MANAGER (CONT'D) Mister Parsons was a customer of ours. We can't just pass his money across to someone who says they're in the will. There are... rules. \nBarbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry. \nBARBARA You don't seem to understand. These are his wishes. Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable. He gives her his handkerchief. \nBANK MANAGER No... I do... understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do. \nBARBARA Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money. \nBANK MANAGER Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead. \nBARBARA Are you saying that I'm lying? BANK MANAGER No, absolutely not. But getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step. \nINT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING \nStanley takes a swig from a hip flask and looks out of the window. A very overweight, red-faced man squeezes into the next seat. He bangs Stanley with his knee as he sits, but Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of the window. He is watching the cargo being loaded. \nP. J. GAMBRELL Paw on the space, don'tcha think? \nStanley turns slowly. \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY I'm sorry? \nThe fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley shakes awkwardly and reluctantly. \nP.

LA DEPARTMENT OF BIRTHS MARRIAGES & DEATHS. MORNING \nBarbara is sitting in a cubicle opposite a middle-aged woman in a suit. Her allure appears lost on the official, who gives the dress a disapproving look. \nBARBARA Parsons. \nOFFICIAL Parsons.   And he's a... musician? \nShe says 'musician' with great distaste. \nBARBARA Was.   He was a musician. \nThe woman flicks through some papers on her desk.   Barbara watches her. Eventually: \nOFFICIAL I'm afraid we have no official notification of death. \nWith a flourish, Barbara places a copy of the LA Times on the table. The headline is 'Country-Rock Pioneer Dead' in large black print. The official glances at it and gives a thin smile. \nCON TINUE D: \nOFFICIAL (CONT'D) At this current time, the Greater Los Angeles registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths does not regard the local newspaper as an official recorder of record. \nINT.

You think there's a body back there. \nHe starts to laugh. \nPHIL (CONT'D) You think there's a body in the coffin! \nLarry watches him laugh.      Phil catches the look and stops laughing. \nPHIL (CONT'D) I can fully understand why you'd think that. I mean, it is a coffin and all. But would I - would I really - steal a real live dead body? \nINT. MORTUARY. MORNING \nStanley and the clerk are staring at each other. \nSTANLEY You just gave the body away? \nCLERK Well, it's not like this is a bank. People round here don't generally take dead bodies they're not entitled to. \nSTANLEY Why did you give it to him? \nCON TINUE D: \nCLERK Well, he signed for it. \nSTANLEY Who signed for it? \nThe clerk peers at his paperwork.        When he eventually speaks, it is wearily. \nCLERK John Nobody. \nSTANLEY And where do I find this John Nobody? The clerk's attention switches to a point just above Stanley's shoulder. He points out through the window to where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away. \nCLERK There. \nINT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING \nLarry is staring at Phil. \nLARRY Empty? \nPHIL Absolutely, completely, totally. \nLARRY It looked pretty heavy, for an empty casket. \nPHIL They are made of finest... poplar. That's very heavy wood. \nLARRY Poplar? No way?   Mahogany, or oak, but not... \n", "test2_true": "Larry stares hard at Phil. We see the door of the mortuary open over Larry's shoulder and Stanley and the clerk emerge. Then: \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY Okay. So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car? \nPhil glances at the approaching Stanley. \nPHIL I'm... selling them on to a company in Palm Springs. Lots of stiffs, lots of money. And then of course, it's very environmentally sound. And... look, under the circumstances, perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us. Larry still stares at Phil.      Stanley is almost at the car. \nPHIL (CONT'D) Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth two grand. \nStanley is getting ever closer. Phil can see him in his wing mirror. Larry releases the safety brake and the giant car roars away, leaving Stanley standing in a cloud of dust. \nINT. LA DEPARTMENT OF BIRTHS MARRIAGES & DEATHS. MORNING \nBarbara picks up the newspaper and rips it into pieces, which she scatters onto the desk. She walks towards the door. \nOFFICIAL Don't forget now... \nBarbara keeps walking. \nOFFICIAL (CONT'D) Notification of death. \nBarbara is gone, the door slamming behind her. \nINT. HEARSE. DAY \nLarry drives. Phil is still pitching.        They are driving alongside the airport runway. \nPHIL So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them. \nCON TINUE D: \nLARRY As new? \nPHIL Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins. \nLARRY The whole thing is completely immoral. \nPHIL Yeah, well. I saw how outraged you were back there, when I mentioned money. Just think of it as recycling. \nLARRY Look, I really need to get home. \nPHIL Why? \nLARRY I just... do. \nLarry is sweating. \nPHIL Well, while I acknowledge the power of your argument, we have to be somewhere else. So just settle back and enjoy the ride. Larry slows the car down. \nPHIL (CONT'D) What now? \nLARRY Gas now. \nLarry pulls the car onto a Gas station forecourt. \nEXT. GAS STATION FORECOURT.

DAY \nWe are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burger from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries. He slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waiter enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the food arrives. \nPHIL You frighten him. \nLARRY I do not. \nPHIL Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover. \nThey both look at Larry's bread and lettuce. \nCON TINUE D: \nPHIL (CONT'D) It's probably the rabbit food. \nLARRY Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay? \nPHIL I understand. Really I do. That stuff'll mess you right up every time. \nPhil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go. \nINT. STANLEY'S CAR. DAY. Stanley is driving along the road. He puts his hand in his pocket, takes out his hip flask, pops the lid and goes to take a drink. It's empty. Then he notices the dinosaur. \nINT. THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY \nPhil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer. He gets up. Larry notices he hasn't eaten anything. \nLARRY I thought you were hungry. \nPhil ignores him. \nPHIL Gotta make a call. \nHe glances around and then walks over to the bar. PHIL (CONT'D) Hey man, where's the phone? \nBARMAN Out back. \nHe jerks his head by way of direction. Phil wanders off just as the door opens and Stanley walks in. \nSTANLEY Good afternoon. \nBARMAN Yup. \nSTANLEY Do you have a telephone I might use? \nBARMAN In a minute, I do. \nCON TINUE D: \nSTANLEY In a minute? \nBARMAN Yeah.

Shopping, or something. \nPhil pours the rest of his beer down his throat, before signaling the barman to serve him another. \nPHIL Yeah, that'll be it.     Shopping. \nHe raises an eyebrow at Larry. Behind him, we see Stanley walk in and take a seat at the bar. \nSTANLEY (to barman) Beer. The barman gives Stanley his beer. \nSTANLEY (CONT'D) Would you put a scotch in there, please? \nBARMAN Sure. \nHe pours the spirit in. \nBARMAN (CONT'D) Bad day? \nStanley rubs the top of his head. \nSTANLEY Yeaaaaah.    Yeah, a real bad day. BARMAN What happened? \nSTANLEY My boy died out here the other day, and some punks have stolen his body. \nStanley reaches for his pocket.          The barman puts his hand up to refuse the money. \nBARMAN That's worth a shot on the house. \nThe barman tips a little more scotch into the beer. \nSTANLEY Thanks. \nCON TINUE D: (2) \nStanley takes a drink.     Phil slips some money on the bar and stands up. \nPHIL (to Larry) We gotta go. \nLarry is listening to the conversation. \nLARRY Haven't finished my drink. \nBARMAN (to Stanley) Why would someone steal a body? Phil picks up the glass of water and drinks it down. \nPHIL All gone.     C'mon. \nHe turns and walks to the door. \nSTANLEY Well, maybe they were souvenir hunters or something. My boy's kinda famous... \nBARMAN Who is he? \nPhil is back. \nSTANLEY Gram Parsons.

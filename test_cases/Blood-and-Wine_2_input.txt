ALEX It's late, Jason. 
JASON I'm going out tonight. Alex exhales. 
ALEX You can't'fish all night and work all day. 
JASON Working for you doesn't exactly tax my mind. 
ALEX No wonder you drop bottles. 
JASON Fire me. 
ALEX Do you do it on purpose? 
JASON Fishing bought me my bike. 
(CONTINUED) 
10 CONTINUED: 
ALEX I almost knocked it over trying to get out of the car. 
JASON 
(SARCASTIC) I wasn't sure you were coming home. 
SEVERS The TOASTER OVEN DINGS. Jason takes out a muffin, it in two with his fishing knife. 
ALEX Use a regular knife. 
JASON This has a better edge. Feel it (pointing it at Alex, 
BLADE FLAT) -- feel it. Their voices are rising. 
ALEX Pointed, it's a fucking weapon. Put it away. 
JASON Hell with you. Jason exits to the stairs. 
ALEX And keep your voice down. Your mother's asleep. 
STAIRS 
JASON If you got home on time once in a while, maybe she could skip the chemical help. Alex is also on the stairs. 
ALEX You have no idea, none, zip, what goes on in a marriage. 
JASON Yeah, well, I'm learning more than I want to.

LANDING UPSTAIRS 
SUZANNE (O .S=.. ) Now what are you arguing about? 
SUZANNE is a pretty young woman in her late thirties with a sense of humor and irony. She's chemically relaxed, but not stupefied. She pulls a robe around herself, modest in front of her son; and although her body's not spectacular, like Gabriella's, she has a trim. athletic build. 
JASON It's not an argument. 
ALEX I asked him to clean up downstairs. 
SUZANNE 
(SOOTHING ALEX) Maybe he hadn't finished- 
ALEX A modicum of cooperation, you know? 
JASON A modicum. What's that. Modicum my ass. He pushes past his mother toward his own room. Suzanne follows him down the hallway, leaving. Alex behind. 
SUZANNE I don't like that tone from: you. 
JASON Then go to bed. 
ALEX Hey! 
JASON 
(RIGHT BACK) What! 
SUZANNE It's too late for this. 
ALEX Jason has gone into his room. He slams the door.

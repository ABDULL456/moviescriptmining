Will? Will? 
No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears. 
WILL 
Wow! 
The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space. 
SMITH 
William, wait! 
WILL 
See, over here I'm in the future. 
(steps back towards Smith) 
Here I'm in the past. Don't worry. If my theories are correct, these doorways should remain stable, for a while anyway. 
SMITH 
I can barely contain my glee. Why aren't you aging like the plants? 
WILL 
That's just an effect of the portals forming. Once they stabilize you can cross from one time to another just like stepping between two rooms. 
(off his tracker) 
Dad's signal is this way. Come on, Doctor Smith. 
Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold. 
SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared. Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush. 
Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush, revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens. 
WILL (OVER) 
What did you find? 
Will has returned. 
SMITH 
Come, come, son, no time for distractions. Let's move on. 
Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw. 
PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible. Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson. 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES 
John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker. 
JOHN 
Damn. 
WEST 
Damn? Damn is not good. 
JOHN 
The radiation signature we've been tracking. it's a  ghost. A reflection from the Jupiter Two bouncing off the ore in these walls. There's no core material here. 
(OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the crater aging and crumbling in it's wake. 
John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees, roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker, more deserted future. 
JOHN 
The ship's back that way. we have to go through. 
EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT 
Penny is pushing through the forest. 
PENNY 
Blip? I'm sorry. Blip? 
She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker, the sky red. Blip steps through the portal. 
PENNY 
Blip, wait. 
Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following. 
EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE 
Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs and caverns cut into the crater wall. 
BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down, CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly. 
PENNY 
Blip, you can't run off like that. 
(closing on the stone) 
What the-? 
THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship. 
HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted. 
PENNY (OVER) 
Some kind of fight, in space. It almost looks like the probe ship Major West blew up. 
HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface. 
PENNY 
That could be the Jupiter Two crash landing. 
HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's. 
Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves. 
SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard monkeys, two large, two smaller. 
Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon. 
BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK. 
PENNY 
Blip, no! 
Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness. 
Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical. 
The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort. 
GIANT BLIP 
Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice. 
Penny stares up in stunned wonder.

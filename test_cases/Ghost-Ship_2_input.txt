EPPS (V.O.) NO!!!! 
BACK TO SCENE 
The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned state. 
KATIE It isn't real. 
Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands. 
KATIE Many bad things have happened here. But you mustn't allow the evil inside. I tell you this because you can see me. The others can't. But you must leave. You must leave. 
A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns back Katie is gone. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio. 
MURPHY Epps to Murphy. 
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK. 
EPPS Epps to Murphy. 
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be seen. 
As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out. 
A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF METAL follows it. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across. 
The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a mine field for a drifting ship. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas duffle. 
EPPS What happened? 
MURPHY We hit land. 
EPPS What? 
MURPHY We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one. 
EPPS Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull precariously. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down. 
AT THE OTHER END 
Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face down in the passage. 
They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the body over. It is Greer, dead. 
EPPS He's been shot. 
Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes. 
MURPHY Let's get the hell out of here. 
INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft. 
MURPHY It should be enough to get us to one of those islands. Gimme a hand, wouldya? 
She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to the rail. 
MURPHY Prop it here. We need to pull these braces off. There's a hammer on the stand. There. 
Epps crosses back to the stands. 
AT THE STANDS

CARRIE Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come in. 
They walk in, Carrie closes the door.

CHARLOTTE Look, the people who don't know -- will only see the beautiful pictures. The people who do know will only see what an asshole he is. (beat; to Lily) Mommy said a bad word. 
CARRIE (looks down to Lily) Hi, honey. 
Lily holds up a little baby pumpkin to Carrie. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) For me? 
Lily nods. Carrie has to lighten up. She kneels to Lily. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) And what are you going to be for Halloween? 
LILY Cinderella. 
CHARLOTTE Or -- we also brought Mulan. 
Lily shakes her head: NO. Carrie smiles.

Lily nods Carrie smiles. Harry knocks on a door. It opens. A PARK AVE WOMAN (40), stylish - stands there with treats. 
CHARLOTTE/HARRY/LILY Trick or treat! 
The woman smiles -- then suddenly, her smile fades.

Raining outside. Louise walks in, looks around. 
CARRIE Louise! 
Double-take. Carrie is waving to her from a table. 
LOUISE Oh my Lord. I did not even recognize you. 
CARRIE That's the point. My head is the witness protection program. 
LOUISE I'm really feeling that look on you. 
Louise reaches into her purse to get something -- 
CARRIE And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you. 
LOUISE Mine till Tuesday. 
Louise pulls out a cell phone and holds it out to her. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) Here -- time to re-join the world. 
CARRIE Already?

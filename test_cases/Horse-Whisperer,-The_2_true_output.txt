ANNIE Of course not. 
LIZ Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio. 
In the back seat of ANNIE'S SUBURBAN sits Grace -- her back to the action. Hearing Pilgrim's struggle. Putting her walkman on her ears and raising the volume... We hear -- 
GRACE'S MUSIC, ON THE SOUNDTRACK, bringing us to: 
EXT. A HIGHWAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA - DAY 
Annie's Suburban drives along Route 80, pulling the horse trailer behind. 
INT. SUBURBAN - DAY 
Grace, in the back seat, wearing her headphones, listening to her music (maybe LIZ PHAIR OR HOLLY COLE). Detached. Non- committal. As trucks pass by, their time slapping the pavement, she reacts and turns to the other window. 
Annie, in sunglasses, shifts her attention between the road and her rear-view mirror -- checking on Grace. 
EXT. HIGHWAY IN - EARLY MORNING 
The Suburban drives as the sun begins to set. 
EXT. MOTEL IN OHIO - NIGHT 
The Suburban and Horse Trailer are parked in the lot. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM, OHIO - NIGHT 
A small furnished motel room with two twin beds. 
Grace sits up in bed watching TV, with no expression. A sitcom with canned laughter serves as a hypnotic drug. 
Annie enters from the bathroom, after showering, drying her hair. Grace doesn't bother to look up. 
ANNIE You want to take your bath? (Grace shakes her head) We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- 
GRACE Fine -- I'll take my bath. 
She begins moving off the bed. 
ANNIE No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- 
GRACE -- enough time tomorrow. I know. 
ANNIE Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine. 
GRACE (interrupts on "fine") I don't care. 
Annie realizes she may have pushed too hard, but she also realizes there's no talking to Grace now. So, she achieves her goal -- 
JANNIE Take it now. 
Grace hobbles off the bed, enters the bathroom and shuts the door. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM IN OHIO - NIGHT 
The lights are off. Annie lays in bed, wide awake. It is the middle of the night. 
Grace, asleep in the other bed, begins whimpering. She's having a bad dream. Annie rises -- considering whether or not to intercede... Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in fear... Annie appears right by her side. 
ANNIE What, sweetheart? What? 
Shaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at that moment. She wraps her arms around her, tightly, and tries to catch her breath. 
ANNIE It's sleeping in a strange bed, that's all. Happens sometimes. It's Ok. It's OK. 
EXT. ANOTHER ROAD, MID-WEST - DAY 
The Suburban continues its journey. 
Once again -- Annie, in the front, and Grace, in the rear, drive without a word between them. 
INT. SUBURBAN - DAY 
Grace and Annie occupy their same positions. Annie is on the car phone with her office. 
ANNIE Okay, listen -- let's do this. When I get to the next motel, I'll see if they have a fax. If not, I'll call you tomorrow to -- 
Annie continues O.S. when we hear a shifting, a rocking in the trailer behind them. As if Pilgrim made a sudden move. Grace quickly turns her head. Annie looks in the rear view at Grace. 
ANNIE Uh Lucy, look, I have to go. OK... Later. 
Annie hangs up and smiles at Grace through the mirror. Grace reaches for her walkman and headphones. Annie offers; 
ANNIE Grace! GRACE! 
Grace lowers one side of her headphones; 
ANNIE Would you like to put your music on up here? 
Grace shrugs. Annie shrugs it off as well. Grace replaces the headphone. Annie turns on the radio -- nothing but country or gospel or religious talk shows... She shuts it off. Frustrated, Annie looks up ahead and sees: 
A TRUCK STOP DINER 
Annie yells to be heard through the headphones; 
ANNIE IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!? 
GRACE (shrugs) Whatever you want. 
ANNIE Fine! 
GRACE Fine. 
Annoyed, Annie pulls onto the gravel and stops, talking to herself -- 
ANNIE Fine! 
She exits the car, banging the door. As she walks acrund the car to help Grace, she talks to herself in a sarcastic whisper: 
ANNIE "Whatever you want!" Well, this is what I want. I want to eat lunch and I want to smoke a cigarette and I want to keep talking to myself for the next two thousand fucking miles..."! 
She opens Grace's door. Grace senses her mother's anger.

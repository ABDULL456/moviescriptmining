RHIANNON What's his name then? 
OLIVE (WAXING CUTE) Who? My brother? 
RHIANNON Stop stalling. You're totally trying to come up with a name. Just say it. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE I'm not proud of this. Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it. Okay, have you guys ever watched `The Brady Bunch'? Of course you haven't. You're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on MTV. That's why I knew I could get away with it. See, there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved. The name of her imaginary boyfriend WAS -- 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
OLIVE (Into the phone) George Glass. 
RHIANNON George? What kind of a fucking name is George? 
OLIVE He's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so I said yes. 
Although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified. 
RHIANNON If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth. 
OLIVE Deal. 
INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS 
Rhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth. 
RHIANNON (With her mouth full) You're not off the hook, you know. I want lurid details. This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine. 
OLIVE I'm sure you'll have a good time. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Rhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
To her webcam -- 
OLIVE (Through the proverbial CLENCHED TEETH) Even though we now hate each other, Rhi, I really hope you're watching this. Because this part's for you. The lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all-too- imaginary, yet surprisingly satisfying George Glass: 
Ken Nordine's beat poem `OLIVE,' (from the late 60's album `Colors'), underscored to jazz, plays as we see a montage of OLIVE'S WEEKEND: 
In her bedroom, Olive -- 
-- watches `The Notebook,' pining over Ryan Gosling. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) Olive. Poor thing. 
-- paints her toenails Jungle Red. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sits and thinks that it's drab. Sure does. Sits and sits and sits and sits and THINKS about it's olive drab drab. 
-- dances to the jazz music, but alone, in her underwear and a t-shirt that declares: `Hands off.' 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) DOESN'T KNOW that it is about to be named `Color of the Year,' by those with the nose for the new. By the passionate few. Yeah... 
-- reads TEEN PEOPLE magazine. 
KEN NORDINE (CONT'D) Olive is definitely in. EVERYTHING that can possibly mean (MORE) 
KEN NORDINE (CONT'D) anything! Anywhere! At least for a year. 
-- dances some more. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Has got to be Olive! Did you hear that Olive? Did ya? Know what it means? Oh Olive! There'll be olive cars and olive trucks and olive chickens and olive ducks and olive socks and olive garters And olive brakes and olive starters! Olive, sorry! Olive, please! OLIVE WHATNOTS and olive trees! Olive trees? What a quaint notion... Olive trees. (CHUCKLING) Olive. 
Out of breath from dancing, she walks over and displaces the NEEDLE from the KEN NORDINE ALBUM she's playing.

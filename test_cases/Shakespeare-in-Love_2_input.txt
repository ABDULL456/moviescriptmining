URCHIN I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives. 
WILL Oh. What is your name? 
URCHIN. John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty. 
Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest. The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches the result with sober interest. 
URCHIN (CONT'D) Plenty of blood. That is the only writing. 
WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy. 
URCHIN (CONT'D) Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off. 
WILL I have to get back.

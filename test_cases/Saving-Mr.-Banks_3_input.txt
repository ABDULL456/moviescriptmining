DISNEY He's? 
PAMELA I just-- Goodbye Mr Disney. She goes to get in the car and Disney puts a hand to stop her but Ralph blocks it. 
RALPH The lady's ready to go now sir. Walt steps away and Ralph closes the door to the car. 
WALT He's? Walt watches the car disappear, wracked with frustration and confusion. He takes a seat on Pamela's bench and wraps his arms around himself and looks to the sky. 
EXT. LAX - DAY 
Ralph climbs out of the limo and opens the back door for Pamela. He gestures for a valet to come and take her bags and opens the trunk of the car. 
RALPH It's been a pleasure driving you Mrs. 
PAMELA No one likes a fibber. 
RALPH 
(CHUCKLES) I really have enjoyed it. Didn't know who you were at first and then guess what? 
PAMELA You found out? 
RALPH I was telling my daughter all about my day and how I was driving this nice writer lady, Mrs Travers for Mr Disney and-- 
PAMELA 
AND-- 
RALPH 
AND-- (he leans into the 
PASSENGER WINDOW) And she makes me go to her bedroom and get this! (he pulls out a Mary 
POPPINS BOOK) Can't stop reading it. I'm very slow mind you. Pamela smiles. 
PAMELA Would you like me to sign it? 
RALPH 
(DELIGHTED) Would you?! 
PAMELA I'd be honoured. Ralph hands her his pen and she begins to write. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Your daughters name? 
RALPH Jane. 
PAMELA Really? 
RALPH Uh huh. Like the girl in the book. 
PAMELA (reading as she writes) To Jane and her dearest father-- (she looks at him) I've just this instant realized I don't know your name. 
RALPH Ralph. She shakes his hand. 
PAMELA Pamela. 
RALPH Pamela. 
PAMELA You're the only American I have ever liked, Ralph. Ralph is chuffed to bits. 
RALPH May I ask why? 
PAMELA No. Now take this-- She hands him the piece of Beverly Hills Hotel stationery with her notes on. 
RALPH 
(READING) Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo-- 
(BEAT) What is this? 
PAMELA They all had difficulties. Jane can do anything that anyone else can do, do you understand? Ralph looks at her in awe. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Look at the bottom. 
RALPH Walt Disney! 
PAMELA Deficiencies in concentration and hyperactive behavior. Explains everything! Pamela turns to leave.

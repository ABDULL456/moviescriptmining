Nearby, Mike and Danny observe them. 
DANNY -- He doing her? 
MIKE Some detective you are. They stopped. 
FRED Really? I wonder if she likes white guys. 
DANNY I wonder if she likes bald guys. 
Hub, meanwhile, congratulates Frank's wife, NAJIBA. 
HUB You must be so proud... 
NAJIBA Small children, small worries. Big children -- 
FRANK -- big orthodontia bills. Someday, you'll understand. 
And then Frank notices Hub's DRIVER standing in the doorway. 
FRANK Where we going? 
HUB You're staying with your family. I'm back in the morning.

INT. HUB'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING 
Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank enters. 
FRANK You sleep here? (Hub smiles, but doesn't look up) Immigration called. 
A SMALL GREEN ROOM -- AS SEEN THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR 
Hub and Frank watch a dark-skinned MAN being questioned by a uniformed OFFICIAL. An INS Supervisor shows them a false- bottomed suitcase stuffed with money. 
INS OFFICIAL -- all in small bills. So we figure, smurf, right? Then I think, considering the gentleman's nationality, plus where he's been recently, we better call Frank. 
FRANK -- who's trying to score points with his boss, bigtime. 
HUB Has he broken any laws? 
INS OFFICIAL No, sir. He's twenty bucks under the $10,000 limit. 
FRANK (pulls out a $20 bill) Not anymore. 
IN THE ROOM 
The official hopes volume breaks the language barrier. 
UNIFORMED OFFICIAL ...so, Kahlil, you're saying this is an INHERITANCE? Somebody DIED and you're bringing them the MONEY? 
The dark-skinned man is trying to keep up: 
KAHLIL No, no... dhouri. 
BEHIND THE MIRROR 
FRANK ...He means, "dowry." 
HUB Check out his neck. 
Small puckered SCARS. The INS guy looks confused. 
FRANK The tabac. (mimics putting out a cigarette on his arm) Sssssss... The territories. 
HUB (thinks a moment) Put him in play. 
CUT TO: 
THE VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY 
Hub and Frank in a rental CONTOUR, tail Khalil, in a cab: 
HUB (on the phone) -- on the Van Wyck... No, not yet. (to Frank) -- What are we in? 
FRANK A '97 Contour. On my Visa. (watches Khalil) Back home, the security services'd be up this guy's ass with a poker, but what do we do, we let him go. 
HUB (still on the phone) ...Six teams on the ground, at least... well, pull 'em off the UN... (to Haddad) Stay back... 
FRANK Not my first date, Hub. (the TAXI changes lanes) He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's Brooklyn. 
HUB (still on the phone) I want husbands and wives, I want baby carriages, and no Brooks Brothers. 
FRANK You're micro-managing. 
HUB (still on the phone) -- And find me a judge I can work with. We want sound on this guy... damn'... I'm losing you... (raises his voice) And bring us a radio. 
FRANK I get reimbursed for this, right?

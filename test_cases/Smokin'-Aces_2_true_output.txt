MARGIE (CONT'D) (motioning to pills) Them was left over from my hysterectomy, so they're a few years old, might be outta date. 
Elmore eyes the labels; Vicodin, Vioxx...morphine-based. Nice...Just numb it all. 
MARGIE (CONT'D) You sure you don't want me to call an ambulance honey? (MORE) 
MARGIE (CONT'D) I think it's crazy you not going in...y'got what looks like hypothermia and real bad frostbite. They could wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it treated. 
Warren sits in the chair next to Elmore and begins mimicking him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking three fingers away, waving a stump, belly-laughing... 
MARGIE (CONT'D) Warren! Now you go and practice your nunchucks now, leave us be for a bit Shug. 
Warren scowls, getting up, in super-slow motion, making sounds with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks-- Margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it-- 
Then, in a blur, Warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost hitting Elmore in the face. He bolts the room before Grandma can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts... 
MARGIE (CONT'D) ...M'sorry about that boy, his momma abandoned him going on a year now, his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe Correctional facility-- got some "clarity" issues. He did some home invasion sodomy-torture type stuff, wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself consecutive life terms-- shipped off to Soledad there in California. (beat, scribbles something down) --reminds me, I got that care package I need to send off-- (beat, continues lament) Anyhoo, m'husband Bill took the coward's route, n'committed suicide by hangin' 'bout nine months back. Ever since then, little Boogie there's been the man'a the house! (beat, gnarled grin) And we make a darn cute couple I think! 
Margie, cackling again-- the facade of sanity showing serious signs of strain...Elmore pulls the ammo box across the table. Stenciled on the side: "177th Airborne Division -- Charlie Company - Reckon" He cracks the lid. 
MARGIE (CONT'D) I don't think that's been opened since my husband died. 
Inside, army memorabilia and bric-a-brac; patches, service- tags, dog-earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which make Margie horribly uncomfortable) Saigon bottled beer and most importantly, a .357 Colt Python. 
Elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the chamber-- it's loaded. He sifts some more, palms loose bullets at the bottom of the box. He cracks a blackened grin, rolling the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we... 
CUT TO: 
A padlock being locked and secured. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: 
INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY 
Elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely. Casino and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion. Craps players, pissed that their "hot streaks" have been cut short, harangue police and sheriff's personnel in passing. Barflys and blackjack habituates, accustomed to staying in one spot for months on end, have to be manually removed. 
The four call girls, trying to argue their way past security and onto one of the elevators, realizing they're not getting anywhere near the Penthouse level. Messner coordinates the Nomad's exodus, continually adjusting his earpiece, trying to contact Carruthers, two agents flank him. 
MESSNER (to agent) I want you to locate Agent Carruthers now. (beat, to another agent) The guests that aren't able to leave need to be confined to their suites. And under no circumstances are they to venture out, for any reason. Have the staff make calls to that effect. 
The pimply Casino Employee is at the center of an intensive on-spot interrogation being conducted by a group of agents. Messner arrives, stares at the kid. 
MESSNER (CONT'D) This him? 
FBI AGENT (nodding, then to kid) Alright Ricky, I want you to explain to Agent Messner exactly what happened and do it slowly please. 
The kid, head bobbing, gnawing fingernails, cuticles mangled. 
CASINO EMPLOYEE Yeah, ye-- I-- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut-- 
MESSNER --Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now? 
CASINO EMPLOYEE He uh-- he asked about-- I'm-- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent. 
MESSNER (quick, thrown) Wait a minute, what other agent? (beat, to others) What other agent? 
FBI AGENT I have no idea. It wasn't anybody from our office. 
CASINO EMPLOYEE He said he was from San Francisco. 
MESSNER Did he give you his name? 
CASINO EMPLOYEE Yeah, uh-- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh-- 
MESSNER (to other agents) --run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for-- 
CASINO EMPLOYEE --he was wearing one of our jackets. 
Messner stops cold. 
MESSNER Who? 
CASINO EMPLOYEE The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets... 
Messner turns, bores in on the kid, no more bullshit now. 
MESSNER This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent? 
CASINO EMPLOYEE Uh, yeah. 
MESSNER You're sure? 
CASINO EMPLOYEE Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it. 
MESSNER And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets-- 
CASINO EMPLOYEE Yeah.

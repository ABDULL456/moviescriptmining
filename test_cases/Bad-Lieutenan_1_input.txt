POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that create the mescarole canyon of the STREET. 
LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own terror. 
Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears -- 
A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness. 
It is almost as loud as the "SHOT". 
BRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire up the ass! 
LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE! 
ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly. 
Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED. 
BRASH FEMALE VOICE (OC) Fuck you. 
LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He cannot be relieved. The terror is with him. 
CUT TO: 
INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT 
LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately pulls the DRAPES. 
LT Someone just took a shot at me... 
Ariane laughs. 
ARIANE Sure, baby Sure And you don't do cocaine, either. 
LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him. 
LT It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me. (beat) You gotta believe me! 
ARIANE (shrugs) Why? 
ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT. 
LT Just kick back, baby. Make yourself at home. (suddenly pissed) But of course it won't be nobody's home, if you don't come through with the fucking rent! 
LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY under it. 
LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky Mob joint answers.

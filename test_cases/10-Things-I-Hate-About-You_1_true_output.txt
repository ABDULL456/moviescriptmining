PATRICK You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission. 
She turns to look at him. 
KAT Oh, so now you think you know me? 
PATRICK I'm gettin' there 
Her voice loses it's venom 
KAT The only thing people know about me is that I'm "scary". 
He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary right now.  He tries to hide his smile. 
PATRICK 
Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself. 
They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they're both created the same exterior for themselves. 
Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He looks up at her house. 
PATRICK (continuing) So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass? 
KAT He just wants me to be someone I'm not. 
PATRICK Who? 
KAT BIANCA 
PATRICK No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ... 
Kat stares at him with new admiration. 
KAT You know -- you're not as vile as I thought you were. 
She leans drunkenly toward him. 
Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then Patrick turns away 
PATRICK So, I'll see you in school 
Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, SLAMMING the door shut behind her. 
CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT 
Bianca and Cameron ride in silence. He finally breaks it. 
CAMERON I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied". 
BIANCA (faux-innocence ) I was? 
CAMERON You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you? 
Bianca bites her lip. 
BIANCA (reluctant) Well, no... 
CAMERON Then that's all you had to say. 
BIANCA But 
CAMERON You always been this selfish? 
BIANCA thinks a minute 
He pulls up in front of the house 
CAMERON Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter. 
She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word. 
Cameron grins and drives away 
CAMERON (continuing) And I'm back in the saddle. 
INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the others enter.  The White Rastas are first. 
DEREK Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of my heart. 
He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away. 
CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found friendliness. 
CLEM Yippe kai-aye, bra. (to Kat) Dance for me, cowgirl. 
He sits next to Derek

MARCUS You think they'll buy that? 
BLAIR Worth a shot. (looking at him) Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live. 
THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to: 
EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT 
THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles, coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS. 
THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the LAUNCH TUBE. 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT 
THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead. 
BLAIR They're already here for you-- 
MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from the chains. 
BLAIR (cont'd) Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country-- 
MARCUS I'm heading across the river. 
BLAIR No human being can survive there-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS I'm not human, remember? 
BLAIR You're gonna try and save those kids. 
MARCUS It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense... 
BLAIR Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already-- 
MARCUS For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead. 
BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following. 
BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door-- 
BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again. 
BLAIR Damn it, we're too late-- 
MARCUS Where's that go? 
MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit. It's not running, but there's no way to get through it. 
BLAIR Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan-- 
MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it backwards, has no idea how to shoot it-- 
BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself, takes aim and FIRES-- 
KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN. 
INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run, the soldiers readying their weapons. 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT 
MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus. 
BLAIR Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance. 
She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device-- 
--then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's startled-- it felt very human. 
MARCUS Thank you. 
MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from the hole and pulls himself upward as-- 
THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS-- 
BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the CONCRETE-- 
--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the ventilation shaft-- 
INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT

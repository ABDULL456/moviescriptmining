JEFFREY You think you can remove the grill but you can't.  It's welded. 
COLE checks the grill anyway. 
JEFFREY See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are locked, too.  They're protecting the people on the outside from us.  But the people outside are as crazy as us. 
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight. 
ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep. 
The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close. 
For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off. 
JEFFREY You know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is "majority rules".  Take germs for example. 
Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"! 
COLE Germs?! 
JEFFREY In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"! 
As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER. 
JEFFREY (cont.) So cut to the 20th century!  Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole.  I order a burger in this fast food joint.  The waiter drops it on the floor.  He picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me...like it was all okay. 
No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on... 
JEFFREY "What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you? 
COLE I'm not crazy. 
JEFFREY Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out? 
COLE If you know how to escape, why don't you...? 
JEFFREY Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word. 
COLE What's that mean? 
JEFFREY I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS... 
PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself. 
JEFFREY Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little agitated.  The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING... 
COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away. 
JEFFREY You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient! I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you morons find out who I am.  My father's gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES! MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER. 
INT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING 
ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached to his tiny, restrained body. 
ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen. 
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Torture!  Experiments!  We're all monkeys 
COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes the seat next to him. 
COLE They hurt you! 
JEFFREY Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty. 
ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles, eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates. 
TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.) These video tapes were obtained by animal rights activists who worked underground as laboratory assistants for several months.  Authorities say there is little they can do until... 
The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of their experiments passively. 
ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily. 
COLE Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out! 
JEFFREY (startled, turning) Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. (sudden whisper) I didn't say a word about "you know what". 
COLE What are you talking about??? 
JEFFREY You know -- your plan. 
As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine. 
JEFFREY What're you writing?  You a reporter? 
COLE (shielding the magazine) It's private. 
JEFFREY A lawsuit?  You going to sue them? 
Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills. 
BILLINGS Yo, James -- time to take your meds. 
INT.  DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING) 
ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...

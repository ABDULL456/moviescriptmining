DAN WHITE (CONT'D) Why are you turning on me like this at the last minute? What did I do? 
HARVEY MILK I didn't have all the details. I'll help you craft a different version that doesn't displace any kids. 
DAN WHITE Harvey, I can't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this. Don't do this. 
HARVEY MILK I'm getting a lot of pressure, Dan. 
DAN WHITE You strung me along. And now you're throwing me to the wolves. 
HARVEY MILK You only need one more vote, Dan. There are 5 other Supervisors you could convince besides me. Dan grabs Harvey. It's threatening. A new side of Dan. 
DAN WHITE I'll vote against your Queer Law. I'll get Quentin against it. 
HARVEY MILK It'll still pass. You can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan. 
DAN WHITE I gave you a chance, Harvey. I really did. You blew it. You really blew it. Dan goes, the rage of a scorned adolescent under his suit. 
94A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT 
Harvey's mood has darkened as he talks into his recorder... 
HARVEY MILK Across the country, a handful of city councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people against discrimination. But Anita Bryant and her right wing Christian fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash. Now she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances. While we were preparing for the battle against Briggs and Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking her show on the road... sweeping the country. Her next stop was Wichita, Kansas. 
95 INT. TV NEWS REPORTS - NIGHT 
CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays." Anita talks to a REPORTER. BRIGGS is among the supporters at her side. 
ANITA BRYANT I give thanks for all of our foot soldiers of God here in Wichita. But we must push on. Look what happened to Sodom and to the world of Noah. Onward Christian soldiers! 
(MORE) 
ANITA BRYANT (CONT'D) (lifting her hand with 
BRIGGS'S) On to California! 
96 I/E. TELEPHONE TREE MONTAGE / EFFECT - DAY A telephone tree MONTAGE starts with Cleve on a PAY PHONE on Castro Street: 
CLEVE JONES Hi. We're losing Wichita. Rally tonight. Sundown. Market and Castro. A MULTIPLYING FRAME EFFECT: the person he called calls two others, they call four, then more and more as the tree grows. 
98 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT 
HARVEY'S POV ON: The VIOLENT DEATH THREAT LETTER AND DRAWING that is still tacked up to his refrigerator. OUTSIDE: The SOUNDS of a RIOT in the making. Harvey rips down the threatening LETTER and throws it away. 
99 INT. CAMERA SHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Harvey BOUNDS down the stairs and into the shop. Cleve RUSHES into the store, breathless. 
CLEVE JONES They're moving. I don't know where, but... 
HARVEY MILK Did Jim call the press? (shouting at Danny) Get out there with your camera! 
DANNY NICCOLETTA I'm going! 
CLEVE JONES Press is covered. But we don't have a permit to march. 
HARVEY MILK (digs for his bullhorn) When I got Coors out of the bars, the Union gave me this. I want you to have it. 
CLEVE JONES What do I do with this?

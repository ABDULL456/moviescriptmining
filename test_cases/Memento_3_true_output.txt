NATALIE What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well - 
Leonard is getting frustrated. 
LEONARD Neither do I. 
NATALIE Don't protect him. 
LEONARD I'm not. 
NATALIE Help me. 
LEONARD How? 
NATALIE Get rid of Dodd for me. 
LEONARD What? 
NATALIE Kill him. I'll pay you. 
LEONARD What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money. 
NATALIE What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right? 
LEONARD That's different. 
(CONTINUED) 
123  CONTINUED: (2)							  123 
NATALIE Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her! 
LEONARD Don't talk about my wife. 
NATALIE I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends! 
Leonard stands up. 
LEONARD Calm down. 
NATALIE That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot! 
LEONARD Just take it easy, this isn't my fault. 
NATALIE Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?! 
Leonard steps towards her. 
LEONARD Yes. 
NATALIE You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard. 
LEONARD Shut the fuck up! 
Natalie gets right in his face, grinning. 
NATALIE I'm gonna use you, you stupid fuck. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak.

Leonard grabs his Polaroids and finds one of Natalie. He reaches into his pocket for a pen, but cannot find one. 
NATALIE (cont'd) Lost your pen? That's too bad, freak. Otherwise you could've written yourself a little note about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts. 
Leonard moves around the room searching for a pen. Natalie follows him, speaking into his ear. 
NATALIE (cont'd) No pens here, I'm afraid. You're never going to know that I called you a retard, and your wife a whore. 
Leonard turns to face her, barely controlling his anger. 
LEONARD Don't say another fucking word! 
NATALIE About your whore of a wife? 
Leonard slaps Natalie. She smiles, then speaks softly. 
NATALIE (cont'd) I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is? 
Leonard fumes. 
NATALIE (cont'd) Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard. 
Leonard turns away, body tensed, ready to snap. Natalie reaches out to gently brush the hair above his ear with her fingers. 
NATALIE (cont'd) You sad freak, you won't remember any of what I've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers. 
Leonard spins around, BACKHANDING Natalie on the cheek. 
He PUNCHES her in the mouth then pushes her to the floor. He stands over her, furious with himself as much as her.

Natalie gets to her feet, and goes to the door. She turns to Leonard. Her face is bloody but she smiles. 
NATALIE (cont'd) See you soon. 
Natalie exits. Leonard watches her walk out to her car and get in. She just sits there. 
Leonard turns from the window and looks around the room. He grabs at drawers, searching for a pen. He looks back out the    * window. Natalie is still sitting in her car. Leonard is	    * sifting through the papers on the desk when he hears a car	 * door SLAM. He looks out of the window to see Natalie getting    * out of her car. She turns to walk toward the house. Her face is swollen and bloody. 
Leonard opens the door for her. 
LEONARD What happened? 
Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her purse. 
NATALIE What does it look like?

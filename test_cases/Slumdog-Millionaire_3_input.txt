1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1 
An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes. Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other side. 
JAVED O/S Salim! Salim! 
2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2 
Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light, shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice announces. 
TALKBACK V/O Ten to white-out, nine, eight, seven... 
PREM Are you ready? 
Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly. 
PREM (CONT'D) I said are you ready? 
JAMAL Yes. 
3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3 
The thumping at the door continues. The sound of mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the chamber, snaps the chamber shut. 
TALKBACK V/O ...three, two, one, zero. Cue Prem, cue applause... 
Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through. A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly... 
4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4 
...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing into rapturous applause. 
(CONTINUED) 
4   CONTINUED:                                                       4 
TALKBACK V/O Go, Prem. 
A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage. Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem Kumar. 
PREM Welcome to Who Wants To Be A Millionaire! 
More applause. 
PREM (CONT'D) Please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night- a local from our very own Mumbai! 
Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing. 
PREM (CONT'D) Smile, dammit. 
The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him ferociously across the face. Then again and again. Blood trickles from his mouth. 
5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5 
The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung from the ceiling by his arms. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS Your name, bhen chod. 
Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the lights. 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D) Your name! 
JAMAL Jamal Malik. 
And seamlessly we are back.... 
6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6 
...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem leans back in his chair, a man at home in his surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen. 
PREM So, Jamal, tell us a bit about yourself. 
Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved under water. 
7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7 
We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes. 
JAMAL V/O I work in a call centre. In Juhu. 
8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8 
PREM A Phone-basher! And what type of call centre would this be? 
JAMAL XL 5. Mobile phones. 
PREM Aha! So, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with Special Offers, huh? 
JAMAL No, actually, I'm an assistant.

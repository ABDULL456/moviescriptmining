MARTIN No, I don't have one. 
MARY You don't have a headache. I have a headache. 
Mary leans in close, smiling. 
MARY We had a good laugh, didn't we? 
MARTIN Yeah. I guess we did. 
EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY 
As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to it. 
MARY Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back. 
MARTIN I think I'll go see Debi today. 
MARY Of course you will. 
MARTIN I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her. 
MARY Take care of her. She's a keeper. 
MARTIN Yeah... 
MARY And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange? 
MARTIN I have always thought about her and missed her. 
A nurse approaches with a wheelchair. 
MARY Separate the wheat from the chaff and you've got the candle cat. 
Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes at Martin, taking him in. 
MARY Remember no matter how impossible your problems feel. I've known people without a chance in the world. And all of a sudden, they have lives. Time allows miracles. Let yourself breathe, son. 
Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once more to connect. 
MARTIN Mom... 
The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel Merman, arms out Broadway style. 
MARY "What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ We really mean it!" 
Mary stops short, and squints at Martin. 
MARY Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's your name? 
EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY 
Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave... 
MARTIN Hey Pop... You got off easy. The house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho- pharmacological punching bag and I murder for cash. If you were here I think you'd be proud. 
He drives off. 
INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY 
The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs the steel-sided briefcase. 
MARTIN pries out a wall vent, slides in the case and replaces the vent. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself... 
MCCULLERS "...Against the wind... just a young man running... Against the wind... let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on it the thuuunder! Night moves..." 
McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. He nudges Lardner, and points.

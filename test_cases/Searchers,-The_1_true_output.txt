LAURIE I'm a woman, Martie... (he tries to say something but she goes right on) We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives... When you're little we even wash you... How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know... 
MARTIN You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid... 
LAURIE Wouldn't bother me... (she heads for the door) I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you... 
And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her. 
INT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT 
It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the good plain Swedish modern of today. 
There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told, a cheerful, warm-smelling room. 
Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait, listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near the mantel. 
ETHAN ...an' then it snowed and we lost the trail... No need to tell ya all the places we went... Fort Richardson, Fort Wingate an' Cobb... the Anadarko Agency... Trouble is we don't even know which band that war party belonged to... 
Mrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning. 
MRS. JORGENSEN Well, you did all a body could, Ethan. 
ETHAN I got your boy killed. 
MRS. JORGENSEN (gently) Don't go blamin' yourself... 
JORGENSEN (angrily) It's this country killed my boy!... Yes, by golly! 
Mrs. Jorgensen stands. 
MRS. JORGENSEN Now Lars!... It so happens we be Texicans... We took a reachin' hold, way far out, past where any man has right or reason to hold on... Or if we didn't, our folks did... So we can't leave off without makin' them out to be fools, wastin' their lives 'n wasted in the way they died... A Texican's nothin' but a human man out on a limb... This year an' next and maybe for a hundred more.  But I don't think it'll be forever.  Someday this country will be a fine good place to be... Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come... 
The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't heard a word of it. 
LAURIE Ma!... Martie's drawers is a sight! Ain't fit for rags!... Would it be all right if we gave him some of Brad's things? 
There is just the briefest hesitation... 
MRS. JORGENSEN Why...'course it would! They're in the chest... 
And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a big chest at the far end of the room. 
JORGENSEN (rising excitedly) By golly, the letter... In the chest, mama... It came for you, Ethan... last winter... 
Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths. 
JORGENSEN (continuing) Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought it... 
Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two- inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and looks at the snip of cloth. 
ETHAN (quietly) Mrs. Jorgensen... 
She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and 
Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long- handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes, etc. 
ETHAN Will you look at this? 
He holds out the snip of calico. 
MRS. JORGENSEN Why it's just a snip of calico... 
ETHAN You ever see it before... like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore? 
MRS. JORGENSEN Yes!... Yes, I remember!... Have they found her, Ethan? 
ETHAN No... not yet... 
He takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and carefully pockets it. He looks broodingly into the fire. 
ETHAN (continuing) ...not yet... 
Laurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes. 
INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT 
Martin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket. 
He glares up as Laurie enters. His feet are in his boots. 
MARTIN Might at least have left me my pants! 
LAURIE Shush!... Time for bed anyway... (putting clothes near him) Likely these'll need some takin' in... Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and... 
JORGENSEN'S VOICE (calling) Laurie!... Come... come! 
Ethan opens the door, enters. 
LAURIE Yes, Pa!... Good night, Martie... good night, Mr. Edwards... 
She wants to kiss Martie but is shy in Ethan's presence and hurries out. 
MARTIN Good night... Laurie... 
ETHAN Good night... 
Martin stoops to remove his boots. Ethan studies him and looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin. 
He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively. 
He starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk.

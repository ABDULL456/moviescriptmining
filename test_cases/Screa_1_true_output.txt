MAN I only eat popcorn at the movies. 
CASEY I'm getting ready to watch a video. 
MAN Really? What? 
CASEY Just some scary movie. 
MAN Do you like scary movies? 
CASEY Uh-huh. 
MAN What's your favorite scary movie? 
He's flirting with her.  Casey moves away from the stove and takes a seat at the kitchen counter, directly in front of the glass door. 
CASEY I don't know. 
MAN You have to have a favorite. 
Casey thinks for second. 
CASEY Uh...HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? 
MAN Guess. 
CASEY Uh...NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. 
MAN Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers? 
CASEY Yeah...Freddy Krueger. 
MAN Freddy-that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary. 
CASEY The first one was, but the rest sucked. 
MAN So, you gotta boyfriend? 
CASEY (giggling) Why? You wanna ask me out? 
MAN Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? 
CASEY No. 
MAN You never told me your name. 
Casey smiles, twirling her hair. 
CASEY Why do you want to know my name? 
MAN Because I want to know who I'm looking at. 
Casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door. 
CASEY What did you say? 
MAN I want to now who I'm talking to. 
CASEY That's not what you said. 
MAN What do you think I said? 
Casey CLICKS on the outside light.  A flood light illuminates the backyard.  Her eyes survey the grounds.  But it's empty.  No one's there.  She turns the light out. 
On the stove, the popcorn POPS. 
CASEY I have to go now. 
MAN Wait...I thought we were gonna go out. 
CASEY Nah, I don't think so... 
MAN Don't hang up on me. 
CASEY Gotta go. 
MAN Don't... 
CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  She checks the glass door making sure it's locked and then moves to the stove as... 
THE PHONE RINGS. 
She slides the popcorn from the stove, reaching for the phone. 
CASEY Yes? 
MAN I told you not to hang up on me. 
CASEY What do you want? 
MAN To talk.

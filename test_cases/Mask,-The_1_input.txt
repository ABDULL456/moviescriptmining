INT. KITCHEN 
The Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way into the kitchen. 
C.U. - FOOT 
He steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right out from under him. SLAM. 
THUG'S P.O.V. 
as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed. 
THUG Whoaaaaa! 
Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG. 
STANLEY 
plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the casino. 
INT. CASINO 
Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party-goers. 
STANLEY Pssst. You guys. Over here. 
Charlie turns around. 
CHARLIE Stanley! What are you doing here? 
He motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun. 
STANLEY Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil. 
Stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - POLICE CAR 
Milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens. He scurries off towards the casino. 
INT. CASINO 
The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one OF the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes. 
SWEDE Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag! 
Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and casually begins to juggle them. 
DORIAN/MASK Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to grind with you. In fact I got a couple and I'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache! 
He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax. 
DORIAN/MASK (CONT.) Round and round she goes. Who dies first, nobody knows! 
ANGLE ON THE VIKING SHIP 
Stanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina. 
TINA Stanley! 
STANLEY Hang on, Tina. 
TINA Stanley, look out! 
Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right next to him in half. 
Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat. 
Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. 
Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he extends his slimy tongue. 
C.U. - TONGUE 
The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle. 
Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking shield and protects Tina and himself. 
Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley. 
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. 
They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the impact. 
A HUGE GREEN CLAW 
drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place. 
DORIAN/MASK How touching! The two love birds. Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together. 
TINA You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody! 
DORIAN/MASK If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is.

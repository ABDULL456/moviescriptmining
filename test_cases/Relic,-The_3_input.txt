LARRY What is it? 
HENRY I don't know.  But I think it's bad. 
They keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as they back up, step by step.  Move in as their faces suddenly TWIST WITH FEAR.  THE BOYS... SCREAM BLOODY MURDER... The sound echoes in the darkness as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARGO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Margo sits up in the darkness, gasping.  Moonlight cuts across the bed. It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare.  She reaches for her light.  As she switches it on, we see a photo on her bedside table.  It shows a group on a mountain in TIBET.  There are several people with their arms slung around each other.  At the end is a younger MARGO holding hands with JOHN WHITTLESLEY.  They appear to be more than friends. 
ON MARGO... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light and lies back, alone in her bed. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY 
Yellow crime tape encircles the museum.  Dead leaves swirl in clusters and the sky is overcast.  Overnight, fall turned to winter.  The front of the museum is ringed with police cars.  Margo rides up on her bike and pauses, startled at the sight.  We watch as she crosses, has a few words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.  She wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up... 
A TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.  Out steps SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST. 
INT. LOWER ROTUNDA - DAY 
Margo enters.  The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved from the trunk of a single tree.  Inside it are mannequins of Northwest Coast Indians.  Milling around are at least twenty COPS.  One approaches. 
COP ID. 
Worried, Margo hands it over. 
MARGO What's going on? 
COP All employees are to go to the IMAX room for a briefing, Dr. Green. 
INT. SIDE HALL - MUSEUM - DAY 
Several cops go by with tracking dogs.  Margo looks back at the dogs, increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... 
HENRY AND LARRY.  Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with MRS. BEASLEY outside an office.  Margo exchanges a look with both boys, remembering them from yesterday.  A tentative smile starts but Henry and Larry don't return it.  Serious and chastened, they drop their eyes.  Margo continues on. 
TWO COPS stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned to Margo as she approaches. 
COP ONE What was that?  Six? 
COP TWO Lost count. 
Margo glances past them to see an OLDER MAN wearing the badge of a NIGHT WATCHMAN, leaning over a sink.  He wipes his mouth.  Margo's eyes move down to see... THE MAN'S SNEAKERS are soaked in blood. 
INT. HALL OF ADVANCED FOSSIL MAMMALS - DAY 
More cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans, monkeys, gorillas.  It's an odd sight.  They all look up with interest as in walks the imposing figure of... 
SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST.  He turns to a young eager beaver, OFFICER BAILEY, flashes his badge.  Bailey straightens to attention. 
PENDERGAST Could you please take me to the officer in charge? 
INT. CIRCULAR STAIRWELL - DAY 
Pendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum.  The hall below them is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb.  The stairway opens onto a maze-like set of rooms in the basement.  Everything around them is STREAKED and SPATTERED in BLOOD.  There are trails of it on the floor, the walls, the overhead light. 
Several COPS stand guard as DETECTIVE VINCE D'AGOSTA goes over the area.  He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of authority.  A modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep disguise.  He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt.  His t-shirt is plainly visible underneath.  On his worn plastic belt is a badge. 
D'AGOSTA Don't touch anything until the S.O.C.  has finished with those stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the perimeter.  I don't want any contamination.  There's an incredible amount of blood evidence down here. We need more light.  Where's the photographer?  Tell him to quit eating donuts, I need him. 
As Pendergast enters, D'Agosta looks up at this serious African- American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie. 
D'AGOSTA Who are you?  The undertaker? 
PENDERGAST Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. 
D'AGOSTA Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out? 
PENDERGAST Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help. 
The two men shake hands.  They couldn't be more different.  Pendergast is an elegant intellectual... D'Agosta a working class spark plug who operates from the gut.  Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground. 
PENDERGAST The body?

CREDITS OVER: a magical fairy tale world in collage - images of fantastic creatures striped and spotted, hoofed and horned. 
Goats and warthogs mingle in an open field; a baby giraffe tries to reach leaves over a fence; rhinos roll happily in rich red mud, looking like giant muddy boulders, while nearby, black and white Malayan tapirs cool themselves in watering holes. 
Exotic monkeys with comical faces cling lovingly to one another, swing from trees, climb over one another, prance and screech; a probiscus monkey with a 'Jimmy Durante' nose pointing out through the plane of the screen. Flamingoes strut about in the aviary, their pink feathers reflected in the water. 
A sloth droops lazily from a tree branch, unfazed, while a nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like Tinkerbell... 
... the Pondicherry zoo is a children's paradise nestled in a botanical garden. 
WRITER (V.O.) You were raised in a zoo? 
3   EXT. PONDICHERRY ZOO, INDIA, 1961 - DAY                      3 
There's a flurry of activity in the animal clinic behind a monitor lizard that wanders the main path. ZOO WORKERS gather in the doorway, talking excitedly. 
No one notices the lizard. 
ADULT PI (V.O.) Born and raised in Pondicherry, in what was the French part of India. My father owned the zoo, and I was delivered on short notice by a herpetologist who was there to check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard. 
The zoo owner (FATHER - late 20s) hurries down the path as quickly as his heavy leg brace will allow and hurries into the animal clinic. 
ADULT PI (V.O.) Mother and I were both healthy... 
The lizard crawls away. 
ADULT PI (V.O.) but the poor lizard escaped and was trampled by a frightened cassowary...

A modest row house. There is a French influence to the decor, along with books and artwork that celebrate the spiritual.

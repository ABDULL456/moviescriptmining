OFF THE PATH... Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay, when... SHERYL LOOKS DOWN, SCREAMS! 
A BLOODY, MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP. The Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. The kill looks fresh. 
MIKE Fucking nasty. 
SHERYL What is it? 
MIKE Looks like it's a, or was, a fox. Come on. 
Mike and Sheryl head back to the path. 
ANGLE ON - The MUTILATED, BLOODY FOX. 
21A   EXT.   BRIDGE ON BASE TRAIL   - DAY                         21A 
Mike and Sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge. 
22    EXT.   BASE TRAIL #2 - DAY                                  22 
Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing. There are a number of signs pointing toward different trails. (Donner Trail, Willow Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc.) 
Sheryl grabs the map and some water. Mike swigs some water, munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook. 
SHERYL What do you think?    "Cannibal" Trail or the other one? 
MIKE Guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views. 
SHERYL We're not Lewis and/or Clark. We're gonna stick to one of the ones the Ranger said. 
IDA (OS) You folks need some help? 
IDA FOSTER, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon. She is worn, haggard, but has a friendly, smile. She wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots. 
MIKE We're just going over our options here. 
IDA Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong. 
SHERYL The Ranger at base suggested Donner Trail or... 
IDA ...Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam only knows those two trails. Well. Between those, I'd pick Donner Trail. Willow Creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see. Donner weaves through Peddler's Point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view. 
SHERYL (To Mike) What do you think? 
Then, she notices a ring on Sheryl's finger. 
IDA That's a pretty ring. 
SHERYL Thank you. 
IDA Not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the Lord's eyes. How long have you two been wed? 
Sheryl and Mike trade looks. 
SHERYL Oh... we're not married.    Not yet anyway. 
Mike shoots her a look: "not yet?" 
SHERYL It's a ring my father gave me for graduation. 
IDA (embarrassed) Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like you was married is'all. Both so beautiful. (Beat) I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird. I need to mind my own business. 
SHERYL No, it's fine. 
MIKE (changing topics) Which one of those trails got the best clearings? 
IDA Clearings? Neither will give you much in the way of clearings. But, there's another path, this one here. (Points to the map) Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see. 
MIKE Sounds perfect. (To Sheryl) Yeah? 
IDA Well, I'll leave you to it. Last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private time. 
SHERYL                           MIKE Thank you.                        Yeah, thanks for the tip. 
Ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away. 
IDA I'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry... I bet the Lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child. Good luck and God bless you both. 
Sheryl and Mike don't know how to respond.      Ida leaves.   Once out of earshot... 
SHERYL I suddenly feel the need for confession. 
MIKE (Still lingering on...) Not yet? Love taking your shots, don't ya? 
Sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: LOPEZ shoots the bird upwards, but-- 
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - DUSK 
STRICKLAND raises the device to track Lopez and hits the button-- we see the RED DIODES GLOW and-- 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
--LOPEZ is hit, his EYES FRAGMENT, shards of GLASS fly. GREER is close enough to get a partial hit, crouches in agony. SFX, an awful SCREAMING NOISE inside his head-- 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - DUSK 
SCREAMING NOISE CONTINUES as REAL GREER spasms in pain in his stim-chair, in the sensory projector's RED LIGHT. 
EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - DUSK 
THE CHOPPER, pilotless and out of control, heads over the chain link fence. Beyond are vacant lots, with tents and makeshift hovels, small buildings. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
GREER regains his senses, just in time to see-- THE CHOPPER careening down toward the Dread encampment. 
EXT. RESERVATION NO MAN'S LAND - NIGHT 
THE CHOPPER CRASHES on its skids, at an angle, amidst LEAN-TOs and TENTS-- GREER is thrown out his side with the impact. 
THE CHOPPER'S ENGINE EXPLODES. THE WHIRRING TAIL ROTOR comes right at him and CHOPS OFF his left arm at the elbow, BURNING FUEL spreads and IGNITES his back. Lucky thing he's a surrogate. Less fortunate DREADS run screaming, we hear the CRIES OF WOUNDED. GREER lies in the dirt, in flames, motionless. Then his eyes BLINK and move, taking in the sight of-- STRICKLAND, illuminated by the FIRE, horrified at the carnage. He's starting to move away from the wreck. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: With supreme effort, GREER gets to his feet, still partly IN FLAMES. His stump of an arm SPARKS and leaks HYDRAULIC FLUID. He reacts at the sight of-- A CORPSE on the ground, an older man crushed by a hunk of DEBRIS from the chopper. But it's not the corpse that interests him-- his DART RIFLE lies nearby, thrown from the chopper during the crash. GREER grabs it in his right hand. He pushes past DREADS who move to help their injured fellows, PANIC in the fire- lit no man's land. He spots-- STRICKLAND, running into the distance. Greer supports the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and FIRES-- STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot knocks him off his feet. GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at him angrily. STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER stands over him, lets the rifle dangle. Strickland has some trouble speaking. 
STRICKLAND Oh my G-god-- why? What do you people want from me?! 
GREER You're a killer-- 
STRICKLAND They were just surries! Goddamn machines! 
GREER 
(A BEAT) You really don't know? BLAM! A DOUBLE-BARRELED SHOTGUN BLAST throws GREER backward, away from STRICKLAND. The DART RIFLE flies from his grasp. A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun. She gets between Greer and Strickland, who manages to crawl away, vanishing behind other DREADS who are gathering around Greer. 
GREER (CONT'D) Strickland! Wait! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Greer tries to get up, a HOLE has been blown in his chest, exposing SPARKING WIRES and ELECTRONICS, spraying GREEN COOLANT. He's lost control of his legs, which crumple beneath him, he falls to his knees. He's surrounded now by angry, disenfranchised DREADS, all of whom regard him with hatred. THE FEMALE DREAD ejects the used cartridges and reloads the shotgun. GREER stares at her coldly. 
GREER (CONT'D) I'm a federal agent-- 
FEMALE DREAD You're an abomination. THE WOMAN pumps the shotgun again points it a Greer's head. Just as it GOES OFF-- 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT 
GREER lurches out of his chair, yanking the SENSORY PROJECTOR off his head-- the RED LIGHT switches to WHITE. He stumbles out of the room into the hall. 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT 
GREER bangs on the door to Maggie's bedroom, rattles the knob. A RED GLOW from beneath her door. 
GREER Maggie! Wake up! He's clearly in pain, clutches his temples. BLOOD begins to gush from his nose. Greer slides down against the door, unable to stand. 
INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
THE DOOR rattles, we hear GREER calling:

JESSE You tell him I'll come by. 
CATFISH (no longer smiling) That's good. I'll see you real soon then. 
As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE. 
PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long lens camera, triggers snapshots. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons. 
Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element. 
BUD Hey, Mike. 
BRADDOCK Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch. He's down from Washington. With the Attorney General. 
FITCH Martin. Just call me Martin. 
Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes. 
BRADDOCK Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor. 
BUD How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch? 
FITCH Just over a year. 
Bud looks at Braddock. 
FITCH I want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential. 
BUD Is that right... 
Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down. 
BRADDOCK Why don't we get to the particulars? 
FITCH Right. Alright. (clears throat) To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. A bait. In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement... We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... Which target do we go after first. We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand? 
BUD No. 
FITCH Well, exposing bodies has limitations. Those people are dead. We can't retrieve their lives. 
Bud blinks. 
BRADDOCK He means there might not be enough to back Jesse. 
BUD Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead. 
FITCH What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads. He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. If Jesse can't offer something continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of much help. 
Bud stares at Fitch. 
A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 
WAITRESS Ready to order? 
FITCH (cuts in) Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort on the side. 
WAITRESS You'll take what? 
FITCH (curt) It's a dressing. 
WAITRESS Well...we got ranch, thousand island and oil. Which one you want? 
Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch: 
BUD Lost my appetite. 
And walks out. 
EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY 
Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They say nothing till they reach the car. 
BUD I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him. 
BRADDOCK What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's not your partner, Bud. This case is beyond our capacity. It requires resources we don't have. 
Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof. 
BUD They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?! 
BRADDOCK You're God damn right I do! You're out on a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job to make sure you get back! 
BUD This is bullshit. 
BRADDOCK That may be. What it ain't, is open for discussion. 
Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car. 
INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING 
A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth. 
JESSE Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I could tell y'all things. Names. Locations. What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get cut up and why. ...But what I got to know is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is, you need me. You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be. (pause) Y'all need me... I got the devil's address. 
REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

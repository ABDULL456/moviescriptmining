TOM It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know? 
PAUL No. 
TOM So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that. 
His friends say nothing. 
TOM (BEAT) Fuck! 
And with that he storms off. 
MCKENZIE Tom! 
PAUL Let him go. 
ANGLE ON Tom walking away from them. 
Literally, his entire universe falls apart. 
FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing. 
CUT TO: 
BLACK. 
And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA." 
CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old, Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a cult? 
We are: 
INT BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Tom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah. Tom and his family have formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and some others. 
CUT TO: 
LATER. Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone. 
RACHEL Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight! 
ANGLE ON TOM sitting with his mom Sarah at the table. They clap. Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong. Tom catches her looking. 
CUT TO: 
LATER. Tom being accosted by two more Aunts. 
AUNT ANITA I can't believe that. No girlfriend? 
TOM I can't believe it either! 
AUNT BETSY What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for? 
TOM The right girl I guess. 
AUNT BETSY There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick. 
TOM Oh you'd be surprised. 
AUNT ANITA (actually squeezing his CHEEKS) Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind? 
AUNT BETSY My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here -- 
TOM Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was. 
AUNT ANITA Oh I'm sorry. When was that? 
TOM July. 
AUNT BETSY You mean...seven months ago? 
AUNT ANITA Was it a man? 
TOM What? 
AUNT BETSY She's means `are you a homosexual?' 
TOM No. Where's that coming from? 
AUNT BETSY We just always wondered. 
Awkward.

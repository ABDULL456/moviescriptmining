MITCHELL Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you? 
REVIE Being very, very honest, I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't call him Clough because I won't take him down like that.. 
CLOUGH Thank you.

REVIE ...I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have. 
CLOUGH How did I do that, Don? 
REVIE Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were. 
CLOUGH Well, you WERE dirty, Don! 
REVIE That's not true. The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football. 
CLOUGH And before that, you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division. 
MITCHELL And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be relegated. 
CLOUGH And I was right. 
MITCHELL Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them? 
REVIE Of course it did! The things he said? Why, man? Why did you take the job in the first place? 
CLOUGH Because I thought it was the best job in the country. 
REVIE Of course it was the best job in the country. 
CLOUGH I was taking over the League Champions. (CO NTINU ED)

REVIE You were. You were taking over the best bunch of players you'd ever seen.

CLOUGH And I fancied winning the league, and winning Europe, and doing it better than you. 
REVIE There's no way you COULD win it better. 
CLOUGH But that's the only hope I've got. 
REVIE I only lost four matches.. 
CLOUGH Well, I can only lose three. 
REVIE No, no, no, no. CLOUGH And still play attractive, clean football. Without cheating! 
REVIE See, there he goes again.. 
MITCHELL Listening to you, I am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. It's more than that. It's personal. Am I right? 
CLOUGH Well, we're very different people, Don and I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I'm a warm man. An idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is different. There's a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware of it. But he's a cold person. 
REVIE You don't KNOW me!

CLOUGH And that lack of warmth. That coldness was there. Permeated the club when I arrived. 
REVIE I totally refute that. The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents. Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them? 
CLOUGH They would never have let me. 
REVIE Did you try? You didn't even try. I soaped those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me. 
CLOUGH Well are you surprised? What else was I going to do?? After what you did...

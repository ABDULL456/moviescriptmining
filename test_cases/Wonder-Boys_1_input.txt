...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back. 
SARA Grady, what are you doing, you idiot? 
GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face. 
GRADY Looking for you. 
He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS... 
faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH upward until we see that she is... 
KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue. 
121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW fall outside. 
The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. His NAMETAG says GREENHUT. 
GRADY I passed out. 
GREENHUT You did. 
GRADY I've been doing that a lot lately. 
GREENHUT So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand. 
GRADY Do you think that's why I've been having these... (grabbing James' term) ... spells? 
GREENHUT How long have you been having them? 
GRADY The last month maybe. 
GREENHUT How long have you been smoking marijuana? 
GRADY Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe. 
GREENHUT That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently? 
GRADY I've been trying to finish a book... 
GREENHUT And your wife left you. 
GRADY Is that in my chart? 
GREENHUT I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did. 
GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this statement 
GRADY I know. 
GREENHUT (tapping the glucose bottle) You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well. 
GRADY She told you about. . . 
GREENHUT Her dog, yes. 
GRADY Actually, it was her husband's dog... 
Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the first time, and GRADY stops. 
GREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. 
GRADY They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing. 
GREENHUT Better luck next time. 
GRADY So is my friend...is Sara still here? 
GREENHUT No. There's no one here. 
GRADY I have to see her. As soon as possible. 
Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch. 
GREENHUT Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and I want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. All right? 
122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON 
GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another. 
GRADY I wonder if you could show me something. 
123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER 
GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple and crazy with veins. 
GRADY Are these the only ones you have? 
The nurse's eyes crinkle.

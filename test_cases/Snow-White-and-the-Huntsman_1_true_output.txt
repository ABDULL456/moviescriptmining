QUEEN You possess a rare beauty, my love. In here. (She touches Snow white's heart) Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need its strength to one day become Queen. 
8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8 
Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and offers it to Snow White. He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding. Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the tree and they fall to the ground. And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father, DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony. 
KING MAGNUS My daughter will need your son's friendship more than ever, Duke Hammond. As will I yours. 
DUKE HAMMOND We are here to serve you, your Majesty. As the King watches his daughter, ERIC'S VOICEOVER resumes: 
ERIC (V.0) The next winter was the harshest in memory and Snow White's mother passed away. Ba EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken. A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move aside. 
ERIC (V.0) A year went by but the King was inconsolable. Taking advantage of his grief, dark forces gathered on the kingdom's borders.

10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10 
From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a clearing. At the head is -- King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at-- Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless warriors. King Magnus and the Duke trade a look - 
DUKE HAMMOND From what hell comes this army? 
KING MAGNUS A hell they'll soon revisit! King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to him. The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of the battlefield. When they meet -- Hand to hand combat at its most brutal. King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR 
SHATTERS LIKE GLASS. All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors shattering, evaporating. Strange. DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now that quiet. The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until all that is left in the field is -- 
ERIC (V.0.) The unholy army was defeated, leaving King Magnus with the spoils of victory. A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there. King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to look inside. 
(CONTINUED) 
10 CONTINUED: 10 Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil. King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters. 
KING MAGNUS You are now free. You have nothing to fear from me. Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the King kneels beside the terrified woman. 
KING MAGNUS What is your name, my lady? Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil. It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. 
RAVENNA My name is Ravenna, sire. The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel. 
ERIC (V.0.) So struck by her beauty was the King, that he forgot, for the first time, his broken heart. His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment. When she lifts her head -- 
CUT TO: 10a INT. GYPSY WAGON - FLASHBACK - DAY. l0a YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror. Ravenna as a child, beautiful but poor, looks into the mirror. Her MOTHER, a gypsy woman in tattered clothes, moves the mirror closer. 
RAVENNA'S MOTHER This - is all that can save you, Ravenna. The young Ravenna looks away, distracted by SHOUTS and COMMOTION outside. 10b EXT. GYPSY CAMP - SAME - DAY. 10b A little boy, FINN, runs as fast as he can through the snow toward the Gypsy Camp. Behind him, THE KING'S RIDERS advance on the camp. 
BACK INSIDE THE WAGON Ravenna's mother tries to keep her daughter's attention -- 
(CONTINUED) 
10b CONTINUED: 10b 
RAVENNA'S MOTHER Ravenna! 
11 INT. PREPARATION CHAMBER/ CASTLE - DAY. 11 
CU - RAVENNA'S FACE Present day. Still as a statue and even more beautiful as cheeks are powdered, eyebrows plucked and lips painted by several sets of HANDS. Her eyes stare straight ahead, unblinking, her mind elsewhere. Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the King. 
SNOW WHITE (O.S.) You're so beautiful... Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White, reverential, standing a few feet away. Ravenna's face softens as she looks at the face of Snow White. Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out her arm - "Come." As Snow White steps forward, the handmaidens withdraw until only one is left, weaving beautiful flowers in Ravenna's hair. 
RAVENNA That is kind, child. Especially when it is said that yours is the face of true beauty in this kingdom. Snow White doesn't quite know how to answer this. 
RAVENNA (A warm smile) Would you like to be dressed up like this and married one day? Snow White nods. 
RAVENNA I hope you'll invite me? 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE Of course. Snow White smiles, enchanted by her new friend. 
RAVENNA I know it is difficult, child. When I was your age I, too, lost my mother.

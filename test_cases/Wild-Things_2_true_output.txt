Kelly looks defiantly at the courtroom. 
KELLY No.  He raped me on the floor of his shitty house. 
CUT TO: 
WITNESS WAITING ROOM - SAME - SUZIE 
still pacing, as Ray and Gloria ENTER the room. 
Suzie shoots them a nervous glance, drops her cigarette, bends to pick it up, burns her fingers, drops it again.  She curses beneath her breath, wrapping her fingers about her shoulders. 
Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray. 
GLORIA You've got nothing to be scared of, Suzie, just take a deep breath. 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria. 
Hunter is on the witness stand. 
Suzie is in the box.  She looks pale, even more nervous. 
SUZIE He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt. 
HUNTER I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why? 
SUZIE Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp. 
Chuckling in the courtroom.  The JUDGE glares, silencing it. 
HUNTER Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you in your family's home on the 23rd of April last year? 
Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates. 
HUNTER (CONT'D) Ms. Toller? 
SUZIE I said he did. 
HUNTER Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you? 
Suzie looks around, as if for help.  The spectators stir. Ray rubs his eyes.  Gloria's are closed. 
SUZIE This wasn't my idea. 
HUNTER I'm sorry? 
Suzie looks at Sam once more. 
SUZIE Look.  I just don't want to get into any more trouble... 
Tom Baxter rises to his feet.  The Judge raises a hand, motioning him to sit back down. 
JUDGE (to Baxter) The Court would like to hear what Miss Toller has to say. (to Suzie) Miss Toller. 
SUZIE Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.  He didn't rape Kelly either.  He didn't do anything. 
QUICK CUTS 
Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table. 
Sandra's hand covers her mouth.  Baxter mumbles a curse. 
Sam hangs his head in relief.  Ken grins above his neck brace. 
COURTROOM LOBBY 
The press corps scrambles for cameras. 
BLUE BAY HIGS 
Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV. 
JIMMY I don't believe it... 
IN THE COURTROOM 
Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to make themselves heard above the din. 
HUNTER Your Honor... I must object... 
JUDGE (hammering for order) I think I made it plain that the Court intends to near Miss Toller's story. 
The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie. 
SUZIE I'm sorry. 
JUDGE Sorry?  Just how far did you intend to let this go? 
SUZIE I don't know.  I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo.

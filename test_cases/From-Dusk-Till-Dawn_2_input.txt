SCOTT Kill me, Kate! 
Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times. 
One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott. 
The remaining vamps approach. 
All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon. 
SETH How many bullets left, kid? 
KATE Not many. 
SETH Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper. 
The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. 
The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched. 
KATE (to Seth) Should I use the last bullets on us? 
SETH You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you. 
The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire. 
Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. 
Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before. 
SETH Shoot more holes! 
Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area. 
The .45's empty. 
The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. 
The two survivors hold hands, when... 
All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside. 
The vamps look towards it in horror. 
From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent. 
VOICE (O.S.) (in Spanish) I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in there? 
SETH (yelling) Carlos! (in Spanish) Help us, bash the door. Bash the door in! 
CARLOS (O.S.) (in Spanish) Danny, Manny, knock down the door. Hurry, hurry! 
The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto each other. 
The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door. 
The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward. 
The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames. 
The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves in fright. 
Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps combust in fiery explosions. 
The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control. 
Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot. 
EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by Carlos's Mercedes. 
CARLOS (to Seth) What the fuck was going on in there?

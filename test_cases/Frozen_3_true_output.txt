DAN Stay there. Don't get off the 
D chair. 
PARKER (O.C.) How bad is it? 
E Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is bleeding. Bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants.

CUT TO: 
42   EXT. MOUNT HOLLISTON - CONTINUOUS                           42 Dan's screams can barely be heard from this distance. The blanket of snow muffles all sounds of life on the mountain.

X strong for me, Parker. Can you do that? 
He looks every which way, trying to come up with a solution.

PARKER 
A What are we gonna do?     We're gonna die up here.

X PARKER (to Dan below) Can you stop the bleeding? 
R DAN (O.C.) With what? 
PARKER Here... 
A She takes off her scarf and tosses it below. 
It blows away into the trees.       It doesn't even make it halfway. 
M PARKER (cont'd) SHIT! 
Lynch removes his scarf and balls it up. 
LYNCH Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down. 
D DAN (O.C.) I can't see. 
LYNCH 
E Just feel for it, OK?       Here it comes... 
He drops the balled up scarf.

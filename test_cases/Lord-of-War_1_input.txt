Yuri looks away, knows where this is going. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) You may ask, why do I bother to do that?  I can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your company.  And you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive.  No. The reason I delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims.  I don't think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them.  Some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free. 
Valentine looks to his watch. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five minutes. 
Valentine walks away.  Yuri is left to ponder the notion. 
We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs, eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals.  Finally the time lapse slows back into real time. 
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents. 
VALENTINE You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you. 
Valentine opens the back of the Jeep.  Lying in the back, the bodies of the two PILOTS shot and stripped. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) The locals got to them before we could. 
Yuri turns away from the sight.  His handcuffs are removed. 
Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and NICKI in the wallet. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) Handsome family. 
Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away. 
EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DUSK. 
YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle. 
A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color: U.N. white.  The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to a stop.  A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE. 
VIVIAN (pleasantly surprised) Yuri!  Yuri Orlov! 
YURI (giving her an embarrassed hug) Vivian... 
VIVIAN What are you doing here? 
YURI (approaching the window) You know.  Fighting the good fight. 
VIVIAN An aid program? 
YURI Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some transport problems.  You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you? 
VIVIAN Sure.  Climb in. 
Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar. 
VIVIAN (cant' d) We're pulling out.  It's too dangerous. It's a shame.  We were really doing some good things. 
Yuri nods in understanding. 
INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.  NIGHT. 
A weary YURI enters his room.  Sitting on the green sofa - bound and gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood - SIMEON. 
YURI Jesus!  Simeon! 
ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the door, laughing at his shocked reaction. 
YURI (cont'd) Andre!  What in heaven is he doing here? 
ANDRE JNR. A gift for you. 
Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes. 
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd) You got here just in time.  I was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him. 
He offers Yuri a Beretta. 
YURI Me?! 
ANDRE JNR. Who do you think informed on you - cost you your plane?  He came to meet my father, hoping to take your place. 
Yuri spits on Simeon. 
YURI You stupid old fuck! 
ANDRE JNR. (knowing smile) He killed your man when he tried to kill you. 
Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta. 
YURI No. 
ANDRE JNR. (confused) You want us to let him go? 
YURI No.  No.  I... 
Andre offers him the gun a third time.  Yuri refuses it.

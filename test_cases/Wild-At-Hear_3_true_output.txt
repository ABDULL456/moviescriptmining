LULA I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes dyin right in front of our eyes... 
SAILOR Im afraid she is, baby. 
Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her forehead. 
GIRL (wide-eyed now) Get my lipstick... (whisper) Its in my purse. 
The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula starts to cry. 
LULA She died right in front of me.  Whyd she have to go and do that, Sailor? 
SAILOR Lets get outta here, honey. 
Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car. Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder. Sailor starts the car and takes off. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
123. INT. THUNDERBIRD - BIG TUNA - MORNING 
The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which has a sign on it that says BIG TUNA, TEXAS.  Sailor cruises the T-Bird along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place. 
SAILOR Well, it aint exactly Emerald City... 
LULA Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it aint even noon yet. 
123A. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - MORNING 
Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel. 
SAILOR Thisll do. 
CUT TO: 
124. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY 
The room is simple: double bed, dresser, mirror, chair, sink, toilet, bathtub (no shower), electric fan, window overlooking the street. 
SAILOR Not bad for eleven dollars a day. 
LULA No radio or TV... 
She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the bed. 
LULA And no AC. 
SAILOR Fan works. 
LULA Now what? 
SAILOR Lets get a sandwich and find out about some work. 
LULA Sailor? 
SAILOR Yeah? 
LULA This aint exactly my most thrillin notion of startin a new life. 
They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and slumps down on the edge of the bed. 
LULA Im gonna stay here in this room, Sailor.  I dont feel so good?  This heat makes me tired. 
SAILOR Okay, honey, Ill see you later. 
CUT TO: 
125. EXT. REDS GARAGE - DAY 
A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage. 
SAILOR You Red? 
RED (with a smile) Well, I aint Blackie. 
Sailor holds out his right hand to shake. 
SAILOR Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at the drugstore thought you might have some work I could do. 
Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes. 
RED Things aint real hot right now. Rex, there though, (nodding toward a half-naked man burrowed under an 83 Buick) is about to relocate in about a week to San Angelo.  I might could use a man when he does...  You good with engines? 
SAILOR I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they used to call me Wrench when I was a kid. 
RED Well see how she goes then when Rex takes off.  Check back. 
Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the other has an LBJ straw Stetson. 
SPARKY Hows it look? 
RED Reckon the heads cracked, like I thought.

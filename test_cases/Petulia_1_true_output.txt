ARCHIE'S VOICE Barney, for Chrissake, I'm listening to you, 
BARNEY'S VOICE You're thinking about that hot cat in your bed, you bastard. 
19 CONTINUED Now, in the continuous luncheon fashion show, the "Psychedelic Yvonne" has appeared, topless amid a wild pattern of lights, The dialogue between Barney and Archie continues elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes: 
20 INT. HOSPITAL 
The left side of a patient's face and the right shoulder and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow. These various colors indicate physical conditions. They are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and their assistants, 
BARNEY'S VOICE My record is far from spotless, if you don't know that, who does? But baby, it's just not the answer, not at our age. 
ARCHIE'S VOICE So what's the answer, baby? 
BARNEY'S VOICE â¢ Someplace you can belch without saying excuse me! 
ARCHIE'S VOICE I can do that in the steam room at the YMCA. 
BARNEY'S VOICE (going right on) And if a little monkey business comes along, whose gonna throw rocks? You and Polo were a marvellous looking couple. 
21 INT. HOSPITAL LEAD ROOM 
The patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic computer. The activator moves in a rhythmic, graceful pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants. The door leading to outside is three inches thick and solid lead. The noise from the equipment is deafening.

10 BARNEY'S VOICE Is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple? People turning around to stare? What was it, Archie? The sex bit? Huh? The ole sex bit ,,,? 
ARCHIE'S VOICE Barney, what would you say if I told you that one day I just got very tired of being married? 
22 INT. A DECOMPRESSION OPERATING ROOM 
This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on. The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors and nurses communicate with each other through throat mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this the patient simply does not exist. The colors are eerie yellows and blues with only occasionally and very impersonally the red of blood, 
BARNEY'S VOICE (he never listens) It's still better than being out there in the dark, all by your goddam lonesome! Nobody has a life anymore. Quicksand, It scares me. What do you want, Archie? 
23 INT. DOCTOR'S GYM 
Archie and Barney are in a white cubicle playing handball. Their dialogue, of course, continues, 
ARCHIE 
(GASPING) I don't know what I want. To feel something, 
BARNEY 
(GASPING) That's no answer; Archie, grow up! The ball comes whizzing at Barney who suddenly wants it to hit him, which it does, 
BARNEY Archie, what am I going to do about Wilma? 
24 EXT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT LATE AFTERNOON 
Archie has just parked his car and is going toward the entrance, when he sees Petulia sitting on a bus-stop bench, the tuba beside her. She is dozing. 
ARCHIE 
(SOFTLY) Hey, you. She opens her eyes, smiles. 
PETULIA I'm drunk.

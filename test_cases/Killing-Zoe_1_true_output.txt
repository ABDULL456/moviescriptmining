He points to the main floor vault. 
ERIC Here.  This is where they keep the days reserve cash.  Okay fuck that. 
He flips the page to the lower level blueprint. 
ERIC There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into.  This is where the real prize is. 
ZED What kind of vault is that? 
He checks the blueprint. 
ERIC Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber. 
ZED Caliber? (he thinks about it) It'll take three hours. 
ERIC No, that's too long. 
ZED That's how long it'll take. 
ERIC Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be in and out. (he snaps his fingers) Like that.  Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and... 
He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture." 
ZED Well hold on a second. (pointing to the blueprint) What's this? 
Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault. 
ERIC Another vault. 
ZED No this. 
Eric looks closely at the blueprint. 
ERIC I don't know...it connects the two vaults. 
ZED Well, what kind of vault is this other one? 
ERIC (reading the blueprint) Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon. 
ZED Why would those two vaults be connected? 
ERIC I don't know. 
ZED Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.  Maybe less. 
ERIC But this entry way is too small to get the platen out.  We have a lot of merchandise in there. 
ZED No, don't you see?  We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault.  From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes. 
ERIC You could open it in five minutes? 
ZED From the inside it's easy. 
ERIC (excited) Hot damn.  That is our answer. 
ZED Okay.  When is Bastille day? 
ERIC Tomorrow. 
ZED Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow? 
ERIC But of course. 
ZED It's impossible. 
ERIC It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what to do. 
ZED I don't know what to do. 
ERIC You don't need to know shit.  Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest. 
ZED I haven't even seen the bank. 
ERIC Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we live life.  It's better that way.  Okay? 
ZED (unsure) Okay. 
ERIC Good.  Now we do heroin!

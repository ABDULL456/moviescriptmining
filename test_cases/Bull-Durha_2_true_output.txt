MICKEY'S WIFE Do you think your husband plays around on the road trips? 
DEKE'S WIFE No way. Well... God... do we have to talk about that? 
MICKEY'S WIFE I guess not... it's just that once I asked Mickey if he was faithful to me on the road trips and he said "in his heart he was faithful". (beat) What the hell does that mean? 
DEKE'S WIFE It means he's unfaithful -- but only a man would put it in those words.

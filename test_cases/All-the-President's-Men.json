{"train": "ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - by William Goldman \n\"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN\" \nby \nWilliam Goldman \nBased on the novel \n\"All The President's Men\" \nby \nCarl Bernstein and Bob Woodward \nPre-rehearsal version March, 1975 \nStart with as few credits as possible. When they're over-- \nFADE IN ON: \nA TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE. \nWe see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen. As the tape is pressed around a door-- \nBEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE. \nIt's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as many \"if only's\" included as possible. (\"If only\" the tape had been attached up and down instead of around the door, Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; \"if only\" the first police car called had gone to investigate, Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely away.) \nThe break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber surgical gloves. HOLD on the hands a moment; then-- \nGO TO: \nA DARK APARTMENT. \nThe phone rings. WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver, turns on the bed light. He listens a moment. \nWOODWARD No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. (he hangs up) Son of a bitch. \nHe lies back. The apartment is one room, a small terrace beyond. Not much of a place. \nWOODWARD lies still, staring at the ceiling. He blinks, blinks again. HOLD... \nCUT TO: \nTHE ENORMOUS FIFTH FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST. \nIt looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted. Those reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers. \nHARRY ROSENFELD surveys the scene from his office doorway as WOODWARD approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far from where ROSENFELD is standing. \nROSENFELD Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love? \nWOODWARD You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling? \nROSENFELD As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. (chomps on some Maalox tablets) Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters-- (WOODWARD is surprised-- he hadn't known) --and (b) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying-- (consults a piece of paper) --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices. (puts paper down) Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills. \nWOODWARD Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse? \nROSENFELD (nods) Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. \nWOODWARD hurries along, goes inside as we \nCUT TO: \nA CORRIDOR INSIDE. WOODWARD comes down it, looks around, sees a door marked \"Counsel's Offices\" and heads toward it. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nA CLERK AT A DESK as WOODWARD comes up. Behind them, two lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and gesticulating to each other. \nWOODWARD (to the COUNSEL'S CLERK) Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the Watergate. \nCLERK These two were appointed-- (indicates the angry men) --only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel. (he starts to laugh) \nFIRST ANGRY LAWYER (to CLERK) When you gonna stop thinking it's so funny. \nSECOND ANGRY LAWYER (To CLERK) We wouldda done a terrific job protecting those guys. (neither lawyer, by the way, is Clarence Darrow) \nFIRST ANGRY LAWYER You think we're not as good as some hotshot fancy lawyer?-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE COURTROOM and business is booming. Muggers, pimp, hookers, their families and friends. In the scene that follows, a constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a JUDGE who sets bond, and then shuttled out. \nThe JUDGE indicates the bald burglar. \nJUDGE Your name, please. \nMCCORD James McCord. \nJUDGE Will you step forward, sir. (MCCORD obeys) \nWOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard. \nJUDGE And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord? \nMCCORD (softly) Security consultant. \nJUDGE Where? \nMCCORD (softer) Government. Recently retired. \nJUDGE Where in government? \nMCCORD (we can't really make this out) ...Central... Intelligence... Agency... \nJUDGE (he can't either) Where? \nMCCORD (clearing his throat) The C.I.A. \nAnd on these words, \nZOOM TO: \nCLOSE UP--WOODWARD leaning over the fence practically falling over it in a desperate straining effort to catch what's going on. \nWOODWARD (stunned) Holy shit. \nNow from the courtroom-- \nCUT TO: \nTHOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WASHINGTON POSTS. \nWe are at the end of the press run, the papers are all assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various places. As the papers continue to roll past-- \nA UNION TYPE EMPLOYEE grabs a paper, looks at the front page. \nThe Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is visible. The byline was by Alfred E. Lewis. The union type Post employee glances at the article-- \nUNION POST EMPLOYEE (reading half-aloud) \"Five men, one of whom said he is a former employee...\" (stops reading, gives a shrug) Schmucks. \nAnd he turns happily to the sports section-- \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE UP OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. \nIt's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed. Someone is going through the cash, making a quick count. During this-- \nFIRST VOICE (V.O.) Hurry it, huh, Bachinski? \nBACHINSKI You said I could look at it-- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nWe're in a room in a police station and two men are present. One, a COP, is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door. The other, BACHINSKI, is taking hurried notes in a reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence. \nCOP --I said look, not memorize-- \nBACHINSKI --almost done, give it a rest, all right... (and he looks at an address book, he stops) \nCUT TO: \nTHE ADDRESS BOOK. Beside the name \"Howard E. Hunt\" is the notation \"W.House.\" Now, BACHINSKI hurriedly opens the other book to the letter \"H\" and there is the same name, \"Howard E. Hunt\" and beside it, the letters, \"W.H.\" \nCOP (V.O.) What'd you find? \nBACHINSKI (V.O.) Beats me. These notebooks belonged to Cuban guys? \nCOP (V.O.) S'right. \nBACHINSKI (V.O.) It's gotta mean either White House or whore house, one or the other. \nWe HOLD on the HUNT name, and the address notations. Then-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. \nThe phone rings, waking him. He fumbles for the phone and the light, finally gets them both. \nWOODWARD Bachinski? (reaches for a notebook) What?--hold it-- (gets it open, starts to write) --OK, go on, go on... \nAnd as he rises-- \nPAN TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking silently out of the newsroom then turning left down a darker corridor, passing bulletin boards and wall lockers and it's all nice and quiet as they amble on, nodding to the few people they pass on their way and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge which is empty; the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are visible, selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they are alone, the silence ends. \nWOODWARD What the hell were you doing rewriting my story-- \nBERNSTEIN --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?-- \nWOODWARD --it was fine the way it was-- \nBERNSTEIN --it was bullshit the way it was-- \nWOODWARD --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?-- \nBERNSTEIN (a sore subject) --what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen-- \nWOODWARD --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau-- \nBERNSTEIN --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale-- \nWOODWARD --Bradlee went to Harvard-- \nBERNSTEIN --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart-- \nWOODWARD --I'm smart enough to know my story was solid-- \nBERNSTEIN --mine's better-- \nWOODWARD --no way-- \nBERNSTEIN (handing them over) --read 'em both and you'll see-- \nAnd as WOODWARD glances at the two stories-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN watching. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD. He glances from one story to the other. Then, disconsolately-- \nWOODWARD ...crap... \nAnd he sinks down in a chair. \nBERNSTEIN Is mine better? \nWOODWARD nods. \nWOODWARD (handing the stories back) What is it about my writing that's so rotten? \nBERNSTEIN (as he exits) Mainly it has to do with your choice of words. \nAnd as he goes, leaving WOODWARD just sitting there-- \nCUT TO: \nBERSTEIN, re-entering the newsroom, returning to his desk. He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter, hesitates, lights a cigarette. He inhales, as, behind him, WOODWARD briefly is visible going to his desk behind the pillar. \nFinally BERNSTEIN inserts the paper, starts to type as \nWOODWARD (V.O.) (from behind the pillar) Carl? \nBERNSTEIN (turns) Yeah? \nWOODWARD (pushing his chair briefly into view) Fuck you, Carl. \nAnd as he rolls forward again, out of sight-- \nCUT TO: \nRICHARD NIXON ON THE TUBE. \n(It's the June 22 Press Conference.) He talks on about something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not have been smiling. Hints of pressure maybe, that's all, and once it's established-- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nWOODWARD sitting alone, gloomily staring at the set. We're in the Post Cafeteria, it's the next morning, and the place is pretty much empty. He sips the coffee, it tastes rotten. BERNSTEIN moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of his own. He stands by WOODWARD briefly. \nBERNSTEIN You heard? (WOODWARD glances up) They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together. (WOODWARD nods, BERNSTEIN sits down) Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit. \nWOODWARD It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure. \nBERNSTEIN Forget it, the main thing-- (stops) --did you call me a failure? \nWOODWARD I was sure trying. \nLIBRARIAN (V.O.) (elderly-sounding lady) Library. \nBERNSTEIN Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. I was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy. \nLIBRARIAN (V.O.) I think I do remember, he took out a whole bunch of material. Let me just go see. \nSOUND of the phone being laid down. \nBERNSTEIN --what do you think?-- \nWOODWARD --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant. \nBERNSTEIN Maybe a political operative of some sort-- \nWOODWARD --a spy, you mean? \nBERNSTEIN It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy. \nLIBRARIAN (V.O.) Mr. Bernstein? \nBERNSTEIN Yes, ma'am. \nLIBRARIAN (V.O.) What I said before? I was wrong. The truth is, I don't have a card that Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy material. (WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN listen, and now there is something in her voice that wasn't there before: fear) I remember getting that material out for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I've never had any requests at all from Mr. Hunt. (beat) The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt. \nThere is the SOUND of the phone being dropped into its cradle. BERNSTEIN continues to hold his. He and WOODWARD just look at each other. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. \nNow, as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN get out of a cab, start inside-- \nCUT TO: \nA MALE LIBRARIAN IN HIS OFFICE. \nLIBRARIAN You want all the material requested by the White House? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN standing there. The nod. One of them maybe says \"yessir,\" the other maybe \"please.\" The LIBRARIAN moves out of his office into a corridor. They go with him. No one else is around. The LIBRARIAN looks at them, quickly-- \nLIBRARIAN All White House transactions are confidential. \nAnd just like that, he's back into his office, and as he shuts the door-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking along through the Library of Congress. \nWOODWARD You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet. \nBERNSTEIN We need a sympathetic face. \nOn the word \"face\"-- \nCUT TO: \nA BEARDED YOUNG-LOOKING CLERK. We're in the reading room of the library, and WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are with him. \nYOUNG CLERK You want every request since when? \nBERNSTEIN (to WOODWARD) When did Hunt start at the White House? \nWOODWARD July of '71. \nBERNSTEIN About the past year. \nCLERK (starts to smile) I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got 'em. \nNow-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN seated at a table with from anywhere between 10 to 20 thousand slips of paper. In front of them, seated at a high desk, the bearded clerk looks down on them, shaking his head. It's a staggering amount of work to thumb through. \nCLERK I can't believe you guys are actually doing this. \nWOODWARD (to the clerk) You do a lot of things when you're on a story. (to BERNSTEIN, quietly) Can you believe we're actually doing this? (BERNSTEIN can't) \nNow we have a series of shots of the two of them going through the slips; it took them hours and hours, and the afternoon darkened as they worked. And they're tired. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN getting back into a cab. \nBERNSTEIN That was fun. (slams the door) What now? \nWOODWARD I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion. \nCUT TO: \nA STREET as WOODWARD runs by. It's not the nicest area in the world. He is going faster now. \nCUT TO: \nA CAB GASSING UP AT A STATION. WOODWARD hurries to it, gets in and-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE SECOND CAB roaring along some Washington streets. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD INSIDE THE CAB. He looks at his watch, tries not to seem nervous. But his fingers are drumming, drumming and-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE SECOND CAB stopping, as WOODWARD gets out, pays. The cab starts off, but slowly. WOODWARD waits. The cab doesn't turn as the first one did. WOODWARD still waits. Finally the cab turns and the second it does, WOODWARD starts to run again and-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD turning a corner, running on and-- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it, finally stops and catches his breath as we-- \nCUT TO: \nA GIGANTIC UNDERGROUND TYPE GARAGE \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE. It's an eerie place, and his heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy, yes he's edgy. He comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels, hesitates. \nCUT TO: \nTHE RAMP. It seems to descend forever. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD starting down. HOLD on him as he walks. Down he goes, the shadows deepening, then disappearing, then covering him again. He continues on. He must be at least at the first underground level now but he doesn't stop, and we don't stop watching him as he continues to go down, turning, the SOUND of his shoes softer now and he's a smaller figure as we watch him circle around and around until we-- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER LEVEL UNDERGROUND. Dimly lit. A few cars parked here and there. WOODWARD hesitates on the ramp, looks around. \nTHE GARAGE. Dark, dark, eerie. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD quietly stepping off the ramp, continuing to glance this way, that way. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTWO CARS PARKED BESIDE EACH OTHER. \nNothing unusual about that. But then some cigarette smoke appears, trailing up and disappearing from between the cars. As WOODWARD moves forward-- \nCUT TO: \nA MAN SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES BETWEEN THE CARS, smoking. He leans with his back against the wall. \nDEEP THROAT I saw the flag signal--what's up? \nWOODWARD Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground. \nDEEP THROAT You thought I'd help out on specifics? (headshake) I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all. (looks at WOODWARD) Are you guys really working? (WOODWARD nods) How much? \nWOODWARD I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up. \nDEEP THROAT Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand. \nWOODWARD If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me? \nDEEP THROAT Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. (inhales) You come up with anything? \nWOODWARD John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth. (DEEP THROAT nods) Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag. \nDEEP THROAT Follow the money. Always follow the money. \nWOODWARD To where? \nDEEP THROAT (shakes his head \"no\") Go on. \nWOODWARD This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what. \nDEEP THROAT (lights a new cigarette) You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you? \nat the water fountain on the 5th floor. He chews up a few Maalox tablets, notices BERNSTEIN steaming up. \nBERNSTEIN Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker-- \nROSENFELD --so? \nBERNSTEIN I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami. \nROSENFELD heads for his office, BERNSTEIN pursuing. \nROSENFELD I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein-- \nBERNSTEIN (trying to head him off) --that was awhile ago-- \nROSENFELD --\"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto.\" That was your spiel then. \"The Lifestyles of Deserters.\" (whirls on BERNSTEIN) I'm still waiting for it. \nHe enters his office, BERNSTEIN follows. \nBERNSTEIN Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do? \nROSENFELD You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill? \nAnd he looks unsympathetically at BERNSTEIN-- \nCUT TO: \nSIMONS circling around the 5th floor. ROSENFELD falls into step. They keep moving throughout. \nROSENFELD I can predict the next words you're gonna say: \"anyone but Bernstein.\" (SIMONS gestures for ROSENFELD to continue) I want to send a reporter to Miami. \nSIMONS Anyone but Bernstein. \nROSENFELD Howard-- \nSIMONS --remember Toronto, Harry. \nROSENFELD That was awhile ago. \nSIMONS I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him. \nROSENFELD I know, I did, but damnit Howard-- (SIMONS looks at him) For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping... \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN'S APARTMENT. \nA shambles. He is busy doing two things at once, studying notebooks and packing. Music plays, lovely stuff; the Bach Brandenburgs. As the phone rings-- \nBERNSTEIN (answering) Yeah? (pause) Yes, this is Carl Bernstein. (stunned) You're repossessing my bicycle? (softer) Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's installment, so why don't you check your records before you go around hassling people? (pause) Oh... \nAnd as he stands there-- \nAN ATTRACTIVE, EFFICIENT-LOOKING WOMAN of BERNSTEIN's age. She has just entered the apartment. Vivaldi is playing now. \nBERNSTEIN Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast. \nHANNAH (glancing around the chaos) Where are your bills, Carl? \nBERNSTEIN Oh, they're here. (starts lifting debris from his desk) I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah. (grabbing a big manila envelope) See? (hands it to her) \nHANNAH (looks inside) Carl, it's a jungle. (sits at his desk, takes out a mass of papers--glancing at the top bill) I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. (studies another bill) You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for. \nHe smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances. \nBERNSTEIN Hey... very tense. \nHANNAH (nods) Lot of pressure at the Star. (looking at the bills) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. (sighs) How much did the damn bike cost? \nBERNSTEIN Five hundred; six maybe. \nHANNAH (looking at paper) You're two months behind--you got enough to cover? \nBERNSTEIN I think. \nHANNAH Give me your checkbook then. \nBERNSTEIN It's right under that pile. \nHe indicates a mound of papers. She pulls it out as he continues to massage her, more sensually now. She reaches back, puts her hand on his. \nHANNAH I thought you had to get to Miami. \nBERNSTEIN There's always a later plane. \nHANNAH You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl? \nBERNSTEIN Nobody's perfect. (more rubbing now) I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper. \nHANNAH looks at BERNSTEIN a moment; then she smiles gently, shakes her head. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BUDGET MEETING \nSIMONS --OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything else? \nThe foreign editor, an enormously thoughtful-looking and respected man, indicates \"no.\" \nSIMONS (to another editor) National? \nNATIONAL EDITOR I'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacement--that's your page one stuff right there, Howard-- \nSIMONS --Metropolitan?-- \nROSENFELD --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions-- \nNATIONAL EDITOR --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions-- \nROSENFELD (to NATIONAL EDITOR) --quit equivocating, say what you mean-- (to SIMONS and BRADLEE) --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances-- \nBRADLEE --and we printed that, didn't we, Harry? And when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too-- \nNATIONAL EDITOR --let me tell what happened when I was having lunch today at the Sans Souci-- \nROSENFELD --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci-- \nNATIONAL EDITOR --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein? \nROSENFELD Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk-- \nNATIONAL EDITOR --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?-- \nROSENFELD --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting-- \nNATIONAL EDITOR --well, what if your boys get it wrong-- \nBRADLEE (after a beat) Then it's our asses, isn't it? \nSIMONS (indicates the meeting is over) And we'll all have to go to work for a living. \nAs the men rise and head for the door, the FOREIGN EDITOR moves toward BRADLEE and SIMONS who remain seated as before. \nFOREIGN EDITOR I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story. (BRADLEE and SIMONS look at him) I don't think we should cover the story, period. \nBRADLEE Go on. \nFOREIGN EDITOR It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff. \nSIMONS What then? \nFOREIGN EDITOR I don't believe the goddamn story, Howard, it doesn't make sense. \nBRADLEE It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time. \nFOREIGN EDITOR Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom? \nBRADLEE and SIMONS say nothing. They respect this guy. \nFOREIGN EDITOR Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em. (sits on the table, talks quietly on) Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans? \nBRADLEE You saying the Democrats bugged themselves? \nFOREIGN EDITOR The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. (rises, starts out) Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business. \nHe leaves. BRADLEE and SIMONS stay where they are, both of them flattened by what the guy's said. Because they're not sure he's wrong... HOLD. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAPERS POURING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE. \nWe're back with the UNION GUY from before. He pulls out a paper again, looks at a story on the front page-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE WOODWARD/BERNSTEIN STORY that said the GAO found that CREEP has mishandled over $500,000 in campaign funds. \nUNION GUY (to another UNION GUY who's reading over his shoulder) What'd'ya think? \nSECOND UNION GUY Politics as usual, someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that's all. \nUNION GUY (he's not so sure) Big fuckin' cookie jar. \nAs he turns to the sports section-- \nCUT TO: \nGETTING THE CREEP LIST SEQUENCE. \nEither they get it as it is now, or as they really did, from a Post researcher who knew someone. In ant case, we see the list, with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices and phone extensions. \nCUT TO: \nA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN-- \n--kind of an honest, hard-working face. \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are standing in her doorway. \nWOODWARD A friend at the Committee told us to contact you-- \nWOMAN --who was it? \nBERNSTEIN We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us. \nWOODWARD It's safe, try it, you'll see. \nShe doesn't talk at first, but she doesn't slam the door either. \nBERNSTEIN We understand your problem-- \nWOODWARD --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal. \nBERNSTEIN We appreciate your position--really. \nAnd now she starts, at last, to talk, and they expect it to be their first breakthrough, but when it turns out to be the most withering onslaught yet, they are stunned. \nWOMAN You people--you think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out. (to BERNSTEIN) You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, mister. (to WOODWARD) And you don't understand nothing. (voice rising) But the Committee's briefed us on you--so get the hell out of here-- (big) --do you like scaring the life out of decent people?--'cause if you don't, in the name of God--stop it! \nAnd she slams the door-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, slowly walking back in silence back to the car. \nWOODWARD At Yale once, they held an auction. There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and I'd never heard of her before but I knew I had to have those cards, I had to know why anyone would get so many messages. I paid sixty-five dollars for them... I got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then I found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once I had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed. Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards, they were her eyes... \nThey continue to walk; slowly. \nCUT TO: \nA MIDDLE-AGED MAN--IN HIS DOORWAY \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN I know who you are and I'm not afraid but that don't mean I'll talk to you either--you're just a couple Democrats out to stop Nixon getting re-elected. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, staring at the man. \nWOODWARD Democrats? \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN That's right. \nBERNSTEIN I hate both parties. \nWOODWARD And I'm a Republican. \nThe middle-aged man looks at him. \nBERNSTEIN (surprised, turns to WOODWARD) Republican? \nWOODWARD Sure. \nBERNSTEIN Who'd you vote for? \nWOODWARD When? \nBERNSTEIN \nWOODWARD Nixon. \nBERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we-- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER SERIES OF CREEP EMPLOYEES. \nOnly they aren't slamming doors, they're sitting in various rooms of their houses and apartments. We don't see the reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive make it self-evident. We start with the middle-aged man seen above. \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN Mitchell never left the Committee-- he resigned, sure, but he was there as much as before-- \nCUT TO: \nYOUNGER MAN --oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it's not that Gordon's crazy, he's... (pauses, looking for the right word) ...weird. I'll give you some Committee people who know about him--only don't tell it was me-- \nCUT TO: \nYOUNGER WOMAN --of course we were briefed on what to say--and never to volunteer anything-- \nCUT TO: \nThe BOOKKEEPER kneads her hands together silently. BERNSTEIN watches. \nBERNSTEIN I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it? \nBOOKKEEPER ...No... never in so many words... \nBERNSTEIN (gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone. \nHe takes out his notebook. \nCUT TO: \nThe BOOKKEEPER. And she does want to talk. But the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it. \nBERNSTEIN I'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so I can keep things straight. (beat) Start with the money, why don't you? \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (returning with coffee) How do you like it? \nBERNSTEIN Everything, please. \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (going again) I won't be a minute. \nBERNSTEIN (to the BOOKKEEPER, quietly) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning? \nBOOKKEEPER (about to fold) There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot-- \nBERNSTEIN --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it? \nBOOKKEEPER A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. \nBERNSTEIN Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars. \nBOOKKEEPER (her words are coming faster) I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried. \nBERNSTEIN Which people? \nBOOKKEEPER The ones who could disburse the money. \nBERNSTEIN Who were they? \nBOOKKEEPER There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names. \nBERNSTEIN Sloan knew which five, didn't he? (she nods) \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (back with cream and sugar) Here we are. \nBOOKKEEPER I don't want to say anymore. \nBERNSTEIN (indicating coffee) It's awfully hot-- (smiles) --and you haven't finished telling me about the money-- \nBOOKKEEPER (long pause; then--in a burst) --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it. \nBERNSTEIN (heart starting to pound) Gordon Liddy, you mean? \nBOOKKEEPER (nods) It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. (more and more moved now) ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it. \nBERNSTEIN Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way. \nThere is a pause. Then-- \nBOOKKEEPER If you guys... if you guys could just get John Mitchell... that would be beautiful... \nAnd now, as long last, she begins to cry. HOLD on her tears, then-- \nCUT TO: \nA TYPEWRITER \nclicking away. The words \"INTERVIEW WITH X. SEPT. 14\" are visible. There is music in the background, really blasting away, Rachmaninoff or worse. \nWe are in WOODWARD's apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview. It's very late, and BERNSTEIN has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read. They're both really excited, BERNSTEIN from his coffee jag, WOODWARD by what BERNSTEIN's dictating. \nBERNSTEIN I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth. \nWOODWARD Go on, go on-- \nBERNSTEIN --we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in. \nWOODWARD Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit. \nBERNSTEIN It goes very high--we've got to find out where-- \nWOODWARD --we will-- \nBERNSTEIN --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper. \nWOODWARD That happens to people. (he goes over, turns the hi-fi on even louder. Shouts--) OK, go on. \nThe noise blasts away as BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD hunch over the typewriter. It's a moment of genuine exhilaration. Paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to something; it's all starting to split open... \nSLOAN I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial. \nWOODWARD You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done-- \nBERNSTEIN --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written-- \nSLOAN --they're worse. That's why I quit. \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN wait as SLOAN is clearly going through a struggle with himself. Then-- \nSLOAN Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of. \nBERNSTEIN Do you think the truth will come out at the trial? \nSLOAN That's another of the things I'm not so sure of. \nBERNSTEIN Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors? \nSLOAN We were never told flat out \"Don't talk.\" But the message was clear. \nBERNSTEIN To cover up? \nSLOAN Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth. \nWOODWARD Does \"they\" mean the White House? \nSLOAN As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that. \nWOODWARD The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true? \nSLOAN No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand. \nWOODWARD And as treasurer, you could release those funds? \nSLOAN (nods) When so ordered. \nWOODWARD We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. (SLOAN is silent) \nBERNSTEIN (ticking them off) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious-- \nSLOAN stirs his coffee. \nWOODWARD --there had to be a White House overseer-- \nBERNSTEIN --Colson. \nSLOAN Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that. \nWOODWARD (to BERNSTEIN) Haldeman. (to SLOAN) Right? \nSLOAN I won't talk about the other two. \nBERNSTEIN But they both worked at the White House? \nSLOAN (softly) I will not talk about the other two. \nBERNSTEIN (out of the blue) Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer. \nSLOAN is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach. \nSLOAN I can't say anything, I'm sorry. (He starts to rise) \nWOODWARD One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work? \nSLOAN Badly. (and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it. \nBERNSTEIN Right. \nSLOAN Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed. \nWOODWARD Go on. \nSLOAN Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story. \nBERNSTEIN Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure? \nSLOAN Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say \"go ahead, give out the money.\" \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN just look at each other--they hadn't known it, not remotely. SLOAN stands and as they head for the door-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE THREE OF THEM heading across the foyer. \nBERNSTEIN What happens when the baby comes? \nSLOAN We're moving. (beat) I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them. \nCUT TO: \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard. \nBERNSTEIN Sir, I'd like to ask you a few-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --what time is it? \nBERNSTEIN \nMITCHELL (V.O.) Morning or night? \nBERNSTEIN Night. \nMITCHELL (V.O.) Oh. \nAnd he hangs up. \nCUT TO: \nBRADLEE and BERNSTEIN at BERNSTEIN's desk. BRADLEE is going over BERNSTEIN's notes. \nBRADLEE He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? (BERNSTEIN nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words \"her tit\" and run it. \nAnd now suddenly-- \nTHE PRESSES OF THE POST \nrolling the story. They're modern and gigantic and \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic. \nBRADLEE comes up behind them, looks down at the presses, starts to talk. \nBRADLEE Once when I was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life... And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, \"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you.\" (shakes his head) I took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, \"You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--\" (looks at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN) --I screwed up but I wasn't wrong. \nThey all watch the presses now. \nBRADLEE You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless? (as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN nod, BRADLEE starts away) You should be... \nCUT TO: \nTHE PRESSES continuing to roll. The SOUND is incredible. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nA TELETYPE MACHINE \nclacking away like crazy. We can read the words, \"The Senator finished by saying that although he was...\" and from there-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA SENATOR and while the words \"although he was\" are still very fresh in our minds-- \nSENATOR Although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- \nThe SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang. The next two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE. The CREEP voice is very southern, the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer. The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R. SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP office doors and so identified. The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side. As the teletype goes on-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R. MAN \nCREEP P.R. MAN (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination. I can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN \nWHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN --the White House has long since stopped being surprised at this type of reporting by certain elements of the Eastern liberal press-- \nCUT TO: \nBRADLEE'S OFFICE \nA lot of activity. BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches. SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there, WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, too. A kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The editors look at it. \nSIMONS (reading) Same kind of crap-- \nBRADLEE (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate. \nBERNSTEIN What's a real denial? \nBRADLEE If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons. \nCUT TO: \nTHE UNION GUYS IN THE POST \nlooking at a new headline: \nin a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room. WOODWARD hurries in. \nWOODWARD What? \nBRADLEE says nothing, just points to the AP teletype. WOODWARD looks at it, clearly is upset. \nBRADLEE I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- (to BERNSTEIN who tears in--) --you think I like being aced out? \nBERNSTEIN --what?-- \nWOODWARD --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin-- \nBERNSTEIN --the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- (WOODWARD nods) --he say anything we don't know?-- \nWOODWARD (headshake) --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway-- \nBRADLEE --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this-- \nBERNSTEIN --there's nothing new in it-- \nBRADLEE --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- (starts out) --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it-- \nAnd he stalks out. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand staring at the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the L.A. Times story keeps getting longer. \nBERNSTEIN Goddamnit-- \nWOODWARD --shit-- \nBERNSTEIN --we gotta top the Times-- \nWOODWARD --I know, I know-- \nBERNSTEIN --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again-- \nWOODWARD --shit, who do we know?-- \nBERNSTEIN --I know a lawyer at Justice-- \nWOODWARD --has he got an ax?-- \nBERNSTEIN --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat. \nWOODWARD Then he's got an ax. (beat) Call him anyway. \nAs BERNSTEIN nods, takes off out of the room-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE UNION GUYS \nstudying the front page, on which one headline indicates that they're named the guys at CREEP who got the reports. \nFIRST UNION GUY Who is this Woodstein? (points to paper) Two stories on the front page. \nSECOND UNION GUY If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico, to hell with him. \nCUT TO: \nA HOT SHOPPE. \nWOODWARD is stirring his morning coffee as BERNSTEIN comes in, spots him, hurries over. BERNSTEIN is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him. \nBERNSTEIN --I want you to shut up and listen to me-- \nWOODWARD --I haven't said anything-- \nBERNSTEIN --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip-- (carefully) --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing. \nWOODWARD How high up, which Republicans? \nBERNSTEIN That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men-- \nWOODWARD --Haldeman I know, who else? \nBERNSTEIN Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories? \nWOODWARD The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans. \nBERNSTEIN Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in. \nWOODWARD So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece-- \nBERNSTEIN --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed. \nWOODWARD If he self-destructed. \nNow, from the two of them-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN Chapin did contact you then? \nSEGRETTI Sure--off the record. \nBERNSTEIN On the orders of Haldeman? \nSEGRETTI I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls. \nBERNSTEIN It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President. \nSEGRETTI Can't help you. \nBERNSTEIN At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. (SEGRETTI half-smiles, nods) Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all? \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP--SEGRETTI staring at the girls and the blue water. \nSEGRETTI What would you have done if you were just getting out of the Army, if you'd been away from the real world for four years, if you weren't sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the President of the United States...? \nHOLD on the question, then-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN \nback in D.C., walking through the airport. \nBERNSTEIN What would you have done? \nWOODWARD You asking would I have been one of the President's men? (beat) I would have been. \nAs they continue on-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD \nalone in the underground garage. Tense, jumpy. He looks at his watch, paces around. It's all eerie as hell. Then, from the ramps, footsteps. \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT moving out of the shadows, smoking, as always. \nDEEP THROAT My turn to keep you waiting. (approaches) What's the topic for tonight? \nWOODWARD Ratfucking. \nDEEP THROAT In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats. \nWOODWARD I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House. \nDEEP THROAT (nods) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government. \nWOODWARD Who?--be specific. How high up? \nDEEP THROAT You'll have to find that out, won't you. \nWOODWARD The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so-- \nHe stops as suddenly DEEP THROAT dives down behind the nearest car. \nWOODWARD dropping beside him. \nWOODWARD What? \nDEEP THROAT Did you change cabs? (as WOODWARD nods) It didn't work, something moved there-- \nAnd as he points \nCUT TO: \nTHE SHADOWS BY THE RAMP. You can't see a goddamn thing. But there is the SOUND, faint but distinct, of breathing. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD standing, staring into the darkness. He is scared, wipes his mouth. He doesn't move for a moment. Then he walks directly into the darkness and as he's gone-- \nZOOM TO: \nA HORRID FACE IN CLOSE UP, red eyed, unshaven, beaten--there are half-formed scabs and cuts. He is leaning against a wall, shivering. He looks, for all the world, like a perpetual drunk. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD in the shadows, coming closer. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUNK. He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth. He watches WOODWARD approach. \nTHE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE POST \nand it's noisy. Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously. \nCUT TO: \nAN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER MID-30s. On her desk is her name, MARILYN BERGER. She is watching BERNSTEIN who is standing by the water cooler nearby. As she gets up-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN drinking water. \nBERGER Do you guys know about the Canuck letter? \nBERNSTEIN (nods, drinks) Um-hmm. (stops, looks at her) Why? \nBERGER I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it. \nAs she speaks-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a SCREAM comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see, here comes BERNSTEIN dragging BERGER over to WOODWARD's desk. \nBERNSTEIN (hysterical) Tell him what you just told me. \nBERGER Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon--I had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. (she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you? \nAnd now from her-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN in a corner of the room, talking low and fast. \nBERNSTEIN You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names. \nWOODWARD It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon. \nBERNSTEIN You think this was Clawsen's initiation? \nWOODWARD Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. (beat) God knows it worked. \nCUT TO: \nA FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck. This was in the New Hampshire primary, just after the Canuck letter was published. \nWOODWARD (V.O.) You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD ON THE PHONE \nWOODWARD She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you? \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas. \nWOODWARD Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) Where? (beat) What do you mean, where? \nWOODWARD Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant-- \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment. \nThere is a sound of him hanging up the phone. Hard. WOODWARD hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to BERGER who is at her desk-- \nWOODWARD Non denial-denial, Marilyn-- \nBERGER is about to answer when her phone rings. She picks it up, turns to WOODWARD, mouths \"it's him\" and we \nCUT TO: \nBERGER ON THE PHONE. Again Clawsen on the other end. \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) For Chissakes, don't tell them I came to your place. \nBERGER I already told them. \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) Oh, that's terrific, that's just so terrific, I'm thrilled you did that. \nBERGER I have a clear conscience. \nCLAWSEN (V.O.) Marilyn, I have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog. \nNow from this-- \nBRADLEE IN HIS OFFICE GESTURING \nBERNSTEIN Baldwin told the FBI it was you. \nSEDAM Baldwin told the FBI it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy. (looks at the reporters) My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP--SEDAM \nSEDAM You fucked around my life, you two. (starts off) I just wanted to say thanks. \nBRADLEE watching WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, who are clearly upset. \nBRADLEE That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been wrong? (they nod) You had a good source? (nod) Did he have an ax? (pause. Then another nod) \nCLOSE UP--BRADLEE \nBRADLEE All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another. And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. (beat) Make sure it isn't our blood... \nNow from BRADLEE-- \nCUT TO: \nHUGH SLOAN \nholding a broom and dustpan at his front door. \nSLOAN I really can't talk now-- \nBERNSTEIN --this'll only take one second-- \nSLOAN --my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape. \nWOODWARD A boy or a girl? \nSLOAN A girl. Melissa. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE HOUSE. WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN are helping SLOAN with the housework. WOODWARD has a dust mop, BERNSTEIN a dust cloth. We are mostly in the living room throughout, and also throughout, the three guys beaver away tidying. \nWOODWARD (holding up a cup) Where does this go? \nSLOAN points to a shelf. WOODWARD moves to put the cup in its proper place. \nWOODWARD --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control-- \nBERNSTEIN (ticking them off) --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach-- \nWOODWARD --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman. \nSLOAN --I'm not your source on that-- \nBERNSTEIN --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved-- \nWOODWARD --and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President. \nSLOAN No, none of those. \nBERNSTEIN --that leaves Haldeman, period. \nSLOAN I'm not your source on that. \nHe picks up a dust pan, starts sweeping it full. \nWOODWARD (taking the dust pan, helping out) --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names? \nSLOAN Of course--everything they asked-- \nBERNSTEIN --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?-- \nSLOAN --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did. \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN look at each other while SLOAN empties the dust pan into the trash and from there, quickly-- \nCUT TO: \nA LONG LONG LONG SHOT OF A COUPLE \nwalking in the park. \nWe can't really make them out clearly, we never do in this little sequence. But the guy is wearing a windbreaker and has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually too. He has his arm around her, and they are deep in conversation. \nWOODWARD'S VOICE (V.O.) Hey? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sitting on a park bench swilling down a six-pack. \nWOODWARD I think that's him. \nThey nod. \nBRADLEE --Bernstein, are you sure on this story? \nBERNSTEIN Absolutely-- \nBRADLEE (to WOODWARD) --what about you?-- \nWOODWARD --I'm sure-- \nBRADLEE --I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- (looks at SIMONS) \nSIMONS (to WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, after a puse) --get another source. \nNow quickly \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN huddling outside BRADLEE's office. \nBERNSTEIN How many fucking sources they think we got?-- \nWOODWARD --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman. \nBERNSTEIN I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. (looks at WOODWARD) \nWOODWARD --We got twenty minutes to deadline-- \nAnd as he speaks \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN talking softly from a relatively private phone in the newsroom. The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death. \nLAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.) (barely audible) ...You shouldn't ever call me like this, Carl... \nBERNSTEIN Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury? \nLAWYER'S VOICE (O.S.) ...I won't say anything about Haldeman... not ever... \nBERNSTEIN (desperate) All right--listen--it's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don't have to say a thing--I'll count to ten--if the story's wrong, hang up before I get there--if it's OK stay on the line till after, got it? \nLAWYER (O.S.) Hang up, right? \nBERNSTEIN Right, right--OK, counting: one, two-- (he inhales deeply) --three, four, five, six-- (now he's starting to get excited) --seven, eight-- (inhales deeply) --nine, ten, thank you. \nLAWYER (O.S.) You've got it straight now? Everything OK? \nBERNSTEIN (on a note of triumph) Yeah! \nAnd on that shout \nCUT TO: \nA HEADLINE IN THE POST--A PHOTO VISIBLE OF HALDEMAN: \n\"TESTIMONY TIES TOP NIXON AIDE TO SECRET FUND\" \nCUT TO: \nTHE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN \nWHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN On the record let me say just this: the story is totally untrue. On background, I'd like to add that Bob Haldeman is one of the greatest public servants this country has ever had and the story is a goddamned lie. \nNOW FAST ZOOM TO: \nBRADLEE \nroaring out of his office doorway. \nBRADLEE Woodstein! \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN tearing into BRADLEE's office--he stands scowling at the TV set in a corner of the room-- outside, it is raining like hell. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TV SET. SLOAN is walking along toward a large office building, he is flanked by a lawyer. A TV Reporter (it was DANIEL SCHORR) is walking alongside, mike in hand. \nSCHORR Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on your testimony before the Grand Jury. \nSLOAN My lawyer says-- \nSLOAN'S LAWYER --the answer is an unequivocal no. Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They look sick. Desperate, tired, stunned, confused; there is nothing to say. \nBERNSTEIN'S VOICE (O.S.) What'd you find? \nWOODWARD Jesus Christ, what time is it? \nBERNSTEIN You overslept? \nWOODWARD Goddamnit!-- \nHe fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a CRASH-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD--MOVING. Hair wild, clothes half-buttoned, he runs through the dark Washington streets as we \nCUT TO: \nTWO WELL-DRESSED MEN in the shadows across the street, going in the same direction and \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD spotting them, picking up the pace and \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO MEN moving faster too and now \nCUT TO: \nA BUNCH OF CABS. WOODWARD jumps into the first and as it roars off \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO MEN getting into a cab also, roaring off in the same direction and \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD'S CAB taking a corner fast and as it goes on, HOLD until the second cab takes the same corner, faster, and now \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD jumping out of his cab, fumbling into his pockets for change as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO MEN getting out of their cab, paying, and as their cab drives off \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD diving back into his cab and in a moment it is roaring again through the night and we \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN standing on the sidewalk, watching as WOODWARD disappears into the night and then suddenly, \nZOOM TO: \nDEEP THROAT IN CLOSE UP AND MAD. \nDEEP THROAT --you were doing so well and then you got stupid, you went too fast-- Christ, what a royal screw up-- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nDEEP THROAT and WOODWARD in the underground garage. \nWOODWARD --I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post-- \nDEEP THROAT --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months. \nWOODWARD We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong? \nDEEP THROAT You'll have to find that out, won't you?-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD exploding. \nWOODWARD --I'm tired of your chickenshit games-- I don't want hints, I want what you know! \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT. He blinks for a moment. Then he begins to whisper. \nDEEP THROAT It was a Haldeman operation--the whole business--he ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how-- \nWOODWARD takes a breath, nods. \nDEEP THROAT --wait-- (almost a smile) --there's more... \nAnd from his weathered face \n", "test1_input": "WOODWARD Thanks, anyway. \nAnd he's about to hang up again when-- \nSECRETARY (V.O.) Have you tried Mullen and Company Public Relations? He works at Mullen and Company Public Relations as a writer. The number is 555-1313. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. \nWOODWARD Listen, forget it. \nHe hangs up, sits there. His hands are a little twitchy... HOLD. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office. WOODWARD, looking for something in his desk throughout this scene, speaks to him. \nWOODWARD Who's Charles Colson? \nROSENFELD (stops dead) I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, \"I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?\" \nWOODWARD Who's Colson, Harry? \nROSENFELD The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name. \nWOODWARD, unfazed by anything, continues to open drawers, close them, as ROSENFELD rolls on. \nROSENFELD The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel. \nWOODWARD (rising) Thanks, Harry. (looks at ROSENFELD) Know anything about Colson? \nROSENFELD Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, \"When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow.\" \nWOODWARD nods, heads back toward the files as we \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AT HIS DESK dialing the phone. \nHe's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures of the man and articles the Post had done on him. But basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are continuous. \nWOODWARD Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and... (beat) Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? (surprised) He is? \nHUNT (V.O.) Howard Hunt here. \nWOODWARD Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and-- \nHUNT (V.O.) (impatient) --yes, yes, what is it? \nWOODWARD I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate? \nHUNT (V.O.) (blind panic) Good God! \nAnd he bangs the phone down sharply-- \n--more dialing SOUNDS. Now snatches of conversation-- \nWOODWARD I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt. \nBENNETT (V.O.) Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the C.I.A. \nWOODWARD (he hadn't known) No secret at all. \nMore dialing. Then-- \nWOODWARD (tired, voice deeper) Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel-- \nDialing again. WOODWARD's voice is showing genuine fatigue. \nWOODWARD Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that?--you've never heard of me?--I can't help that--you don't believe I'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout \"extra--extra\"? \nThere is the SOUND of the phone being slammed down in his ear. Hard. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD AND SIMONS approaching WOODWARD who is working at his desk. He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it. \nROSENFELD Whaddya got, whaddya got? \nWOODWARD Hunt is Colson's man-- (to SIMONS, explaining) --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- (SIMONS almost says something, decides against it) --they both went to Brown University-- (consulting his notes) --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in. \nSIMONS What else have you got? \nWOODWARD According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. (reading) \"I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee.\" \nHe looks up at them. \nSIMONS Isn't that what you'd expect them to say? \nWOODWARD Absolutely. \nROSENFELD So? \n", "test1_true": "ROSENFELD (to SIMONS) I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging. \nSIMONS (nods) Just be careful how you write it. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD TYPING LIKE MAD, makes a mistake, corrects it, types on muttering to himself, and-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE munching a handful of Maalox tablets and-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD taking a sheet from his typewriter, hurrying off and-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD taking the sheet from WOODWARD-- \nWOODWARD Here's the first take-- \nROSENFELD nods, shows him out and-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD BACK AT HIS MACHINE typing faster then before, makes another mistake, starts to correct it, glances around and-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE gesturing to somebody but not WOODWARD and-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD watching as BERNSTEIN appears in view from behind the wide pillar by WOODWARD's desk, heads toward ROSENFELD's office. WOODWARD shrugs, goes back to his typing, makes a typo immediately, glances over toward ROSENFELD's office, freezes as we-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD handing some papers to BERNSTEIN. They look, from this distance, suspiciously like WOODWARD's story. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN hurrying out of ROSENFELD's office, and-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD watching BERNSTEIN until he disappears out of sight behind the pillar. WOODWARD hesitates, finally goes back to his typing, makes another mistake, fixes it, makes still another, his temper is shortly to make itself known-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD as WOODWARD hands him another sheet of paper. \nWOODWARD This is all of it, Harry. \nROSENFELD NODS, takes it, immediately starts to read as we-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AT HIS DESK watching as ROSENFELD gestures again. There is a pause. Then BERNSTEIN appears from behind the pillar and-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD handing BERNSTEIN another sheet of paper. BERSTEIN nods, takes it, walks back toward his desk, disappears behind the pillar again. WOODWARD is starting to steam. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK typing magnificently, his hands rising and falling like Rubinstein's. Behind him is the pillar and for a moment there is nothing--then, very slowly, a figure peers out from behind the pillar--it is WOODWARD. \nHe watches. BERNSTEIN continues to type, then after a moment, rests, thinks, shifts around in his chair and as his glance starts toward the pillar-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE PILLAR. WOODWARD is gone. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN typing madly away. \nTHE PILLAR. WOODWARD is visible again, eyes very bright... now-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN finishing typing, his hands moving majestically. WOODWARD comes up behind him, stands looking a second. \nThen-- \nWOODWARD We have to talk. \nBERNSTEIN nods, grabs the papers both that he's been typing and that he's been copying from. \n", "test1_id": 1719, "test2_input": "He hangs up. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN watching from phone booth as the SECRETARY hurries across the hallway. As we see her open the door of the clerk's office, BERNSTEIN bolts out of the phone booth and runs into the reception room heading straight for the SECRETARY's desk. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN at her desk, looking at the telephone console, receiver in hand. He punches the button marked Intercom and we can hear it BUZZ somewhere. \nVOICE (V.O.) Dardis. \nBERNSTEIN Carl Bernstein's here to see you--I don't know why, but he seems angry-- \nCUT TO: \nDARDIS emerging through one of the doors behind BERNSTEIN. BERNSTEIN see him. \nBERNSTEIN (to DARDIS) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so. \nDARDIS Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow? \nBERNSTEIN (headshake) I'm on deadline. \nCUT TO: \nDARDIS' OFFICE. He is fiddling with a combination lock at a filing cabinet. BERNSTEIN is seated across DARDIS' desk. \nDARDIS You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff? \nBERNSTEIN Whatever. \nHe hands BERNSTEIN some papers, glances at his watch. \nDARDIS I'll never get out of here in time. \nBERNSTEIN (flying through what he's been handed) The telephone calls... we know about that. \nDARDIS The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks-- \nBERNSTEIN --yeah, that was in The Times this morning. \nBERNSTEIN continues to fly through the papers. \nBERNSTEIN (continuing stops) What's this Dahlberg check? \nAnd as it's mentioned-- \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP--CASHIER'S CHECK. It's drawn on the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10 and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to Kenneth H. Dahlberg. \nDARDIS' VOICE That the twenty-five grand one?-- Don't know-- \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN starting to copy the check in a meticulous facsimile. DARDIS watches. \nDARDIS I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. (watching BERNSTEIN) Think it might be anything? \nBERNSTEIN (casually) This? (shrugs) Naw... \nAnd from here quickly-- \nZOOM TO: \nBERNSTEIN IN A PHONE BOOTH in the lobby of the Justice Building. Wildly excited-- \nBERNSTEIN --Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't know what I got-- (holding the Dahlberg facsimile) --and I think the Times has it too-- (big) --but somewhere there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him-- \nAnd now comes \nTHE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG. \nThis is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names DAHLBERG. \nWOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating, surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities-- \nBERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building, sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away. \nThis took them hours, and that effort should be visible to us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point is, we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount of time, but we also want people to know there was effort involved. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD, bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a researcher librarian type. \nRESEARCHER Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files? (WOODWARD nods) There aren't any, sorry. \nAnd now she drops a piece of paper, a photo-- \n", "test2_true": "RESEARCHER (shrugs) Our Dahlberg file. \nAs she leaves-- \nCUT TO: \nThe photo. \nIt is a picture of Hubert Humphrey standing next to another man. The caption identifies that other man as KENNETH DAHLBERG. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AT HIS DESK. \nThe room is reasonably quiet. ROSENFELD is visible in his office. As WOODWARD picks up the phone, gets Minneapolis information-- \nCUT TO: \nROSENFELD'S PHONE RINGING. He hurries in, grabs it. \nBERNSTEIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Harry--I know how to get Dahlberg-- \nROSENFELD --Woodward's talking to him know. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN, drenched. There are no dimes left. He listens a moment more, then nods, hangs up, leans back against the glass, takes a deep breath, closes his eyes as we \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD on the phone. \nWOODWARD --this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- (pause) --and I was kind of curious about your check. \nDAHLBERG (V.O.) ...check...? \nWOODWARD The twenty-five thousand dollar one. (silence) The one with your name on it. (silence) In Bernard Barker's Florida account. (still nothing) Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar-- \nDAHLBERG (V.O.) (struggling) ...you're definitely doing a story...? \nWOODWARD Yes, sir. \nDAHLBERG (V.O.) I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. (WOODWARD waits, pen ready; tense as hell) I know I shouldn't tell you this... \nWOODWARD's lips are going \"tell me, tell me.\" \nDAHLBERG (V.O.) That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign. \nWOODWARD I see. And how do you think it reached Miami? \nDAHLBERG (V.O.) I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine. \nWOODWARD (trying to keep his voice level) That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg. \nCUT TO: \nAN ARTICLE WITH WOODWARD'S NAME ON THE BYLINE. \nROSENFELD holds it. \nROSENFELD CREEP financed the Watergate break- in, Jesus Christ. \nHe starts off. \nWOODWARD One sec'-- \nWOODWARD takes the story, scrawls BERNSTEIN's name in front of his on the byline. ROSENFELD watches. As WOODWARD finishes, he takes the story again, hurries off. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE HEADLINE OF THEIR STORY: \n\"Campaign Funds Found in Watergate Burglar's Account.\" \nNow-- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nthat it isn't exactly a gigantic headline piece. As a matter of fact, as more and more of page one appears, we see that their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and bigger headlines are visible-- \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \n--the whole first page. Plastered across the top in giant letters is the following: \"EAGLETON RESIGNS.\" And as you look at the whole page now, you can barely make out the tiny piddling Watergate story. The point is abundantly clear: nobody cared a whole lot. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TRIANGLE \nbeing rung like crazy. And as it SOUNDS-- \n", "test2_id": 1720, "test3_input": "AN ELEVATOR, the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises. 4--5--6-- WOODWARD stands alone in the elevator. As it reaches seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and \nCUT TO: \nTHE MARRIOTT SUITE. It's numbered 710. WOODWARD approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks on the door nearest him. Now 710 is wide open and several maids leave, watched by a large black man. \nFIRST MAID We'll be back after lunch. \nBLACK MAN (it's the voice from the phone) We'll be here. \nWOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes. The maids look at him a moment. He knocks again, louder. \nSECOND MAID I think they went out. \nWOODWARD (shrugs) I don't mind waiting. \nThe maids nod, move out of sight. WOODWARD stands tense and still, watching the closed door numbered 710... Now-- \nCUT TO: \nNATIONAL AIRPORT IN D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON. \nPeople are getting off the shuttle, WOODWARD among them. BERNSTEIN waits. \nBERNSTEIN (as WOODWARD reaches him) See her? (WOODWARD nods) Get anything? \nWOODWARD For the paper, no; for us, plenty. (The two of them head for the terminal) I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile. \nBERNSTEIN And?--And?-- \nWOODWARD (looks at BERNSTEIN) --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell. \nBERNSTEIN Were you eyebrow reading? \nWOODWARD (shakes his head \"no\") It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...? \nThey look at each other, neither has a clue. HOLD. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE RED KARMANN GHIA \nmoving along a residential area in Washington. It's later that night. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE CAR - NIGHT. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN driving along. \nBERNSTEIN Left up ahead. \nWOODWARD nods. \nWOODWARD Who's first? \nBERNSTEIN Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street. \nAs WOODWARD turns left. \nBERNSTEIN Now hang your second right-- (explaining) --this was my turf when I was a kid. \nAnd on those words-- \nCUT TO: \nA DEAD END SIGN. We hear BERNSTEIN explaining-- \nBERNSTEIN (V.O.) I brought you over one street too many--go back and hang a left again. \nNow on those words-- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER DEAD END SIGN. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pulled over to one side. BERNSTEIN, baffled, stares around; WOODWARD looks at a map with the aid of a flashlight. \nBERNSTEIN I don't get it... this really was my turf... \nWOODWARD (concentrating on the map) You're not a kid anymore. \nBERNSTEIN (shaking his head) My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, \"My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow.\" (WOODWARD is getting interested in the story now) And I said, \"Am I supposed to do that?\" and he said, \"Absolutely, it's crucial.\" So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, \"What the fuck do you think you're doing?\" And I said, \"It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper.\" (BERNSTEIN looks at WOODWARD) Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all. \nWOODWARD goes back to his map. BERNSTEIN continues to smoke, staring around at the night. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD - AT THE FRONT OF A HOUSE. A sweet old lady is looking out at him. \n", "test3_true": "SWEET OLD LADY --I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription. \nWOODWARD No, I'm a reporter.

This time both WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are there. \nWOODWARD Miss Abbott? \nMISS ABBOTT Yes? \nWOODWARD We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee. \nZOOM TO: \nCLOSE UP - MISS ABBOTT \nMISS ABBOTT I'm sorry-- \nAnd from nowhere, suddenly she bursts into tears. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as her door slams in their faces. \nThey just look at each other, bewildered. And a little bit upset; their upset increases as the rejections go on. \nCUT TO: \nWHOLE SERIES OF FACES \nin quick succession--they're all in various doorways, men, women, young, old. The only thing in common is their fear. \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN (literally trembling) God, it's just so awful-- \nAnd as he closes the door \nCUT TO: \nA YOUNG GIRL --I can't--I'd like to but-- (that's all she'll say) \nAnd as her door starts to shut \nCUT TO: \nOLD MAN --go--you've got to go before they see you--please-- \nAnd as he almost starts to beg \nCUT TO: \nOLD WOMAN --no... good... \nShe stands there, shaking her head back and forth, back and forth, pathetic and sad. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD. \nHe is seated alone staring at his coffee cup, surrounded by junk food debris. We are in a Hot Shoppe, it's night, and as BERNSTEIN comes up with food, they're dressed differently from before. BERNSTEIN puts more junk food and coffee down. \nBERNSTEIN You had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right? (WOODWARD shrugs) \nBERNSTEIN passes over some food. They both look bleary and in foul moods. Silently, they start to eat, something they continue doing throughout. They're not hungry, they just eat. \nWOODWARD This is terrific work, if you like rejection. \nBERNSTEIN I never scared anyone before. \nWOODWARD It's not us, they were scared before we got there. (looks at BERNSTEIN) What do we know? \nBERNSTEIN Facts or theory? \nWOODWARD Anything you've got. \nBERNSTEIN We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked. \nWOODWARD And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down.

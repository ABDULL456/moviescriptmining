{"test1_input": "CUT TO: \nA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN-- \n--kind of an honest, hard-working face. \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are standing in her doorway. \nWOODWARD A friend at the Committee told us to contact you-- \nWOMAN --who was it? \nBERNSTEIN We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us. \nWOODWARD It's safe, try it, you'll see. \nShe doesn't talk at first, but she doesn't slam the door either. \nBERNSTEIN We understand your problem-- \nWOODWARD --you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal. \nBERNSTEIN We appreciate your position--really. \nAnd now she starts, at last, to talk, and they expect it to be their first breakthrough, but when it turns out to be the most withering onslaught yet, they are stunned. \nWOMAN You people--you think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out. (to BERNSTEIN) You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, mister. (to WOODWARD) And you don't understand nothing. (voice rising) But the Committee's briefed us on you--so get the hell out of here-- (big) --do you like scaring the life out of decent people?--'cause if you don't, in the name of God--stop it! \nAnd she slams the door-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, slowly walking back in silence back to the car. \nWOODWARD At Yale once, they held an auction. There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and I'd never heard of her before but I knew I had to have those cards, I had to know why anyone would get so many messages. I paid sixty-five dollars for them... I got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then I found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once I had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed. Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards, they were her eyes... \nThey continue to walk; slowly. \nCUT TO: \nA MIDDLE-AGED MAN--IN HIS DOORWAY \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN I know who you are and I'm not afraid but that don't mean I'll talk to you either--you're just a couple Democrats out to stop Nixon getting re-elected. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, staring at the man. \nWOODWARD Democrats? \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN That's right. \nBERNSTEIN I hate both parties. \nWOODWARD And I'm a Republican. \nThe middle-aged man looks at him. \nBERNSTEIN (surprised, turns to WOODWARD) Republican? \nWOODWARD Sure. \nBERNSTEIN Who'd you vote for? \nWOODWARD When? \nBERNSTEIN \nWOODWARD Nixon. \nBERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we-- \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER SERIES OF CREEP EMPLOYEES. \nOnly they aren't slamming doors, they're sitting in various rooms of their houses and apartments. We don't see the reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive make it self-evident. We start with the middle-aged man seen above. \nMIDDLE-AGED MAN Mitchell never left the Committee-- he resigned, sure, but he was there as much as before-- \nCUT TO: \nYOUNGER MAN --oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it's not that Gordon's crazy, he's... (pauses, looking for the right word) ...weird. I'll give you some Committee people who know about him--only don't tell it was me-- \nCUT TO: \nYOUNGER WOMAN --of course we were briefed on what to say--and never to volunteer anything-- \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "Smiles, talks on as we-- \nCUT TO: \nRICHARD NIXON'S SOMBER VISAGE. \nNIXON ...No one in this administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nBERNSTEIN and WOODWARD in a crummy cafeteria, watching the evening news on the TV set high on the wall. WOODWARD eats a hamburger, BERNSTEIN smokes, sips coffee. It is night, as usual now. \nCUT TO: \nNIXON--on the tube. \nNIXON ...What really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong. What really hurts is if you try to cover it up. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as the news commentator come on, begins introducing another story. \nWOODWARD Did he just say what I think he said? \nBERNSTEIN You voted for him. \nHe gives WOODWARD a big smile. WOODWARD eats his hamburger in silence... \nCUT TO: \nA DIFFERENT TIME, A DIFFERENT PLACE--EARLY EVENING. \nBERNSTEIN gets out of his car, walks up, and knocks on the door of a small tract house in the D.C. suburbs. A woman opens the door. \nBERNSTEIN Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and-- \nWOMAN --oh, you don't want me, you want my sister. (calls out) For you. \nAnd we-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOOKKEEPER approaching the door. She's younger than the clich\u00e9 version of a bookkeeper. As she looks at her sister-- \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER This here is Carl Bernstein-- \nBOOKKEEPER --omigod, you're from that place, you've got to go. \nThe sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette table. \nBERNSTEIN Could I bum one of your cigarettes?-- \nAs the sister starts for the pack-- \nBERNSTEIN --don't bother, I'll get it. \nAnd he crosses ten feet inside the front door. \nBOOKKEEPER You've really got to go. \nBERNSTEIN Just let me get a match. \nHe goes into the living room area, picks up a book of matches. This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it-- it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here. \nBERNSTEIN But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through. \nBOOKKEEPER All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff? \nBERNSTEIN We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax. \nBOOKKEEPER (tense) I'm relaxed--light your cigarette. \nBERNSTEIN lights the cigarette. \nBERNSTEIN You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse? \nBOOKKEEPER I never worked for Sloan or Stans. \nBOOKKEEPER'S SISTER (out of the blue; to BERNSTEIN) Would you like some coffee or anything? \nAs the BOOKKEEPER winces. \nBERNSTEIN (like a shot) Please, yes, thank you. (he looks at the BOOKKEEPER) Can I sit down for a minute? \nHe is by a couch. \nBOOKKEEPER One minute but then-- \nBERNSTEIN --right, right, I've got to go. (he sits) Why did you lie just then? \n", "test1_id": 1719, "test2_input": "SLOAN I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial. \nWOODWARD You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done-- \nBERNSTEIN --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written-- \nSLOAN --they're worse. That's why I quit. \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN wait as SLOAN is clearly going through a struggle with himself. Then-- \nSLOAN Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of. \nBERNSTEIN Do you think the truth will come out at the trial? \nSLOAN That's another of the things I'm not so sure of. \nBERNSTEIN Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors? \nSLOAN We were never told flat out \"Don't talk.\" But the message was clear. \nBERNSTEIN To cover up? \nSLOAN Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth. \nWOODWARD Does \"they\" mean the White House? \nSLOAN As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that. \nWOODWARD The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true? \nSLOAN No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand. \nWOODWARD And as treasurer, you could release those funds? \nSLOAN (nods) When so ordered. \nWOODWARD We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. (SLOAN is silent) \nBERNSTEIN (ticking them off) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're obvious-- \nSLOAN stirs his coffee. \nWOODWARD --there had to be a White House overseer-- \nBERNSTEIN --Colson. \nSLOAN Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that. \nWOODWARD (to BERNSTEIN) Haldeman. (to SLOAN) Right? \nSLOAN I won't talk about the other two. \nBERNSTEIN But they both worked at the White House? \nSLOAN (softly) I will not talk about the other two. \nBERNSTEIN (out of the blue) Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer. \nSLOAN is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach. \nSLOAN I can't say anything, I'm sorry. (He starts to rise) \nWOODWARD One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work? \nSLOAN Badly. (and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it. \nBERNSTEIN Right. \nSLOAN Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed. \nWOODWARD Go on. \nSLOAN Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story. \nBERNSTEIN Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure? \nSLOAN Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say \"go ahead, give out the money.\" \nWOODWARD and BERNSTEIN just look at each other--they hadn't known it, not remotely. SLOAN stands and as they head for the door-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE THREE OF THEM heading across the foyer. \nBERNSTEIN What happens when the baby comes? \nSLOAN We're moving. (beat) I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "SLOAN I wish I could put down on paper what it's like--you come to Washington because you believe in something, and then you get inside and you see how things actually work and you watch your ideals disintegrate. (beat) The people inside, the people in the White House, they start to believe they can suspend the rules because they're fulfilling a mission. That becomes the only important thing-- the mission. It's so easy to lose perspective. We want to get out before we lose ours altogether. \nSLOAN opens the front door. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pause, nod, almost an embarrassed pause. Then as they hurry out into the rain-- \nCUT TO: \nA NERFBALL \nflying toward a basket cupped to a picture window. When we \nPULL BACK \nwe're in BRADLEE's office, SIMONS and ROSENFELD are also there, along with WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. BRADLEE plays nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention span. \nBERNSTEIN Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach. \nWOODWARD We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it. \nBRADLEE This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. (looks at them) You're certain on Mitchell? \nWOODWARD He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General-- \nAnd all this now goes fast-- \nROSENFELD --you got more than one source?-- \nBERNSTEIN --yes-- \nSIMONS --has any of them got an ax?-- \nROSENFELD --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?-- \nWOODWARD --no-- \nSIMONS --can we use their names?-- \nBERNSTEIN --no-- \nBRADLEE --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story-- \nROSENFELD --who you got?-- \nWOODWARD --well, Sloan-- \nBERNSTEIN --and we got a guy in Justice-- \nBRADLEE --Deep Throat?-- \nWOODWARD --I saw him. He verifies. \nBRADLEE OK. (now after the burst of talk, a pause) You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook. (throws the nerfball) Just be right, huh? \nAs WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN leave the office-- \nBRADLEE Leave plenty of room for his denial. \nCUT TO: \nBERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK ON THE PHONE. He has some papers in front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand. He is tired and very, very nervous. It is dark outside. In what follows, BERNSTEIN takes notes. \nOPERATOR'S VOICE (V.O.) Essex House, can I help you? \nBERNSTEIN John Mitchell, please. \nThere is a BUZZING SOUND. Then-- \nJOHN MITCHELL'S VOICE (V.O.) Yes? \nBERNSTEIN Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and I'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment on. \nMITCHELL (V.O.) What does it say? \nBERNSTEIN (starting to read) John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --almost a year before he left the Justice Department-- \nMITCHELL (V.O.) --jeeeeeeeeesus-- \nBERNSTEIN --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund-- \n", "test2_id": 1720, "test3_input": "BERNSTEIN Chapin did contact you then? \nSEGRETTI Sure--off the record. \nBERNSTEIN On the orders of Haldeman? \nSEGRETTI I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls. \nBERNSTEIN It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President. \nSEGRETTI Can't help you. \nBERNSTEIN At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. (SEGRETTI half-smiles, nods) Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all? \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP--SEGRETTI staring at the girls and the blue water. \nSEGRETTI What would you have done if you were just getting out of the Army, if you'd been away from the real world for four years, if you weren't sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the President of the United States...? \nHOLD on the question, then-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN \nback in D.C., walking through the airport. \nBERNSTEIN What would you have done? \nWOODWARD You asking would I have been one of the President's men? (beat) I would have been. \nAs they continue on-- \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD \nalone in the underground garage. Tense, jumpy. He looks at his watch, paces around. It's all eerie as hell. Then, from the ramps, footsteps. \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT moving out of the shadows, smoking, as always. \nDEEP THROAT My turn to keep you waiting. (approaches) What's the topic for tonight? \nWOODWARD Ratfucking. \nDEEP THROAT In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats. \nWOODWARD I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House. \nDEEP THROAT (nods) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government. \nWOODWARD Who?--be specific. How high up? \nDEEP THROAT You'll have to find that out, won't you. \nWOODWARD The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so-- \nHe stops as suddenly DEEP THROAT dives down behind the nearest car. \nWOODWARD dropping beside him. \nWOODWARD What? \nDEEP THROAT Did you change cabs? (as WOODWARD nods) It didn't work, something moved there-- \nAnd as he points \nCUT TO: \nTHE SHADOWS BY THE RAMP. You can't see a goddamn thing. But there is the SOUND, faint but distinct, of breathing. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD standing, staring into the darkness. He is scared, wipes his mouth. He doesn't move for a moment. Then he walks directly into the darkness and as he's gone-- \nZOOM TO: \nA HORRID FACE IN CLOSE UP, red eyed, unshaven, beaten--there are half-formed scabs and cuts. He is leaning against a wall, shivering. He looks, for all the world, like a perpetual drunk. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD in the shadows, coming closer. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUNK. He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth. He watches WOODWARD approach. \n", "test3_true": "WOODWARD coming still closer. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUNK. He blinks very slowly now.

Nothing, no reaction. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD studying the other man. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUNK. And he blinks again, then slowly, shivering, begins sliding down the wall. WOODWARD reaches for him, holds him up. \nCUT TO: \nWOODWARD managing to get out his wallet, take out some bills. He starts up the ramp with the drunk, and as they disappear up the ramp out of sight, he gives the drunk the money. \nWOODWARD Here. (softly) Forget your troubles and just be happy. \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT pacing and smoking. He is visibly upset; scared maybe. He glances over as WOODWARD comes back down the ramp alone. \nDEEP THROAT (self-mocking) I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery. \nWOODWARD (impatiently) Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it? \nDEEP THROAT They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it. \nWOODWARD Why didn't they?--who told them not to? \nDEEP THROAT Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? (coughs) Don't you know what you're onto? Come on. \nWOODWARD Mitchell knew then. \nDEEP THROAT Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman. \nWOODWARD Haldeman too? \nDEEP THROAT You get nothing from me about Haldeman? \nAnd from this tone, you know HALDEMAN scares him. \nWOODWARD Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after? \nDEEP THROAT Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines. \nWOODWARD Talk about Segretti-- \nDEEP THROAT --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too. \nWOODWARD There were more then. \nDEEP THROAT Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere-- \nWOODWARD --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation-- \nDEEP THROAT (nods, bigger) --don't you miss the grand scheme too. \nWOODWARD How grand? \nDEEP THROAT Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti. \nWOODWARD And Justice and FBI know all this? \nDEEP THROAT Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief. \nWOODWARD (stunned) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats? \nCUT TO: \nDEEP THROAT \nDEEP THROAT I was being cautious.

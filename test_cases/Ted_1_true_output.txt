O.S. VOICE Excuse me. 
John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground. 
ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man. 
DONNY I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I couldn't help but admire your teddy bear. 
ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat young Donny from earlier. 
JOHN (a little uncomfortable) Oh. Um, thank you. 
DONNY I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert. I have to tell you, I've been fascinated by your story ever since I was a boy. I remember seeing you on the Carson show. You were just wonderful. 
BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED Yeah, that was ah... that was a good time. 
DONNY (TO JOHN) I wonder, is there any chance I could purchase the bear from you? For my son? 
JOHN/TED Huh? / Excuse me? 
ROBERT (CALM) I want it. 
TED Hey, I'm not an "it", pal. I'm a "he." 
JOHN (leaning down to his level) I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me. 
ROBERT Sit up straight when you talk to me. 
JOHN (RECOILING) Ew, why the fuck did he say that? 
DONNY Don't swear in front of my child. Now. We are very interested in the bear. If you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone number. 
He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet. 
JOHN Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff. 
Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a glance back at Ted as they move off. 
TED Wow. Can you imagine what that little shit would do to me? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme. 
John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out. He then breaks into a creepy falsetto. 
JOHN (CONT'D) OH, MY LITTLE SIXPENCE/MY PRETTY LITTLE SIXPENCE/I LOVE MY SIXPENCE BETTER THAN MY LIFE. 
TED Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for that. C'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned. 
They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree. 
EXT. ESTAB. A SHITTY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
John and Ted walk into the building. John carries two cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one. 
INT. AN ALMOST EMPTY APARTMENT - SAME 
There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes. John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside the doorway. JOHN Well... I guess this is it, huh? 
TED Yeah, sure is. 
JOHN First night on your own. 
TED Yeah. First night in my beautiful new apartment. They say they're ain't hardly been no murders here. 
They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John must leave soon. 
JOHN Okay... so... if you need anything... (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TED I know. 
JOHN Seriously, anything... 
TED I know. I'll be fine, Johnny. 
JOHN (BEAT) I know you will, buddy. 
They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive- looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as the camera recedes. 
INT. JOHN AND LORI'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

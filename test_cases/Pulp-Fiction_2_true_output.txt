We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. 
VINCENT So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do? 
JULES That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth. 
VINCENT What do you mean, walk the earth? 
JULES You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures. 
VINCENT How long do you intend to walk the earth? 
JULES Until God puts me where he want me to be. 
VINCENT What if he never does? 
JULES If it takes forever, I'll wait forever. 
VINCENT So you decided to be a bum? 
JULES I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no more, no less. 
VINCENT No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be  a fuckin' bum! 
JULES Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ  
VINCENT  what happened was peculiar  no doubt about it  but it wasn't water into wine. 
JULES All shapes and sizes, Vince. 
VINCENT Stop fuckin' talkin' like that! 
JULES If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions. 
VINCENT I gotta take a shit. To be continued. 
Vincent exits for the restroom. 
Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised. 
PUMPKIN Everybody be cool, this is a robbery! 
HONEY BUNNY Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?! 
Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING IT. 
PUMPKIN Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor. 
HONEY BUNNY Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die! 
Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified. 
PUMPKIN You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!  Asta luego! 
Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen. 
PUMPKIN On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende? 
They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up. 
MANAGER I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all  
Pumpkin heads his way. 
PUMPKIN You're gonna give me a problem? 
He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the Manager's neck. 
PUMPKIN What? You said you're gonna give me a problem? 
MANAGER No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem! 
PUMPKIN I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me! 
HONEY BUNNY Don't take any chances. Execute him! 
The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table. 
MANAGER Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want. 
PUMPKIN Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over. 
MANAGER Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon! 
PUMPKIN Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING 
Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING 
Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand. 
PUMPKIN Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear? 
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table. 
Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.

The Ice Storm by James Schamus. Based on the novel by Rick Moody. First Draft Revised January 5, 1996 
EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN 
Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from the track. 
INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN 
Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep. 
On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign. 
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns. 
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice. 
CONDUCTOR Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- 
He sounds like a baseball announcer. 
PASSENGERS (mumbling, ad lib) What ladies? 
CONDUCTOR -- this train originating at New York's Grand Central Station is back in service - next stop will be New Canaan, Connecticut. New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop! 
He moves on to the next car. 
The train begins to move. 
Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still-dark early morning. 
He looks back down at his comic book. 
On the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. 
The Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look on, stunned. "THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A VEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON." "DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WQRLD!" 
Paul looks up again, thinking. 
PAUL (V.O.) In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb. His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter. 
EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN 
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape. 
PAUL (V.O.) And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely. Each of them is negative matter for the other ones. And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space... 
INT. TRAIN. CONT'D. 
On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic book. 
PAUL (V.O.) So it's a paradox -- the closer you're drawn back in, the further into the void you're thrown. 
EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING 
The train slowly pulls in. 
The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night, emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen suburban Lolita. 
He pauses, regarding them. 
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him. 
EXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING 
To establish. A typical New England prep school. 
INT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING 
Cramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money. 
Paul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong. 
FRANCIS Arise and shine, young Hood. 
PAUL I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night. 
FRANCIS (finishing a hit) The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick. 
Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs, spewing uninhaled smoke.

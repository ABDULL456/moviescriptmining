They gaze at each other for a moment. Norrington looks away. 
NORRINGTON You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard. 
ELIZABETH Then I can wear men's clothing. 
NORRINGTON That would hardly be proper. 
ELIZABETH Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage! 
Norrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin - this is exactly why he loves her. She grins back at him - she's not going to change. 
NORRINGTON Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt. 
Elizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away. Norrington watches her go ... then turns his gaze to the sea. 
INT. THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY 
Pintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs. 
PINTEL That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea 
Will drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly: 
WILL What happened to William Turner? 
PINTEL Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure -- to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain. 
WILL And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him. 
PINTEL That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over. 
Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate. 
PINTEL (CONT'D) Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker. (sighs) It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse. That's what you call ironic. 
Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then: 
BARBOSSA Bring him. 
EXT. H. M.. S.. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING 
Jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at the sea. Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to excellent effect, joins him. 
ELIZABETH You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything. 
JACK Nor did you, I noticed. 
ELIZABETH He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late. 
JACK Exactly. 
ELIZABETH These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed. 
JACK I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided. 
ELIZABETH What's your plan? 
LOOKOUT (O.S.) LAND HO! 
Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon. 
NORRINGTON Elizabeth -- below decks. I will not compromise your safety.. 
She starts to speak; he turns away.. 
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there. 
Norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. Jack watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away. 
NORRINGTON (CONT'D) I don't like the situation, mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage. 
JACK Funny, I was thinking   along those lines. How about you let me   go in alone, and while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out   to you. 
NORRINGTON You would do that? 
JACK They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose? 
NORRINGTON (looks at him) Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of. 
JACK (smiles) I knew you'd listen to reason! 
EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING 
Torches are lit. Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and a band of pirates, into the caves. 
EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
A long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side. Jack wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch. 
JACK That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is. 
NORRINGTON I'll be at the wheel myself.

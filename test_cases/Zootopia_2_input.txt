FLASH Ha... ha... ha... ha... 
HOPPS Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task-- 
Flash slowly reaches over to the sloth next to him. 
FLASH Hey... Priscilla... 
HOPPS Oh no! 
PRISCILLA Yes... Flash? 
FLASH What... do... 
HOPPS No! 
FLASH You call... a... 
HOPPS A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just- 
FLASH Three... humped... 
HOPPS Aggggggghhhhhhh-- 
INT. DMV - LATER 
A slow DOT-MATRIX printer spits out the address for CAR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER: 29THD03. 
FLASH Here... 
HOPPS Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you! 
FLASH You... go. 
HOPPS (frantically reads) 29THD03-- it's registered to... Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown! 
NICK Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya. 
HOPPS Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and-- 
EXT. DMV - CONTINUOUS 
They go outside. It's night. 
HOPPS IT'S NIGHT?! 
EXT. SNOWY LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
Nick and Hopps reach LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE CAR SERVICE. Hopps tries to open the lock. 
HOPPS Closed. Great. 
NICK Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer. 
There's a big gated parking lot which is chained shut... but they can see a few limos parking inside, covered in snow. 
HOPPS You wasted the day on purpose. 
NICK Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation. 
HOPPS It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see-- (showing picture of Otterton) See him? This otter is missing. 
NICK Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him. 
HOPPS What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life? 
Nick considers this for a moment. 
NICK It does. One hundred percent. (then) Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done? 
Hopps considers this and sighs, defeated. 
HOPPS Fine. We are done. Here's your pen. 
Hopps then casually throws it over the fence behind her. 
NICK Hey! (staring at the pen) (MORE)

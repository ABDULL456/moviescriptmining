INT. CELL. DAY 
HANNA is back in the cell. She puts down a new parcel and a book. She puts the parcel to one side, then opens the book. She then winds back the tape which is already in the recorder. 
MICHAEL'S VOICE The Lady with the Little Dog, a story by Anton Chekhov. The talk was... 
She turns off the tape. She runs her finger along the title `The Lady with the Little Dog'. She gets down a small decorated metal tin, and takes a pencil from it. She starts making the sounds. `The', `the', `the'... L, L, L, etc. 
INT. CELL. NIGHT 
HANNA is working now, circling the word `the' each time it comes in the book. The book is covered in marks. 
EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE 
1981. MICHAEL is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street. He is 37. He goes into his block. He opens the door : the place is much more lived-in. He picks up his mail. Thumbing through it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting. MICHAEL frowns, opening it and taking out a piece of paper. 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE 
MICHAEL is holding a letter. He looks down at the writing : `Thanks for the latest, kid. I really liked it.' He stares, then puts it down and steps back stunned. 
INT. CELL. DAY 
HANNA stands with a new package. She opens it excitedly. She takes out tapes. She looks for writing, a letter. There is none. She turns the packing paper over and over, but there's nothing. She stands, desolate. 
INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE 
HANNA effortfully writing various letters - just a single message on each. The pen working agonizingly across the paper. First : 
I WOULD LIKE MORE ROMANCE, LESS ADVENTURE 
Next: 
I AM NOT SURE WHAT KAFKA IS SAYING 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 
MICHAEL continuing to read to her on the machine. 
INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE 
HANNA still writing. 
DO YOU STILL LIKE DICKENS? 
Then finally, many attempts at the same sentence, written many times : 
DO YOU RECEIVE MY LETTERS? WRITE TO ME, KID 
INT. STUDY. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY 
MICHAEL is reading the latest letter from HANNA. He looks at it. "Do you receive my letters? Write to me, kid." MICHAEL opens a drawer in a file box on the floor. There is a stack of her letters inside. He puts the latest on top of the pile and closes the drawer. 
INT. CELL. PRISON. DAY 
HANNA stands at her window, in despair. 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY 
1988. MICHAEL, 44, is at his desk, with the phone in his hand, with a typed letter in front of him.

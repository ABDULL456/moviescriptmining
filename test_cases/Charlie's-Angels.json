THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY \nA VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off. \nINT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY \nWe move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T- shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and... \n...a very nervous MAN. \nShifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row. We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then we continue moving into -- \nTHE COACH SECTION \nStopping at the lavatory, the \"OCCUPIED\" sign switches to \"VACANT\" and... \nJAMES EARL JONES \n(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones) steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia: multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the works. He heads up the aisle towards -- \nTHE FIRST CLASS CABIN \nWhere he is stopped by a -- \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl... \nMr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET. \nJAMES EARL JONES Is this what you're looking for? \nShe looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes: \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you? \nJAMES EARL JONES Scotch, blended. Straight. \nHe continues into the first class cabin and toward -- \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2. \nTHE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM \nWhere he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window. \nAfter a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans, slightly, towards Jones. \nPASQUAL (tentatively) They say birds can't fly this high. \nJAMES EARL JONES They say only angels can. \nNow Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by -- \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Shall I pour your scotch? \nJAMES EARL JONES No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you. \nShe hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass. She shrugs, leaving... \nPasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- \"Well? What about your end of the bargain?\" \nFrom within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles. \nHe hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism. \nJAMES EARL JONES Ah, c-5. The most dangerous explosive material ever invented. Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks. \nPASQUAL Be careful with it, huh? \nBoth men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done. \nThen suddenly, the lights blink out. \nPasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in- flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a torch. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3. \nCONTINUED: \nColumbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam Sandler in \"BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE.\" \nJames Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes. \nJASON Marix has a thing for red. Red cars, red boats, red-headed hookers. \nALEX So the red one. \nJASON That's why I'm gonna say blue. \nHe makes a \"snip\" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of relief. \nALEX You saved the world again, Logan. \nShe leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                      11. \nCONTINUED: \nJASON That's my job. \nAlex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.          Jason's into it, but pulls away for a second. \nJASON (CONT'D) I don't think Sanchez would kiss me. He's a forty-year-old man. \nPull back to reveal... \nALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream, sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away from home. \nShe licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again. \nALEX Let's have it rewritten. \nAs she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason reach for their phones. It's hers. \nALEX (CONT'D) Hello? \nEXT. JASON'S AIRSTREAM - DAY \nJason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses her stuff in the back of a very excellent car. \nJASON So when you coming back? \nALEX Not sure.   Whenever I can.      I'll call you. \nJASON Oh, great, that's helpful. (watching her prepare to go) I don't get it, what kind of executive assistant is on 24 hour call? \nALEX A very good one. \nJASON You ask me, your boss is an asshole. (beat) When do I get to meet this Charlie guy, anyway? (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  12. \nCONTINUED: \nALEX Charlie's not very social. \nJASON Yeah, well I think you should quit. \nALEX Charlie needs me. \nJASON I need you. \nAlex looks back -- that was more personally revealing than she expected. \nA P.A. comes up next to Jason. \nP.A. Mr. Gibbons?   We're ready for you on the set. \nJason nods, then back to Alex. \nJASON I gotta go save the world. \nAlex smiles at the irony of that. \nALEX My hero. \nShe blows him a kiss and speeds off. \nEXT. BEACH APARTMENT WALKWAY - DAY \nNatalie KNOCKS on the door to 113.      A beat later, the door swings open to reveal BOB. \nNatalie SCREAMS in astonishment. \nBOB (freaked) What!   Natalie, what? \nNATALIE I thought you were dead. \nShe pushes past him. \nINT. BOB'S APARTMENT - DAY \nNatalie makes a beeline for his keys on the table. Starts taking one key off the ring. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     13. \nCONTINUED: NATALIE I thought the police might be here. Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains. \nDYLAN It's good to be him. \nALEX So what's the catch? \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Last night, Knox was kidnapped from his own office. \nON VIDEO: Surveillance camera footage of a parking garage. Two MEN IN HOODS shove Knox into black car. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               16. \nCONTINUED: NATALIE Any ransom? \nCHARLIE'S VOICE No one's heard a thing from the kidnappers. \nA WOMAN'S VOICE They don't want money. They just want to sink our company. \nA striking WOMAN IN A SUIT stands in the doorway. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice president of finance for Knox Technologies. She's hired us to find Knox. \nVIVIAN WU (entering) The initial public offering is in three days. If we don't get Mr. Knox back, or if word gets out that he's missing, the company stands to lose a billion dollars. \nShe seems to direct this next sentence right to Natalie. \nVIVIAN WU (CONT'D) We need your help. \nALEX Charlie, where do we start? \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Alex, I want you and Bosley to stake out Roger Corwin. \nBosley is excited to hear his name mentioned. \nON VIDEO: Roger Corwin. He's an unpleasant-looking man, who's even nastier when he tries to smile. We see logos for his company, Red Star Systems \nCHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) For the past year, he's been trying to buy Knox's company and their new browser software. Knox refused to sell. His company, Red Start Systems, has the most to gain from Knox's disappearance. \nALEX Kidnap the founder and you sink the company. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   17. \nCONTINUED: \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is still alive, Corwin might lead us to him. \nDYLAN We're on it. \nNATALIE Any chance you can join us, Charlie? \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE'S POV \nWe see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold. We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan -- the ground is hundreds of feet below. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) I'd love to, angels, but I've got my hands full this morning. \nTwo beautiful and buxomly CLIMBING BUDDIES smile at him. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. PALM SPRINGS SPA - DAY \nEstablishing... \nEXT. SPA DECK / OUTSIDE WALKWAY - DAY \nBuilt into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive spa has a fantastic view of the desert. \nDressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic device shaped like a bullet. \nALEX This is a transmitter. I'll be able to hear everything you say. \nBOSLEY Where do I hide it? (leaning close) I'll be nude. \nAlex takes a plastic cup, drops the transmitter into it. Covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket. \nBosley nods, clever. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  18. \nCONTINUED: ALEX Try to get Corwin to talk about the industry, Knox, anything. \nBOSLEY Understood. \nShe points him in the direction of the men's spa.    But he's frozen with excitement. \nBOSLEY (CONT'D) I'm going undercover. \nALEX I know.   You'll do great. \nINT. MEN'S STEAM ROOM - DAY \nA burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his chest. \nAs more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest. Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't know. \nThe seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat. \nA beat. Yeah, he must have.     A patented ANGELS FLIP leads us to... \nCUT TO: \nINT. NATALIE'S EXCELLENT CONVERTIBLE - DAY \nThe Angels are all in the car together, cruising down Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat, Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap. \nNATALIE Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type. \nDYLAN (to Alex, under her breath) I drive too fast. Look who's talking. \nShe pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Three double doubles, animal style. Fries. Three chocolate shakes. \nWhile they wait for their order, Natalie punches something up on her computer. \nNATALIE Here's Corwin's itinerary. \nONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the next week. Two events in particular stand out: \nTUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL \nTHURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY \nDylan glances over the schedule. \nDYLAN Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight. I only wish we had a clue to go on. \nThe food comes, Dylan takes it. \nNATALIE Hold that thought. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                    22. \nCONTINUED: \nNatalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the keyboard. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment. \nDYLAN Sorry. \nNatalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at the keyboard. \nNATALIE Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping... \nOn screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask is partly pulled away from his face. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) ... isolate the part of the suspect's face that's revealed, then retriangulate his bone structure... \nThe program zooms in on the revealed part of his face, then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts to appear. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) ... and voila!     We've got a composite. \nNatalie's portable printer spits out a simulated composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs it, looks it over. \nDYLAN Sweet. Now we've got someone to look for. \nShe hands it to Alex to inspect. \nALEX Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot with that open head wound. \nShe turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has smudged his head with ketchup. \nThey all just have to laugh. \nWIPE TO: \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  23. \nINT. BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAY \nA sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of smart suits and power ties. \nDressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively- dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES. \nDYLAN The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities, \"This one is up 50 points, this one is down 10.\" It's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector. \nA few nods.    She makes a good point. \nBROKER GUY Which analysis method do you prefer? \nOn Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall... \nDYLAN Well, there are so many options. I mean, who can say what the one best choice is? \nACROSS THE ROOM \nStill walking, Natalie talks to no one... \nNATALIE Keppler-Wilson. \nBACK WITH DYLAN \nDYLAN Pardon me. \nHe doesn't respond, but something about this man raises her suspicions. Where has she seen him before? As he moves out of earshot... \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Natalie.   Nine o'clock. Thin man. \nON NATALIE \nNATALIE I'm on it. \nSpotting the Thin Man, she heads his way. \nNATALIE (offering) Vegetarian spring roll? \nHe waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front of him. She kneels down to get it. \nAs we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into the rim. \nIt BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) (to earpiece) Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder. \nDYLAN You call it. \nNATALIE You take point. I'll circle behind. \nDYLAN Copy. \nINT. HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Thin Man is headed down the hall.    Looking back, we see Dylan enter from the ballroom. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 27. \nCONTINUED: DYLAN Excuse me? \nHe doesn't turn back. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Excuse me, do you know which way the ladies' room is? \nThe man takes a sudden right into a service hallway. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Why do they always run? \nShe slips off her heels to give chase. \nINT. SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe Thin Man comes around the corner.       We stay TIGHT on him, until he suddenly stops. \nNATALIE \nhas come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in. \nAnd then, a DING! \nElevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue- less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones. In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place. Hits the button. \nFrom opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the panel. \nDYLAN He's going down. \nThey take the stairs. \nINT. BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY \nNatalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY \nNat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking down the alley. \nNATALIE That way. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 28. \nCONTINUED: \nAnd they take off after him. \nWhat ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights: \n-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick and run up the side wall and hop over easily. \n-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow, then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again. Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and rolling under the wheels of a moving semi. \n-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts. \n-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat. The scene goes something like this: \nINT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM \nThunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when \nTHREE SHOTS \nring out.    They dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly. \nALEX That looks like our target. \nShe points to a door at the back of the bar that leads into a glassed-in office. Two, beefy bouncer types are guarding the door. \nALEX (CONT'D) I'm gonna need a distraction. \nDylan and Natalie smile at each other. \nDYLAN I think that can be arranged. \nThe Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan. \nDYLAN \nsidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are downing shots, one after another. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Three shots of tequila, please. (Bosley whispers in her ear) And one Tom Collins. \nThe rednecks stare at Dylan, drooling.       Dylan turns to the first one. \nREDNECK Hey baby, why don't you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap? \nBosley tries to make himself small. \nDYLAN Ooh, that is an enticing offer. But I got a better idea. How about a shot contest? My treat? \nThe three rednecks hoot and holler. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Bartender? Bring ten shots of tequila over to my table. And keep em coming. \nBY THE MECHANICAL BULL (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  32. \nCONTINUED: \nA group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the mechanical bull. Natalie wanders over behind them. \nNATALIE Mind if I try? \nThe crowd parts for her, and Natalie hops up on the bull. She cranks it up, and lets \nBY THE BAR -- \nDylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.      Countless other glasses surround her. \nREVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table. \nThe third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up with Dylan. DYLAN Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's have a chair throwing contest. \nREDNECK Hunh? \nDYLAN Chair throwing? Never heard of it? You just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can. \nThe redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across the bar. \nOKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF THIS SCENE: \nDylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number of the chalet. \nEXT. HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nA VW van climbs the winding road.       As we get closer, we see the side reads, \"Chalet Grams.\" \nA DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings. \nINT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE / GREAT ROOM - NIGHT \nTWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell. One was tending to the fire. \nTHUG ONE We expecting somebody? (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              33. \nCONTINUED: \nThug Two shakes his head. \nChecking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker. Puts it on over. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nThug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids. \nDYLAN Guten Tag! \nNATALIE (correcting Dylan) Guten Morgen! \nDYLAN (correcting Natalie) Guten Nacht! \nDYLAN AND NATALIE (to each other) Guten Freund! \nThe girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out. To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen, with a feather in his hat. \nNatalie begins to YODEL. \nDylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is going on. \nThe thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of them pulling out a firearm. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nHolding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio. \nBOSLEY Alex, what's your status? \nINT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nRunning, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their backs. She talks into a wrist-mic. \nALEX Good news:   I found Knox. \nAnother THUG steps out in front of her.      She kicks him down the steps. \nALEX (CONT'D) Bad news:    I found company. \nReaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be grabbed by Dylan. \nDYLAN This way. \nAt this point, he'll do whatever they say. \nEXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT \nDylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van -- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright security lights switch on. \nBack at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord from it around the porch column. \nINT. FOYER - NIGHT \nThe first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it open but can't. The next few guards try to help him, while the rest start smashing through the windows. \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               37. \nEXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT \nRunning with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run again. \nHe's the last to be pulled into the van.    A spray of gravel and they're off. \nINT. THE VAN - NIGHT \nEveryone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES. \nAt the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total control. \nLooking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the house, more thugs appear on motorbikes. \nALEX They're coming after us. \nDYLAN (to Knox, confident) We were expecting that. \nNATALIE Okay, new problem. \nEveryone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of \nGIANT LOGGING TRUCK \ncoming up the high mountain road. It straddles the center line, blocking both directions. There's no way around it. NATALIE (CONT'D) Thoughts, suggestions, points to consider? \nBOSLEY I don't suppose giving up would be a... \nNo, it wouldn't.   Then -- \nDYLAN Right! \nNATALIE There is no right. \nDYLAN There! (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   38. \nCONTINUED: \nShe points to a faded \"CLOSED\" sign that hangs from a chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking. But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming truck, we know there's no choice. \nNatalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign. \nThe van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass, its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any moment, the ground could stop in a cliff. \nLike now. \nThe van leaps into empty space.      Tires spin, helpless. The van falls. \nEveryone SCREAMS.    Bosley is the loudest. \nAnd then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the wheel hard to avoid hitting \nA CONCRETE WALL \nin front of them.    Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge they're alive. \nDYLAN Where are we? \nSuddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead. \nDYLAN Call him, he'll totally understand. \nNATALIE \"Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a billionaire.\" (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  41. \nCONTINUED: \nALEX Hard left! \nShe makes the left. \nNATALIE I'll sound like a flake.   I can't stand flakes. \nDYLAN He will so give you the second chance. \nNATALIE You think? \nDYLAN Hello, I saw the way he looked at you. \nOne motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield, then goes flying. \nALEX We're at the bottom! \nIndeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground. Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around. Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with Charlie. \nEXT. BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT \nBack facing the right direction, the van charges onward. The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing for the door. \nINT. THE VAN - NIGHT \nDylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off. \nThe sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth rider in the process. \nDYLAN (genuinely impressed) Well done. \nKNOX Thanks. \nCUT TO: \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                42. \nHELICOPTER \nthunders over.    We are... \nINT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT \nNatalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.      Alex leans forward from the second row. \nBOSLEY I think that went very well. Charlie should send me on more missions. \nALEX We couldn't have done it without you, Bos. \nNatalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick glance. They have to just laugh. \nIn the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights of Aspen. \nDYLAN Cocktail? \nShe offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks in a single shot. A smile, and then... \nMUSIC rises. \nTHE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends. \nThe act is over.    After a beat, we \nWIPE TO REVEAL: \nEXT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY \nRe-establishing. \nINT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - (THE NEXT) DAY \nCharlie is on the speakerphone.      The angels are in their usual lounging positions. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well. \nDYLAN I think that earns us a vacation. \nNATALIE Say, Fiji? \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 43. \nCONTINUED: \nALEX (to Natalie) Any special guy you were thinking of inviting? \nNatalie grins a guilty smile. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only half-done. \nEXT. SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY \nTo a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves through the spectator traffic entering the speedway. \nLooking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him. \nFinally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip. \nCUT TO: \nHELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE \nLooking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police pursuit is in progress. \nTV ANCHOR VOICE If you're just joining us, we're approaching hour five of a pursuit that has lead us all across the Southland, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour. \nA beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing. \nFEMALE ANCHOR VOICE Chuck, time and again we hear the question, \"Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires?\" The LAPD has a policy of hanging back and following unless... \nSuddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour. \nTV ANCHOR VOICE What was that? \nINT. NATALIE'S RED CAR / ON THE FREEWAY - DAY \nStill hot on the Thin Man's tail, Natalie has the engine ROARING. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               52. \nCONTINUED: \nAs she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS look over -- what the hell? \nNatalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel. \nHe looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him, just taillights on the freeway. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nWith the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top speed -- which they do. \nNatalie is catching up to the Thin Man. \nAs they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING. \nINT. BLUE CAR - DAY \nThe Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often. \nUp ahead, he sees an exit.   He starts to slow down... \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \n... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can take a while. He misses the exit. \nNatalie is trying to match his speed. \nThe Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully. Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him. \nThe Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp. \nNatalie follows. \nEXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY \nWe catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars -- the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like lions pacing. \nINT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY \nPulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier. \nEXT. SHIPYARD - DAY \nWe LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner, still searching. \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               53. \nEXT. PIER - DAY \nNatalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops, engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's past Natalie. \nThe Thin Man REVS his engine. \nNatalie REVS hers. \nANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up, hearing the engines. \nANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter. REVS his engine higher. \nANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants, she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still. \nThe noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers to peel out. \nA cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt. \nAlready reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away. Neither is Natalie. \nANGLE ON Roger Corwin, driving his Mercedes.     He slows, a road crew working ahead. \nANGLE ON Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the slow/stop sign. She makes Corwin stop, leans in to apologize for the delay. \nBehind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up. She quickly picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. She hoists in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside. \nINT. TRUNK OF CORWIN'S MERCEDES - DAY \nWe HEAR the car moving again. \nStripped down to a bra, Natalie attaches an illuminated mirror to the underside of the trunk lid. Starts to pull more items from her duffel bag: black shoes, a dress shirt, a tie. \nEXT. RED STAR - DAY \nEstablishing. We see Corwin's Mercedes pull into the parking garage. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE / RED STAR - DAY \nWalking away from the car, Corwin hits the remote.    The Mercedes BWOOPS. \nA beat later, a hand comes out from under the trunk lid. Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore. \nShe's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail. \nShe tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as she walks. FREEZE FRAME. \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 57. \nINT. SECURITY STATION - DAY \nCorwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid.    A laser scans it. Approved. \nThe Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate. He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through. A beat, then... \nA VOICE Tommy? You gonna let me through or what? \nTommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the counter. \nTOMMY THE GUARD (confused) Oh.     Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin. \nHe hits the button again, letting Corwin through. Tommy goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed. \nINT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY \nThe same places we saw on the videotape. Natalie-as- Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader, sending the lights from red to green. FREEZE FRAME. \nShe splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack. Pulls up a tiny antenna. FREEZE FRAME. \nINT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY \nCorwin walks down the hall, still talking with his colleague. Natalie-as-Corwin is walking right towards them. She turns away as she passes. He didn't even spot her. \nShe smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY \nEstablishing... \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nAs a group, the angels move through the upscale lunch crowd to find Knox and Vivian Wu at a booth. \nAlex opens a slim Sony laptop, sets it on the table. \nALEX It's done. Red Star's mainframe is open for business. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  58. \nCONTINUED: \nAstonished, Vivian Wu hits some keys, checking that what they say is true. \nDYLAN (to a passing waiter) Champagne, please. Your best. \nSmiling, Knox motions for them to take a seat. \nKNOX Now I know why I hired you.   You're the best. \nA look between the angels.      They know it's true. \nVIVIAN WU (to Knox, re: laptop) I'll have Systems get to work on this right away. \nShe reaches for the laptop.      Bosley snatches it away. \nBOSLEY Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to work on this right away. Any evidence we find will be turned over to you AND the proper authorities. \nVIVIAN WU I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr... \nBOSLEY Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll take very good care of it when I find it. \nVIVIAN WU (reaching for the laptop) But... \nKNOX Vivian, please. Do as the man says. \nReluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away. Bosley tucks the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands. \nVIVIAN WU (ignoring him) The Angels will figure out they were duped. We can't afford them jeopardizing our plans. \nTHE THIN MAN Here it comes... \nVIVIAN WU (coldly) We have to Kill Charlie's Angels. \nThe Thin Man sighs, whips out his cell phone. \nTHE THIN MAN Guess I'll cancel my weekend plans. \nAnd speaking of weekend plans... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ITALIAN STREET - NIGHT \nJason and Alex are walking down a beautiful, tree-lined cobblestone street, holding hands. The buildings and outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely European town. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   62. \nCONTINUED: JASON Alex, I can't tell you how happy I am you came. \nALEX Me too. \nJASON No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something? \nALEX (smiling) Got me. \nJASON The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me? \nALEX We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine. \nHe stops, takes her in his arms. With the moonlight shining down, it's very romantic. They kiss. Then... \nJASON Hey.   Wait a second.   Come with me! \nALEX Come with you? \nJASON Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four. \nALEX Jason, I don't... \nJASON Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there. \nALEX It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and... \nJASON What if I changed all that? (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  63. \nCONTINUED: JASON (CONT'D) What if I told you to quit your job, and come live with me. What I'm saying, Alex, is that I want you to... \nBLAM!    BLAM!   Gunshots ring out! \nALEX Gunfire!   Get down! \nAlex, in Angels mode, immediately throws him to the ground and covers him. She feels something wet, looks down to see Jason's chest, covered in blood. \nALEX (CONT'D) My God, you're hit. You're... \nJASON Fine.  I'm fine. (he laughs) They're squibs, it's fake.   See? \nHe wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue.     Finally convinced, she almost lets herself laugh. \nREVEAL \nthat we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the open loading door. \nJASON (CONT'D) Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene. \nHe helps her up. \nALEX Sorry about that, I... \nJASON (smiling) God, I loved that. The way you yelled and everything? Baby, you been watching too many movies. (he kisses her on the nose) Alright, I gotta go reset these. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to finish this conversation. \nAs he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind, alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her own paranoia. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               64. \nCONTINUED: \nALEX Nice, Alex.   Real nice. \nTHIPP! \nA wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.     Alex looks at the hole. That's strange. \nTHIP, THIP! \nTwo more little explosions, these barely missing her face. \nALEX (CONT'D) Hey, is someone firing more squibs or... \nSuddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese. \nA DOOR LATCH \nCLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN.          He's at least 6'3\". \nHe stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun.      A beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing... \nAN EMPTY STALL. \nThe automatic toilet FLUSHES itself.      The Man takes a half-step in, confused. Suddenly -- (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                67. \nCONTINUED: \nThe door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.     He drops the gun, looking up to see \nNATALIE, \nWho is perched atop the stall walls.     She pushed the door with her foot. \nGrabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls into the next row of stalls. \nNatalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles. He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over. That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts. \nWith a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe. \nNATALIE Who do you work for? \nHe tries to pull her off.    She leans in harder. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Speak now or never again. \nTHE MAN (motioning with eyes) Jacket pocket. \nSuspicious, she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather billfold. Flips it open to reveal an I.D. that reads... \nNATALIE National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA? \nTHE MAN I've been following you. I didn't know which side you were on. (beat) This is bigger than you think. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nThe anime classic is playing. Pete keeps looking back towards the door. He's been ditched again. Just when he's about to give up hope, Natalie is there. \nNATALIE I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. (hands card) This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     68. \nCONTINUED: \nWith that, she goes. A beat, then she comes back. Kisses him once, hard. Then goes for real. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT \nDylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from the hill in front of them. \nDYLAN Where's that music coming from? \nKNOX You'll see.    Just a little farther. \nHe helps her up a steep part of the path.       As she comes over the crest of a hill. \nDYLAN Oh... (taking in the view) Oh wow. \nDYLAN'S POV -- \nThe hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony playing something very romantic. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) That's amazing. \nThey stand there, together, just listening to the music, Knox watching her reaction closely. \nKNOX Can I ask you a personal question? \nDYLAN Maybe. \nKNOX How much do you know about Charlie? \nDylan seems surprised by this question. \nKNOX (CONT'D) I just find it strange that you work for a man you've never met. \nDYLAN Well, I don't know what he looks like, but I feel like I know him. We all do. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  69. \nCONTINUED: KNOX And none of you have any clue who he actually is? \nDYLAN Nope. \nKNOX And you're never curious to find out? \nDYLAN Of course, but believe me, it's impossible. I've tried. (beat) Let's not talk about Charlie, okay? Or work. \nShe smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to Knox's house. \nCLOSE ON Dylan.      What does that mean? \nVivian snaps her phone shut. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 72. \nCONTINUED: \nVIVIAN WU (CONT'D) (to Knox) Bad news: The other angels are still alive. Good news: Everything else proceeding apace. \nDylan stands up.    What the hell is going on? \nVivian draws the gun on her.    Knox moves over toward Vivian's side. \nKNOX Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment would come sooner or later. I was just hoping for later. \nA long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this. \nDYLAN All this time, we thought Red Star was behind this, but it was you. (realizing) You faked your kidnapping. \nKnox taps his nose.    She's got it. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Why? \nKNOX To gain your trust. And get your help. (beat) I want you to know, my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication. \nDYLAN Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker. \nDylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) I can't believe I trusted you. \nKNOX Why not? You trust Charlie and you've never even met him. \nDylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   73. \nCONTINUED: KNOX (CONT'D) And believe me, there's a lot about him that you don't know. Anyway, I'm not going to be an idiot and stand here talking when we could do something useful, like KILL YOU. Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you... \nHow right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the trigger... \nDylan drops to the floor, then rolls. \nBLAM! \nthe bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian pumps off shots. \nAs she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted. \nSMASH! \nThe bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out the window, onto the ledge. \nKNOX (CONT'D) Wow. (to Vivian) I've never seen YOU do something like that. \nVIVIAN WU Oh, shut up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BALCONY - NIGHT \nDylan looks over the edge of the balcony. The drop-off is incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the fall looks like it would kill her. But she doesn't have much choice. \nKNOX AND VIVIAN \ncome running out onto the balcony, just in time to see Dylan jump. They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding thicket of trees. \nVIVIAN WU She can't have survived.   It's too far. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                74. \nCONTINUED: \nVIVIAN WU (CONT'D) (beat) Still, I should probably check... \nKnox shakes his head. \nKNOX We've got more important things to do. \nThe two of them head back inside.    As they do... \nWe hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to the underside of the balcony. Dylan has attached her belt to the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters. As she pulls herself back up... WIPE TO: \nEXT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT \nA black sedan pulls onto the tarmac. Knox and Vivian Wu emerge, then hustle into a waiting private plane. \nINT. ANGELS DETECTIVE AGENCY \nNatalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes. \nDYLAN I can't believe Knox tried to kill me. I mean, I've been lied to, I've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to SHOOT me before. (coldly) I'm gonna get him for that. \nEXT. RUINS OF TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY \nThe angels still can't believe they're hearing his voice. \nDYLAN Can we trace him? \nNATALIE Not off a boosted signal. We'd have to be within 20 miles. \nALEX Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are. \nINT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY \nBOSLEY I don't know where I am, really. I'm in a round room. The walls are white. Well. Not white-white. More of a cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes, I'm going to say vanilla. \nINTERCUT \nThis isn't helping. \nBOSLEY (CONT'D) I can see the ocean. \nALEX Bingo. \nDylan finds a globe amid the wreckage.

Maybe more. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  78. \nCONTINUED: \nWith her fingers, Dylan figures out how far he could have flown. Estimates the circumference. \nDYLAN (frustrated) He could be anywhere in North America. \nThe bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song. \nBOSLEY Wherever it is, they have really good pudding. \nNatalie holds up a finger -- stop. \nDYLAN (incredulous) What, pudding? \nThe bird SINGS its song again.      Natalie smiles. \nNATALIE Hear that? That's a blue spotted egret. They only live in one place. \nALEX Florida. \nThe MUSIC revs up, as we... CUT TO: \nEXT.

No time like the present. \nThe Thin Man nods. \nINT. KNOX COMPOUND - DAY \nThe Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs. \nThen, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her arms to the arms of the chair. As they do: \nDYLAN I don't know why you bother.   I've already won. \nTHIN MAN Is that so? \nDYLAN Every moment I sit here is a moment I'm using to figure out how to take you down. In fact, this statement -- this one I'm making right here-- is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I'm going to flatten first. (whispering) It's gonna be the guy behind me. \nThe Thin Man can't help but be amused.

Cliche as that sounds. (then to the last two) Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun. \nThe Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently. \nTHE THIN MAN And what will you do to me? \nDYLAN You won't even be here. I mean, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal -- \nSuddenly the door flies open and -- \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Ah!

Got it? \nKnox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him.      Then he gets in the elevator. \nThe Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets closer and closer... \nJASON (O.S.) Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on? \nThe Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her. \nALEX Jason, hi, I... \nThe Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back. \nALEX (CONT'D) Can I talk to you later? \nJASON No you can talk to me NOW. I want to know what the hell is going on. First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye. \nALEX I'm sorry, I... \nJASON Now, I see you here, but you're with some other guy. \nTHIN MAN Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost. \nJason double takes.

I'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do. \nAnd then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the Thin Man. \nNow, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain. \nThe Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles. \nAlex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange. \nALEX You're kidding me. \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                98. \nNATALIE \nis fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full- out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other cheerleaders. She's better. \nON THE COURT \nThe SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another agenda as well... \nCOURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER The time out is over, but one cheerleader doesn't seem to notice. Officials can't start the clock again while she's on the court. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS \nDylan has picked two wires. \nDYLAN Chartreuse and magenta.   This has gotta be it. \nShe prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when... \nKNOX (O.S.) I wouldn't do that, if I were you. \nShe spins to see Knox, standing behind her. \nKNOX (CONT'D) See, if you snip ANY of those wires, the bomb WILL blow up. \nDYLAN It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero. \nKNOX Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential? \nHe holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene. \nKNOX (CONT'D) THIS is what triggers that bomb.

We have a lot in common. \nDYLAN Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one. \nKnox laughs. \nKNOX Good one. (beat, as he backs up) Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same. \nKnox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way. \nALEX Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded. \nNATALIE Give us the detonator. \nKNOX NO! \nStumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high. \nKNOX (CONT'D) I'll blow this building sky high, I swear! \nCHARLIE (O.S.) Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want, not all these innocent people. \nEveryone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows. \nKNOX Charlie? \nThat's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing. \nHe's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a \"We're #1\" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance. \nANGELS Charlie? \nCharlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.

Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail. (beat) He was my friend. \nKNOX It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father! \nCHARLIE Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric. \nCharlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target. \nIt's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching Knox decide Charlie's fate. \nKnox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined. He starts lowering his gun. \nKNOX Okay.  You're right. (quickly) I'll just kill you. \n", "test1_input": "And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of Johnnie Walker Black.

He speaks over the ever-growing pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki... \nBOSLEY Nothing a little teamwork can't do. At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies? \nDYLAN Charlie will be joining us, won't he? \nBOSLEY He sends his regrets. But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate. \nBy now, the Angels have stripped off all of their equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns. \nALEX If it's on Charlie, we will. \nThe Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them with a tray of champagne flutes. \nThey each take a glass, turn to each other and raise them.

These are three very different girls. \nNATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit awkward and gangly, even shy. \nALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten. \nDYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded, street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) ... there were three very different little girls. \nThe triptych remains on screen.    Now it shifts into: \nVIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH) \nNow TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO. \nNATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera. FREEZE. \nALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy. She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE. \nDYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls' room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She flips it off. FREEZE. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Who grew up into three very different women. \nTRIPTYCH CONTINUES \nThey're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties. \nNATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors. \nALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents. \nDYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend. She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) With three things in common... \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              8. \nTRIPTYCH ENDS \nWith photographs again.

ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon. \n-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish, attacking the last jump with gusto. \n-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs. \n-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple. \n-- Bosley, as \"Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp,\" bitch-slaps a couple of \"ho's\" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared. \n--   Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh. \n-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller- derby match. \n-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in female chain-gang. \n-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office, surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              9. \nCONTINUED: \n-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper, grin at the headline, \"Mystery Women Save European Union.\" As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each other...and just have to laugh. \nTITLE SEQUENCE ENDS. \nOVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING... \nINT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling into her head? \nChecking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the pocket to find her cell phone. Answering... \nDYLAN Hi. (recognizing voice) Hi.   Okay. I'll be right in. \nShe clicks the phone off, then starts looking around. Where the fuck is she? \nFrom the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing \"My Sharona.\" She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on. Closing her eyes, she prays... \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Not him.

If you... \nKNOX (quickly) I'm scared. \nDylan is surprised by this. \nKNOX (CONT'D) Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't fun. I know, you probably have other plans, but it would be very reassuring. \nDylan looks him over. Normally, she'd be suspicious, but the guy WAS just kidnapped, and he seems sincere. \nKNOX (CONT'D) Come on, don't make me beg. I'm embarrassed already. \nShe smiles. \nDYLAN Don't be. \nShe throws her coat back on the sofa. \nINT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe PAN OFF a half-played Scrabble game to find Dylan and Knox at the windows.

(looking at the photo) I never knew how they died. When I was a kid, when I got shuffled from one foster home to another, I always thought they just disappeared. \nDYLAN But...? \nKNOX I only found out later, my father was in the military. He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in Eastern Europe. (mostly to himself) The files were classified, but I read enough to know that he was a good man. Apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team. \nDYLAN Wow.   That's a lot for a kid to live with. \nKNOX Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my family. It still does. I don't take anything for granted. \nDylan nods. \nDYLAN Boy did I have you pegged wrong. \nKNOX (intrigued) How do you mean? \nDYLAN Well, to be honest, I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. But that's pretty typical. I've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? Well... \nKNOX I'm glad you don't see me as just a client. \nHe brushes his hand against hers.

It was a damn good kiss.

You do that. \nCorwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing the Thin Man in the process. \nAS CORWIN PULLS OUT \nDylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both ways to see if she's being watched. \nBOSLEY (O.S.)

She carefully switches all his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then gives Alex a thumbs up. \nMEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE -- \nNATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her sights.

This is where you shoot each other. \nThe two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall. \nJust Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still taped to her forearms. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Okay, here's where we improvise. \nIn a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5.

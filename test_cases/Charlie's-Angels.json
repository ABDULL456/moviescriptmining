BEACH DOCK - DAY \nNow, MEN IN \"FBI\" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock. \nIt's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.

He speaks over the ever-growing pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki... \nBOSLEY Nothing a little teamwork can't do. At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies? \nDYLAN Charlie will be joining us, won't he? \nBOSLEY He sends his regrets. But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate. \nBy now, the Angels have stripped off all of their equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns. \nALEX If it's on Charlie, we will. \nThe Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them with a tray of champagne flutes. \nThey each take a glass, turn to each other and raise them.

These are three very different girls. \nNATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit awkward and gangly, even shy. \nALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten. \nDYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded, street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) ... there were three very different little girls. \nThe triptych remains on screen.    Now it shifts into: \nVIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH) \nNow TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO. \nNATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera. FREEZE. \nALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy. She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE. \nDYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls' room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She flips it off. FREEZE. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Who grew up into three very different women. \nTRIPTYCH CONTINUES \nThey're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties. \nNATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors. \nALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents. \nDYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend. She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) With three things in common... \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              8. \nTRIPTYCH ENDS \nWith photographs again. The women, as they are now: Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) They're brilliant. They're beautiful. And they work for me. \nNow, FIREBALL EXPLOSIONS completely fill the screen. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) My name is Charlie. \n", "test1_true": "\"CHARLIE'S ANGELS\" \n...And a new title sequence takes over: \nVARIOUS SHOTS:   MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC) \nCredits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from, presumably, previous adventures...) \n-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in a laser housing, shoots a red beam. \n--   Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza. \n-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third. ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon. \n-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish, attacking the last jump with gusto. \n-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs. \n-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple. \n-- Bosley, as \"Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp,\" bitch-slaps a couple of \"ho's\" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared. \n--   Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh. \n-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller- derby match. \n-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in female chain-gang. \n-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office, surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              9. \nCONTINUED: \n-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper, grin at the headline, \"Mystery Women Save European Union.\" As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each other...and just have to laugh. \nTITLE SEQUENCE ENDS. \nOVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING... \nINT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling into her head? \nChecking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the pocket to find her cell phone. Answering... \nDYLAN Hi. (recognizing voice) Hi.   Okay. I'll be right in. \nShe clicks the phone off, then starts looking around. Where the fuck is she? \nFrom the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing \"My Sharona.\" She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on. Closing her eyes, she prays... \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Not him.   Not him, not him, not him. \nTHE VOICE 'Morning starfish. \nDYLAN Oh God no. \nAt the door, skinny shirtless CHAD holds a skillet of eggs. \nCHAD Hungry? \nEXT.

A horrible, horrible mistake. \nShe jumps onto the dock. \nCHAD Then how come we keep getting back together? It's fate. \nDylan just keeps walking. \nCHAD (yelling after) Is it because I live on a boat? \nWHIP TO: \nCLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE \nThis is Jason Gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.       He's concentrating fiercely. \nALEX (O.S.) If you don't defuse this bomb, Logan, L.A.'s going to be a new underwater attraction. \nA bead of sweat drops down Jason's face. \nJASON Get off my back, Sanchez.

SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY \nTo a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves through the spectator traffic entering the speedway. \nLooking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him. \nFinally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip. \nCUT TO: \nHELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE \nLooking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police pursuit is in progress. \nTV ANCHOR VOICE If you're just joining us, we're approaching hour five of a pursuit that has lead us all across the Southland, at speeds up to 80 miles an hour. \nA beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing. \nFEMALE ANCHOR VOICE Chuck, time and again we hear the question, \"Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires?\" The LAPD has a policy of hanging back and following unless... \nSuddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour. \nTV ANCHOR VOICE What was that? \nINT. NATALIE'S RED CAR / ON THE FREEWAY - DAY \nStill hot on the Thin Man's tail, Natalie has the engine ROARING. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               52. \nCONTINUED: \nAs she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS look over -- what the hell? \nNatalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel. \nHe looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him, just taillights on the freeway. \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \nWith the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top speed -- which they do. \nNatalie is catching up to the Thin Man. \nAs they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING. \nINT. BLUE CAR - DAY \nThe Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often. \nUp ahead, he sees an exit.   He starts to slow down... \nEXT. FREEWAY - DAY \n... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can take a while. He misses the exit. \nNatalie is trying to match his speed. \nThe Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully. Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him. \nThe Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp. \nNatalie follows. \nEXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY \nWe catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars -- the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like lions pacing. \nINT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY \nPulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier. \nEXT. SHIPYARD - DAY \nWe LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner, still searching. \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               53. \nEXT. PIER - DAY \nNatalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops, engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's past Natalie. \nThe Thin Man REVS his engine. \nNatalie REVS hers. \nANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up, hearing the engines. \nANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter. REVS his engine higher. \nANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants, she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still. \nThe noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers to peel out. \nA cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt. \nAlready reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away. Neither is Natalie. \n", "test2_true": "In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air, wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the water first. \nNatalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear tire just 1/4 inch from the edge. \nCRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie looking into the water where the blue racer went in. There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles. \nCUT TO: \nVIDEO / CAMERA'S P.O.V. \nWe see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all from the POV of a man's hip. \nThe footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase that Corwin is now carrying with him. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               54. \nCONTINUED: \nWe PULL BACK from the video to see we are actually watching it... \nINT. CHARLES TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY \n... on the big screen. The angels and Bosley watch the footage, along with Knox and Vivian Wu. Vivian has seated herself close to Natalie. So close, in fact, that Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches. \nDylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from Knox, deliberately avoiding eye contact. \nON THE BIG SCREEN: As the videocamera passes a room marked with an intimidating warning sign... \nKNOX There! \nVIDEO FREEZES. \nKNOX (CONT'D) That's the room with the mainframe. Everything at Red Star goes through that system. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox's technology, that's the computer to tap. \nKNOX Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls and encryption. You can't jack in from outside. You'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data. \nALEX Even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it. There's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there. It could take days. \nNATALIE So you install a transmitter. \nAll eyes go over to Natalie. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) Patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency. That way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home. And they have no idea that you can peek inside. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               55. \nCONTINUED: \nKnox is impressed.    The other angels nod.   It's a good idea. \nVIVIAN WU That's all fine in theory. But you still have to get inside that room to install it. What about security? \nALEX Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight. Key- card badges throughout. Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping. \nVIVIAN WU It sounds impossible. \nAlex checks with her fellow angels.    They're in agreement. \nDYLAN It sounds like fun. \nWith a subtle RUSH, we move into a stylized MONTAGE that shows How They Do It. It features WHIP PANS, FREEZE FRAMES and ZOOMS to show us only the highlights. \nNATALIE (V.O.) Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe. We have to get their keys. \nWHIP CUT TO: \nINT. NUDE NUDE NUDE GIRLS - DAY \nANGLE ON DIRECTOR #1, 40's, part of the lunchtime crowd. Alex and Natalie are on the catwalk, in the middle of a grinding routine. Paying for his drink, he fumbles with his wallet. His waitress helps him find the right bill. \nAs she walks away, we see the waitress is Dylan. FREEZE FRAME. We ZOOM IN on the orange key-card she's grabbed from him. \nEXT. BACK YARD BIRTHDAY PART - DAY \nANGLE ON Bosley, done up in full clown makeup. He tries to twist a balloon animal, but no luck. Finally it POPS. The CHILDREN CRY. \nEntertaining the ADULTS, magician Alex whips open her silk handkerchief to reveal that the \"item\" has disappeared. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  56. \nCONTINUED: \nANGLE ON DIRECTOR #2, who looks very worried. Magician's assistant Dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the director's billfold is underneath. Getting it back, he's relieved. \nPassing behind Dylan, Natalie takes the orange keycard Dylan hands off. FREEZE FRAME. ZOOM IN. \nALEX (V.O.) Then we have to get back into Red Star. Problem is, their biometric sensors are too good. \nDYLAN (V.O.) We need someone's help. \nWHIP TO: \nEXT. STREET OFF MULHOLLAND - DAY \n", "test2_id": 436, "test3_input": "NATALIE I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy.

She throws the limp body on the floor. \nA beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley. \nNATALIE (CONT'D) (suddenly chipper) Hi, Bos! \nHe waves. \nEXT. VERANDAH - DAY \nFrom below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her. \nDYLAN Here we go. \nAnd now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do: \nShe pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Okay, that part worked. \nThe Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on the head of -- \nFat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin. \nQuickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Now, guys, I warned you. This is where you shoot each other. \nThe two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall. \nJust Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still taped to her forearms. \nDYLAN (CONT'D) Okay, here's where we improvise. \nIn a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm into the back of the Guard #6's head. (CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   89. \nCONTINUED: \nA few more blows, then both men fall. \nNow Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted, half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it all in, then -- \nBosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the chair. \nFROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair -- is taped to the chair she now sits in. \nBOSLEY Oh my God, let me help you. \nBosley hurries over, \"freeing her.\" Amused, Dylan lets him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one guard who was starting to revive. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KNOX COMPOUND - DAY \nKnox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting helicopter, followed closely by the Thin Man. \nKNOX Let's GO! \nThe helicopter quick ascends, just as... \nDYLAN (O.S.) Damn! \nTHE THREE ANGELS \nrun into the courtyard. \nNATALIE Don't worry, we'll get him. \nDYLAN You don't understand. He's got a pound of C-5 in that briefcase. \nALEX The question is, where's he headed? \nBOSLEY (O.S.) Miami. \nThe three angels turn to see Bosley, huffing and puffing his way into the courtyard. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 90. \nCONTINUED: BOSLEY (CONT'D) The man Knox is trying to kill has two general admission tickets to the Duke- Maryland game at Miami Arena. He's going to blow up the arena and kill his target. \nDYLAN Not that I don't believe you, but how exactly do you know all this? \nBOSLEY Because Angels, I was the one who purchased those tickets. \nNATALIE But Bosley, you HATE sports, why would you... (suddenly getting it) You didn't buy them for yourself. \n", "test3_true": "Bosley lowers his head.    Suddenly all the angels understand. \nANGELS CHARLIE! \nThey race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI - DAY \nRacing across the water, we find thong-clad BEACH BABES moving to a Latin beat. Art Deco buildings flank sun-kissed streets. The people are sexy, the daiquiris strong, and every night's a fiesta -- Welcome to MIAMI. \nRunning down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three angels pass THREE OTHER WOMEN rollerblading by: JILL MONROE, SABRINA DUNCAN and KELLY GARRETT. \nNothing is said, but a cool moment just happened. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LONG, LONG, HALLWAY -- LATER \nThe three Angels are running down a very long hallway.

With black hair. \nNATALIE No, silver hair. And tan. \nALEX He's not George Hamilton. \nNATALIE He's outside a lot. \nDYLAN We'll know him when we see him, that's for sure. \nALEX IF we see him. \nNATALIE How hard can it be to spot Charlie? \nThey slam into the doors, and we... CUT TO: \nINT. MIAMI ARENA - NIGHT \nWe reverse angle to reveal the inside of Miami Arena. The first thing that hits us is the WALL OF SOUND, the noise made by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy. \nThe next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the job facing the Angels. Hard to spot? The crowd is one, enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity. \nDYLAN Aw, shit. \nThe game is in progress, Duke vs. North Carolina, and it's a barn burner. A one point game with six minutes to go. BALL PLAYER pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two.

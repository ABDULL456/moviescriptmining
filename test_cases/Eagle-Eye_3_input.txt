EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT 
By a barricade, two CAPITOL COPS react as Jerry races towards them, bloody and panic-breathing, flashing Morgan's badge -- 
JERRY Listen to me, I've been working with a DHS officer, he gave me his badge, he was just killed, you gotta radio in a 10-13-- 
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1 Whoa whoa whoa, who the hell're you? 
JERRY You have to MOVE, right now! Radio it n i n! There's a bomb in the building! (they.look at each 
OTHER): You wanna be the guys who didn't do something?! 
ARIA'S SATâ¢.VIEW ZOOMS IN JUST AS THE OFFICER KEYS HIS WALKIE: 
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #2 Capitol, this is checkpoint 21, I've got a guy out here who says -- SCREECH! HISS! The radio cuts him off with piercing FEEDBACK -- as Jerry breaks into a RUN-- 
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1 Hey--!

INT. PENTAGON - COOLING ROOM - NIGHT 
Aria's temperature gauges are rising into red-line: 
SCOTT One more degree SUDDENLY the door bursts open and two GUARDS rush in with guns, SLAM them to the wall: 
GUARD #1 
FREEZE! HANDS! STEP AWAY FROM THE 
CONSOLE! 
LATESHA SCOTT -- WAIT WAIT WAIT -- -- my name's Scott Bowman, I have B-36 clearance, my ID's in my pocket -- The guard pulls out his ID, checks it, keys a shoulder-walkie: 
GUARD #1 (CONT'D) Unit 5, suspects in custody, but they have clearance -- The voice that responds over the walkie is ARIA'S: 
=ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.O.) Negative, credentials for Bowman and Simms have been revoked. Secure them in the mainframe tank, additional units en route to take custody -- 
LATESHA GUARDS -- that's not a person, it's -- shut up the computer, she's -- BE QUIET 
MALFUNCTIONING-'-- They're pushed into -- 
INT. PENTAGON - MAINFRAME TANK - DAY 
The water in Aria's mainframe tank is BUBBLING as a graphic shows the temp MAXING OUT. The door behind them suddenly LOCKS. The guards REACT -- one punches in a code, no good. 
GUARD #2 Control, maglocks just engaged in the south door, need and override... do you copy? 
CONTINUED: An ALARM blares. Scott sees PRESSURE GAUGES fluctuating wildly: 
SCOTT -- oh shit... she's upping the water pressure -- 
LATESHA -- what?! 
SCOTT She can't drain the tank... she's--gonna blow it. As the pressure in the tank intensifies, the frame begins to GROAN. The steel fitting SCREAMS with the enormous load -- a support rivet POPS OUT with an earsplitting KWANG! Zings across the room like a BULLET, pockmarking the wall.-- 
SCOTT (CONT'D) You gotta let me run a bypass on that door or in about 30 seconds this room's gonna be full of water! A fracture shoots across the glass. The guards are FRIGHTENED: 
GUARD #1` yeah, go, _ qo 
SCOTT 
I NEED SOMETHING TO PRY IT OPEN! Latesha whips out her keychain with the MINI ARMY KNIFE -- Scott pries off the panel:.as..the glass fracture GROWS -- he starts stripping wires as MORE'STEEL RIVETS pop loose, PING PING PING! It's like dodging bullets -- Scott SPARKS the wires together and the door starts to OPEN, but only a few inches before it STOPS. 
LATESHA Yoi.:can do it you can do it you can do it! 
SCOTT Stop telling me I can do it! The glass SPIDERWEBS MADLY -- he SPARKS the wires together again, the door opens a few more inches but: THE GLASS GIVES WAY AND THE TANK EXPLODES! WATER SURGES across the room, the guards are IMPALED by glass shards, Latesha and Scott SMASH HARD against the wall.., but the half-open door acts like a DRAIN, siphoning water into corridors... As the level lowers, we find Latesha and Scott on the ground, water runoff trailing around them, unmoving... 
INT. CAPITOL - FLOOR LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 
The Page leads Rachel to her seat, close to the President's lectern -- 
SENATE PAGE Anything else, Ms. Monaghan? 
RACHEL no, thank you... He smiles and leaves her there. She looks all around her, fighting the paranoia. What the hell's coming next?

WADE Tell me. 
CHICK Chub says you're fired. 
WADE He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning. 
CHICK He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY 
Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking into the receiver. Margie looks up from the KITCHEN table, an old newspaper in front of her. 
WADE What do you mean, you can't take me today? I told you -- 
The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams the phone down. 
MARGIE What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? 
WADE It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it. 
MARGIE I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? 
WADE Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit. 
Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes. 
WADE I'll get another job. People are going to need me. After this is over, they'll make me into a Goddamned hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll deliver. I'll be the best father who ever lived. You need me, even Pop, for Christ's sake, he needs me. This town needs me. Maybe now they think they can send me howling into a corner like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll be different soon. 
Margie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks, taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she thinks: just the same. 
Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives off. 
Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume. 
Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours himself a drink. 
WADE Leave the bottle out! 
Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer, goes toward the bathroom. 
In the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank. 
He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes and pulls. 
He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He takes another bite of whisky. 
Rolfe's voice plays over: 
ROLFE (V.O.) You will say I should have known terrible things were about to happen, and perhaps I should have. But even so, what could I have done by then? Wade never went inside. He lived almost wholly out there on his skin, with no interior space to retreat to, even in a crisis. 
Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks. 
Wade exits through the KITCHEN, snatching his coat.

EXT. BARN - DAY 
Wade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of gasoline from under the porch.

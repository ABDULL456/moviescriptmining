Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN. 
BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair, is an older female version of Billy himself. 
As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she looks as though she's barely keeping it together. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (between bites of cake) The place for Billy to be right now is at home with his family... 
Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down. 
BILLY'S MOTHER Excuse me. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST Oh, thank you. 
The Psychologist accepts a cup. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D) It'll take years for him to work through what happened, but the best way to open those doors is to surround him with things that are familiar... 
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact. 
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. 
He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER. 
His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder at the DRAWING that he's working on. 
BILLY'S MOTHER Are you sure you don't want some more cake? 
Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention. 
BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Billy... I- 
Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL. Billy never looks up. 
I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey. 
BILLY'S FATHER Only family and close friends are welcome here today. 
Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and wary of the stranger. 
COREY I understand... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that happened to Billy. And I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything happens for a reason... and it'll all work out in the end. 
Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO: 
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY 
...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone. 
Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE GYM. 
Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE... 
Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO: 
The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming... 
He swings back and forth... back and forth... 
ANGLE: PARK BENCH 
Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO: 
The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia... 
PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND... 
EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON 
A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS. 
The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END... 
EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON 
Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her: 
RANDY Corey...

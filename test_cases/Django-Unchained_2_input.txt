DJANGO Back at that plantation Candyland, there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode right past it. 
JANO You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits. 
DJANGO That's what's nice about this fortune, it's not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta earn it. 
JANO If you got something to say, say it. 
DJANGO The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang. 
JANO Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall? 
DJANGO Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang. There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices, Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons. And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at Candyland...laughin their ass off... cause they just got away with murder. 
(BEAT) But it don't hafta be that way. You and your mates could get that money. 
JANO Who pays the money? 
DJANGO The Court. 
JANO The Court? 
DJANGO The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by the way, the court don't give a damn about how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the back, from up on a hill, in the back of the head, in their sleep - don't matter. 
(CON'T) 
DJANGO 
(CON'T) Court doesn't care how you do it, just as long as you do it. 
JANO They.pay us to kill 'em? 
DJANGO No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the corpse. Get it? 
JANO I think so... . what did these jokers do again? 
DJANGO Killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket. Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck. He hands it to Jano. 
JANO What's this? 
DJANGO I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. Jano looks at the handbill. 
DJANGO Whatsamatter, can't you read? 
JANO I can read, I just don't have my glasses. I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run. 
DJANGO What about that cowboy fella in the lead? 
JANO Roy? 
DJANGO Can Roy read? 
JANO Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin read. I just don't got my glasses. 
CUT TO 
EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to the side of the road. 
IN THE CAGE Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of what they're watching. What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a piece of paper. 
INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks. 
DJANGO I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter. Yesterday as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my white German partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am. 
(TO ROY) You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you know I'm not suppose to be on this trip. But those four men, are still back there. They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs. And the last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back and gittin it. Django is damn convincing. 
ROY What's your deal? You tell us who they are and we let ya go? 
DJANGO I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred, and I'll point 'em out to you. He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs one little push.

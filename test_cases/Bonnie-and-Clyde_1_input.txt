C.W. He's lost, this here Texas Ranger. 
CLYDE claps BRYCE's hands behind his back, handcuffs him, spins him around. 
CLYDE (a little pissed) --he ain't lost...them banks are offerin' extra reward money fer us, and Frank figured on easy pickin's, didn't you? (he suddenly knocks Bryce's hat off) Didn't you? 
BRYCE flinches involuntarily.  BUCK suddenly grows wary at CLYDE's mood.  CLYDE leans into BRYCE, looking up. 
CLYDE --Now you ain't hardly doin' your job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us. 
He suddenly hefts BRYCE's huge bulk onto the fender. 
BUCK (trying to be casual) Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so personal. 
CLYDE (to Bryce) Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that. 
BLANCHE looks very uncomfortable.  She starts to say something, but BUCK intervenes. 
BUCK Like how, Clyde?-- 
A tense moment.  CLYDE can't think of anything right away. 
C.W. (trying to be helpful) Shoot him. 
BONNIE shoots C.W. an angry glance--it's just what the gang doesn't want. 
C.W. (trying again) ...hang him?... 
Reaction--BONNIE carefully gauging the moment to intervene. 
BONNIE (suddenly) --uh-uh.  Take his picture. 
CLYDE's not sure he's heard right.  Neither is C.W. 
C.W. Take his picture? 
BONNIE (pointedly ignoring C.W., brightly) Then we'll let the newspapers have it--so's everyone can see Captain Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers with the Barrow gang-- (moving demurely to Bryce) --and all bein' just as friendly as pie. 
BUCK (grasping possibilities immediately) ...yeah, yeah... 
BONNIE (continuing right on, coyly picking up Bryce's gun from grill) --why we 'bout the friendliest folks in the world.  Texas Ranger waves his big ol' gun at us, and we just welcome him like he's one of our own. 
CLYDE (grinning widely) Buck, get the Kodak! 
BUCK (relieved and excited) Hot dog! 
CLYDE (to Bryce) We're mighty proud to have a Texas Ranger in the family. 
BRYCE is obviously not pleased with this turn of events. Following dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc.  A sense of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to exact. 
New angle.  BUCK is fiddling with the camera, setting up the shot with CLYDE.  BUCK's following speech should be heard, b.g., to CLYDE's speech below it. 
BUCK ...keep him set on the hood, there...more to the sun, like that...yeah...when all his ranger friends see this...I bet he's gonna wish he was dead! 
CLYDE (to Bryce) ...see what come o' your mischief?...not doin' your job? Down in Duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns...you're s'posed to be protectin' them from us, and they're protectin' us from you. (giggling) --don't make sense, do it? 
BUCK C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie first.  Move into him, right close, right friendly. 
CLYDE All righty (to Bryce, whose hands are tied, hemmed in by them both) Don't move, now, hear? 
CLYDE grandly puts an arm on BRYCE's shoulder, BONNIE, looking up admiringly from the other side.  BUCK takes the picture.  BONNIE immediately hops onto the hood, next to BRYCE. 
BONNIE How's this? "Captain Bryce and new found friend." 
She coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a big kiss on him while still ogling camera. 
CLYDE ...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get it... 
BUCK ...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it. 
Quite suddenly BRYCE, whose simmering intensity we should be more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on Bonnie.  BONNIE half-screams in disgust, but CLYDE is on top of BRYCE in a flash, half-strangling on his own fury.  He pulls BRYCE off the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily like a lasso.  BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by the force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men falling, spinning.  BRYCE rises shakily.  He tries to walk away.  CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him out into the water.  BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking out of the shallows and goes down.  CLYDE is on top of him. 
Meanwhile, BUCK has rushed down into the water, tries to pull CLYDE off BRYCE. 
BUCK (frantic) I got the picture.  I got the picture...

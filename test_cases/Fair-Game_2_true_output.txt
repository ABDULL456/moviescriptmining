-- SLAP! -- 
The paper is opened to a centre page feature of George Bush. There is Hafiz's photocopy. 
CPD AGENT ..a field team picked it up and D and D'd it at the safe house.. 
In a cheap hotel room, under a broken ceiling fan another Asian man scans the image into a laptop, behind him the BALD COMMUTER strikes a match and burns the original. 
INT. VALERIE'S OFFICE, CPD LANGLEY. DAY 
Valerie, in her cramped office with half a dozen field agents, briefs from a diagram on a white board. 
VALERIE We have a shipment. A holding company in Pakistan asks Tabir to purchase 200 un-identified units, trackable by part numbers, from.. 
ALI Teludyne Electronics of Lowell Massachusetts.. 
EXT. TELUDYNE INDUSTRIES. LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS. DAY 
Two men (from the briefing) in a WHIPPED CHEVY watch a red truck leave an industrial unit in the suburbs of Lowell. 
VALERIE (V.O.) The shipment is delivered to Goza Tech in Secaucus, New Jersey... 
EXT. GOZA TECHNOLOGIES, 600 MEADOWLANDS PKWY NJ. NIGHT 
The red truck turns into a low grey set of prefab buildings in a business park. The CHEVY watches a forklift truck lift a single pallet out and deliver it into the warehouse. 
VALERIE (V.O) There it's bundled in with a second shipment of legitimate electronic parts, and documentation attached that masks its point of origin. 
INT. BONDED CUSTOMS WAREHOUSE. PORT NEWARK. NIGHT 
Valerie, Ali, and the rest of the team walk through the neon lit maze of packing cases and pallets towards a concerned looking superintendent. 
VALERIE V/O Its then dispatched as medical electronics en route to a company in Johannesburg South Africa. First it spends the night at a bonded customs warehouse in the Port of Jersey. That's the intercept. 
SUPERINTENDENT Can I help you? 
VALERIE shows ID to the owner. 
VALERIE Sir, we're from U.S customs. Can I take a moment of your time? 
He takes off his cap and looks sick. An agent cracks the packing case with a crowbar: white cardboard boxes. Valerie draws a Buck knife and slices it open, rumaging in polystyrene chips and comes out with a Coke sized white plastic cylinder with two contacts at one end. 
ALI What the hell is that? 
Valerie looks at the object. 
CUT TO: 
A BLINDING FLASH OF PURE WHITE LIGHT becomes A GIANT BULBOUS CLOUD of rolling hellfire. It mushrooms twenty thousand feet over the New Mexico Desert. An awesome sight. 
DR FORSTER (O.S.) A spark gap is a high energy voltage-controlled switching device. 
INT. LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY. EXHIBITION CENTER. DAY 
As a gaggle of schoolkids watch the sixty year old footage of the Manhattan Project on a plasma screen, Valerie passes through the compound with DR FORSTER, a geeky scientist in his 30s. He holds the intercepted component. 
DR FORSTER To detonate a nuclear bomb you need to be able to switch high voltage, high current electrical circuits at very high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond. 
They pass through a security door to the labs. 
DR FORSTER The extremely short rise times are achieved by discharging a low- induct, high-voltage capacitor through the spark gap into the bridge wire inside the warhead. The ballpark is 5 kilovolt and 1 mf for the capacitor, with a peak current between 500 and 1000 amperes... 
VALERIE Does it have other uses? 
DR FORSTER High speed photography, industrial photo-chemistry. Zapping kidney stones.Is someone out there building the fire train for a nuclear device component by component? (Shakes his head) You're talking one helluva complicated process. This guy is just one tiny piece in the jigsaw. 
She hands him a piece of paper. 
VALERIE This is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last 3 years. Tilt tables. timing equipment. High speed monitioring devices. 
DR FORSTER (Reading) Quartz rate sensors. Calibration units... (Takes off his glasses.) It's not kidney stones. Thank god you stopped this. 
VALERIE I'm not stopping it. 
DR FORSTER (Confused) I don't understand.. 
INT. COUNTER PROLIFERATION DIVISION. LANGLEY. DAY. 
Valerie's team are in a briefing room. 
VALERIE We keep the transaction live. Trace it all the way to the end user.

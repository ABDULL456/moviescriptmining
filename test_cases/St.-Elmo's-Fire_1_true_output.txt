DALE (V.0.) Yes...? Kirbo cannot bring himself to speak. 
DALE (V.0.) Hello. Kirbo is dying to speak, but can't. He quickly charges out of sight. 
74 EXT. DALE'S BUILDING - NIGHT 74 
Dale opens her second-story window and looks out. She searches the night and is about to close her window when a sudden flash gets her attention. Is 75 EXT. ALLEY 75 Hidden by the night, Kirbo has just snapped Dale's picture. He charges down the alley and leaps on his bike. 
76 EXT. DALE'S BUILDING 76 
puzzled and pissed, closes her window. 
76A INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY 76A 
On screen "MANHATTAN." Woody talks into a microphone. 
WOODY (V.0.) An idea for a short story, about um, people in Manhattan who, uh, who are constantly creating these real, uh, unnecessary neurotic problems for themselves 'cause it keeps them from dealing with, uh, more unsolvable terrifying problems about, uh, the universe.

76A CONTINUED: 76A 
R AUDIENCE Kirbo and Kevin watch. 
KEVIN Not just in Manhattan, Woodman. Kirbo quickly pulls out his camera and snaps a picture of the screen. 
76B INT. LAUNDROMAT - LATE DAY 76B 
Kirbo and Kevin do laundry. 
KEVIN You can't keep ringing doorbells and running away, calling her and hanging up. What are you afraid of? 
KIRBO Rejection. Total and devastating. As long as she hasn't rejected me, there's hope. 
KEVIN I have lived with a secret obsession many years myself. However, I realize the other person has no interest in me -- so I pursue my career which is going even more unsuccessfully. 
KIRBO Who are you in love with? 
KEVIN I don't have to share everything with you... 
(GRABBING LAUNDRY) My underwear is enough. Kirbo, if you must pursue this narcissistic mortification, that you have decided to call love, then you must ask her out on a proper date. Like a young god. Like Alec, our leader, would. 
KI RBO Alec has balls. He sees things with his balls. A ball's-eye view so to speak. Having taken their stuff out of the dryer they leave.

KIRBO 
'Fluff and Fold,' buddy. Soon as I get some dough, I'm goin' 'Fluff and Fold.' 
76C EXT. STREET - DAY 76C 
They move through the busy street together passing some double Dutch champions. 
KEVIN You'll go fluff and fold, someday. Whereas I will still be writing obits. I can't even come up with a decent piece for the paper to show my editor. 
KIRBO I can't help you with your writer's block -- until I see that look in Dale Biberman's eyes. The look that says she knows I'm the one for her. 
KEVIN Kirbo, what about all the other women you were going out with? 
KIRBO They weren't women. They were practice. 
KEVIN You'll never catch me making a fool ofmyself over a beautiful woman. I know what they're really made of. Watch this. 
(TO APPROACHING 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL) What's the meaning of life? 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL Leave me alone. 
KEVIN The defense rests. They disappear into their building.

ENGLISH JOURNALIST Will you support the war effort, Mr. Gandhi? 
An exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders. 
GANDHI I -- I have demanded rights as a British citizen, it is therefore my duty to help in the defense of the British Empire. 
He smiles uncertainly again. As he turns he is face to face with an American reporter. 
AMERICAN REPORTER What are you going to do now that you're back in India? 
GANDHI I don't know... I don't know... 
An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him. 
SECOND INDIAN REPORTER As an Indian woman how could you accept the indignity of prison? 
Gandhi half-twists to hear Ba's answer, but his arm is taken by a young Indian (Nehru) in elegant European clothes. Another garland is thrown over his shoulders. 
NEHRU Please, Mr. Gandhi. 
Featuring Ba. Offhand, her eyes on Gandhi ahead. 
BA My dignity comes from following my husband. 
She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi. Charlie helps to guide her. 
Featuring Gandhi. The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little flower-covered platform. We see a banner: THE CONGRESS PARTY WELCOMES GANDHI. 
NEHRU (he too speaks with an Oxbridge accent) Just a few words -- then we'll get you to civilization. 
He grins. He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the platform. Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd. Finally he speaks out. 
GANDHI I -- I am glad to be home. (A little round of applause.) I -- I thank you for your greeting. 
He makes the pranam and starts for the steps. The crowd is a little disappointed, but they manage a cheer and applause. 
Nehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man (Patel). They exchange a wry glance, "Not exactly a world- beater." 
A car door slams. The camera pulls back. Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down. He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack. An Indian chauffeur rides in front. The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba. 
NEHRU We'll follow with your wife -- don't worry, everything's arranged. 
He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion. 
PATEL'S CAR - STREETS OF BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY 
With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off. He finally turns to Patel. 
GANDHI Who is that young man? 
PATEL That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something. 
There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise that they are for him -- waves tentatively. Patel waves too but he eyes Gandhi rather critically. 
PATEL I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero. 
GANDHI I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel. 
PATEL Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore. 
GANDHI (a beat; still hesitant) No. 
They have come to a main thoroughfare. A crowd still lines the streets but it is thin and around and between we see groups of desperate poor, parked on the pavement, staring with blank curiosity at the passing car, but too listless and too out of touch to move from their little squatters' patches. 
Patel looks at Gandhi's clothes rather disapprovingly. 
PATEL The new Military Governor of the North West Province was on that ship. Too bad you came back Third Class -- he might have been impressed by a successful barrister who had outmaneuvered General Smuts. 
Gandhi is staring at the street. From his point of view we hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari. Another hollow-faced child leans against her. 
GANDHI (leadenly) Yes... I'm sure... 
PATEL'S GARDEN - EXTERIOR - DAY 
A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn. A woman in a sumptuous silk sari is trying to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate -- silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa. 
A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman (Mrs. Nehru) stands next to her distinguished husband (Motilal Nehru). 
MRS. NEHRU (wittily) No, I leave practical matters to my husband and revolution to my son... 
She nods lightly toward Nehru. 
Featuring Nehru who is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, ascetic looking, but dressed impeccably (Jinnah). The other with a haunting face -- beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical (Prakash -- whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination). 
NEHRU Mr. Jinnah, our joint host, member of Congress, and the leader of the Muslim League and Mr. Prakash, who I fear is awaiting trial for sedition and inducement to murder. 
Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash. Prakash grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi. 
PRAKASH I have not actually pulled a trigger, Mr. Gandhi, I have simply written that if an Englishman kills an Indian for disobeying his law, then it is an Indian's duty to kill an Englishman for enforcing his law in a land that is not his. 
Gandhi nods... 
GANDHI It is a clever argument; I am not sure it will produce the end you desire. 
He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa. 
JINNAH (testingly) We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi. 
GANDHI (a pause) I -- 
Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others. 
CHARLIE May I? Mohan -- I would like you to meet someone. 
Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes. Behind him we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society. 
As Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru and Prakash watch him clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes. 
NEHRU He told the press he would support the British in the war. 
PRAKASH (acidly) That's non-violence for you. 
JINNAH Is he a fool? 
Nehru grins slowly, thoughtfully. 
NEHRU I'm not certain... But I wouldn't be surprised.

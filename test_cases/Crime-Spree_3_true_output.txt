In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black guy as he finds Ellwood's body. 
INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY 
Raymond and Julien approach the counter.   Raymond is nervous. 
RAYMOND (in French) I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar. 
JULIEN (in French) Relax. It will be fine. 
They arrive at the counter. The RENTAL AGENT, a man in his 30's looks up at them with a smile. 
CAR RENTAL AGENT Hello. 
RAYMOND Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton, Ohio and I would like to rent a car with my visa gold card. 
Raymond smiles, a big, friendly, completely over exaggerated smile. Julien looks at him and rolls his eyes. The Rental Agent walks down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone. 
CAR RENTAL AGENT (into phone) I got a couple French guys here trying to rent a car. (listens) Sure. I can stall them. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 
Vinny is in bed, his arm in a cast and sling. His wife ANGIE, 30's, big hair, loud clothes. She sits on the bed feeding him. His two kids, RICHIE, 8, and TOMMY 10, sit off to the side. Zammito enters. 
ZAMMITO Angie, how you doin'? 
She kisses him. Vinny stares blankly at his brother. Zammito takes a step back, looks her up and down. He lays on the charm. 
ZAMMITO Hey, you're looking good. There's something different about you. You get a boob job or something? 
ANGIE I've gained weight. 
ZAMMITO Yeah, well, it suits you. 
Zammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello. 
ZAMMITO Hey Tommy. 
RICHIE I'm Richie.    He's Tommy. 
ZAMMITO Whatever. 
Zammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and peels one off. 
ZAMMITO Angie, take the kids down to the gift shop and buy 'em something. I need a word with Vinny. 
Angie looks at the money. 
ANGIE (flatly) Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we buy? 
She takes the kids and leaves. 
ZAMMITO She seems pleasant enough. 
VINNY She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs. 
ZAMMITO That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does. 
Zammito sits on the edge of the bed. 
ZAMMITO So, I just come by to see how you're doin'? 
VINNY You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'? 
ZAMMITO Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay? 
VINNY Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie? 
ZAMMITO I don't want anything. (More) 
ZAMMITO (Cont'd) I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day. 
VINNY A little? 
ZAMMITO Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you. 
VINNY You gonna forget about the money I owe you? 
ZAMMITO What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that. 
Zammito's cell phone rings. 
ZAMMITO (into phone) Yeah? (his face hardens) I'm on my way. 
Zammito hangs up. 
ZAMMITO I got something I gotta do. I'm glad we had this talk. Heal. Get better. Let me know when you're ready to start.

EXT. BAYNARD'S BOAT - SAME TIME The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS rocket. The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to the rail, carrying the Baretta. HALLENBECK Wait here. He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready. 
INT. SENATOR'S BOAT - COCKPIT Enters the cockpit. What's left of the roof is bullet- pocked. The navigator is dead. Slumped over the controls. Joe pulls him off the panel. KILLS the ENGINE. 
INT. MAIN CABIN Joe bursts inside.    Hard and fast.   Gun leveled. No need. It's a slaughterhouse. The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead. The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table. Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body. Stares into the wide-open eyes. HALLENBECK Sorry, Cal.    Life in the big city. CUT TO: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT The senator's boat pulls up to the dock.     No one is around. 
EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye. HALLENBECK Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it? DARIAN (crying) They're gonna kill you...! 
HALLENBECK Are you kidding? I do this for a living. (hands her a twenty) Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back. (beat) I love you. She throws her arms around him. CUT TO: 
INT. RENTAL SUBARU - DRIVING - NIGHT All business now. Deadly serious. Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield.    Grim. Tense. In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase. JIMMY Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside? HALLENBECK Quit being a fuckin' killjoy. He cuts the headlights.   Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster. HALLENBECK Come on.   We've got some things to pick up. 
EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE (WEST L.A.) - NIGHT They creep across a suburban lawn, hugging the shadows. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.       Deserted. Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants, nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in scorched tatters. Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop. Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points: 
THEIR POV A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house... There is a man slouched inside. Smoking. 
BACK TO SCENE HALLENBECK Shit.   Someone's staking me out. JIMMY (clears his throat) Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller. Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look. CUT TO: 
EXT. COASTAL WATERS - NIGHT A Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/ chopper crash. A uniformed ENSIGN shines a light on the dark waters. ENSIGN I think I got someone!   Four o'clock! 
MILO is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as: 
ANOTHER ANGLE He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready. CUT TO:

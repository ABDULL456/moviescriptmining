ZACH Mom? 
Melanie pops her head back in the car. 
MELANIE What? 
ZACH I'm not thirteen. It's against the law to leave me alone in a car until I'm thirteen. 
MELANIE Come on. 
Zach EXITS.

EXT. AKRON'S CANAL PARK - DAY 
John's phone RINGS. He ignores the call. 
JOHN I had priorities. I understood what it meant to have an attention span. 
RICK You could focus? 
JOHN I was the King of Focus. 
RICK The Duke of Diligence? 
JOHN The Count of Concentration. 
Rick is still looking at John when he hears the CRACK of the bat. 
RICK Duck. 
JOHN Huh? 
Rick ducks. John appears perplexed. John's POV: A foul ball is screaming in his direction. Too late: The ball strikes John in the face knocking him out of his seat. Rick recovers and continues to snack on his popcorn. 
RICK The Polestar Prince.

Melanie carries a soda and a bag of chips. Zach stands at the cooler looking through the glass. 
MELANIE Did you decide? ZACH I want Coke. 
MELANIE Get one. 
ZACH No, Pepsi. (A beat) No, Seven-Up. Maybe root beer. 
MELANIE Make up your mind already. 
ZACH So many choices. A glance to her watch.

EXT. MAIN STREET - AKRON OHIO - DAY 
The game is over. Rick and John stand at the front gate. The exiting CROWD flows around them. John holds an ice pack to the side of his face. 
JOHN I'm just saying grow up. You can't keep drifting. RICK I thought I did grow up... 
JOHN When you got married? 
RICK Yeah... 
JOHN You matured a little. 
RICK It's a process. 
JOHN No Bueller, it's a decision. One you need to make. You can't keep running without direction. If you don't know where you're going you'll never get what you want. CUT TO:

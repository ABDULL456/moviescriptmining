ill eyes him. The men stare down, Bill deciding if he can trust him. Then -- he clicks "talk" on the radio. 
BILL Change of plan. Bring them back unharmed. 
Bill uncuffs Shane. 
EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY 
The vehicles race, Chun just inches from the kids' tail. He tries to pass them on the right. It's like a chariot race, Chun zooming by, half on the sidewalk, to cut them off! 
INT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS 
Todd scrambles into the back seat. He does something we can't see, as Zoe drives. 
ZOE What's taking you? 
TODD Don't wait for me! 
The sedan pulls up beside them. Zoe makes a very lewd gesture at him. It throws Mr. Chun off for a beat. 
TODD (CONT'D) Now! 
Zoe floors it, Mr. Chun is now face to face with Todd -- who throws a dirty diaper into the his face. Mr. Chun swerves and almost wrecks. Lulu starts PELTING Mr. Chun with debris: milk cartons, crayons, orange peels. M R. CHUN Aah!     HEY -- 
Rubbish clobbers him. Exasperated, Mr. Chun ROLLS UP his window, then POUNDS the gas! Faster! About to pass... 
Zoe looks over. Chun is pointing a gun!             She suddenly PULLS the emergency brake. 
WIDE 
RRRRRRRR!!    The Van SPINS into a squealing 360. 
Mr. Chun SCREAMS, disoriented, and loses control. 
In the van, Peter laughs. 
PETER Wheee! 
The Van spins madly. The sedan skids and PLOWS into a store window. CRASH!! The kids cheer, triumphant. 
INT. SECRET VAULT - MOMENTS LATER 
Shane scopes out the vault. The walls and ceilings are covered with high-tech weaponry. Mrs. Chun holds Julie. Bill waits impatiently. Shane is figuring his options... 
SHANE Anybody got any perfume?          Hair spray... breath freshener... 
A bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of Binaca. Shane SQUIRTS it, revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing LASER BEAMS. 
Shane steps forward. He speaks aloud, confidently: 
J 
B 
B 
SHANE (CONT'D) Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler! 
Bill reacts, puzzled. 
SHANE (CONT'D) The key is the kid's names. Watch. 
Shane steps forward - ZAP! The floor tile SHOCKS HIM, sending him flying backwards. Bill laughs. Shane gets up, in pain. 
ILL You think this is a game?! S SHANE But... That was the code! I swear! I saw Plummer use it on his briefcase. 
BILL Code or no code, go get it -- now. 
ill cocks his gun. Sweat drips down Shane's face. He mists the air to see the beams: He steps forward, over one beam and ducking under another -- he miscalculates: a BURST OF FLAME blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow torch, Shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees. 
JULIE (to Bill) You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance. 
CLOSE-UP - SHANE 
Shane's thinks. He notices a GROOVE carved in the floor, not quite centered to the room. He feels the Groove. Something she said... 
SHANE (thinking) Haven't got a chance. 
Shane feels the Groove in the floor. He thinks. He looks up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor). 
SHANE (CONT'D) (sings softly to himself) ... When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you haven't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.

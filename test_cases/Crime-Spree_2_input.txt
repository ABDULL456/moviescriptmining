Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito. 
ZAMMITO You bleed on me, I'll kill ya. 
Vinny takes a step back. 
ZAMMITO What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? (to Joey) What'd I say to him? 
JOEY "TWO TONS" You said don't do it, boss. 
ZAMMITO That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate. 
VINNY Frankie, I -- 
ZAMMITO -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. (to Joey and Nicky) Break his arm. 
Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes. 
VINNY Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother! 
ZAMMITO That's why we're only breaking one arm. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON 
The table is littered with plates.   Sophie has sketched out a diagram of a house on her napkin. 
SOPHIE There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom. 
JULIEN I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem. 
SAMI After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window. 
DANIEL (impressed) Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door. 
JULIEN What about transportation? 
SOPHIE You can use my car. 
DANIEL Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one. 
RAYMOND No problem. 
SAMI When do we go? 
SOPHIE Tonight. 
DANIEL Tonight? 
SOPHIE I know they won't be home tonight. 
SAMI You ever hear of jet lag? 
SOPHIE Take a nap. 
EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar of loud MUSIC. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch smoking a joint. 
JULIEN What the hell is that? 
WAYNE Neighbors.    They do this all the time. 
SAMI I can't even hear myself think. 
ZERO How are we supposed to sleep with this noise? 
SOPHIE I've asked them a hundred times to keep in down. They don't listen. 
RAYMOND I will talk to them. 
Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing. 
WAYNE Yeah.   Right. 
SOPHIE Not a good idea. 
RAYMOND It's just a matter of communication. 
Raymond leaves. 
EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE. Behind him are two other rough-looking men. 
RAYMOND (cheerfully; loudly over the music) Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting next door and I was wondering if you could make your music a little less loud.

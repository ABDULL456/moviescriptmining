EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY                           1 \nHigh in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with clouds. \nAs we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C. \nDissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling building. Computer type quickly bleeps on: \nC.I.A. Headquarters Langley, Virginia \n2   INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY                                        2 \nWe track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of someone walking down the well polished hallway. \n3   INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY                                      3 \nWe hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer DeBakey Smith. \nPALMER Ozzie.    Sit down. \nOsbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped shirt and bow tie. \nOSBOURNE Palmer.   What's up. \nPALMER You know Peck, and Olson. \nThe two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at Osbourne, who is surprised to see them. \nOSBOURNE Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox. \nOLSON Yeah, hiyah. \nOSBOURNE Aren't you with...aren't you, uh... \nPalmer jumps in: \nPALMER Yeah, that's right. Oz, look. There's no easy way to say this. We're taking you off the Balkans desk. \nOSBOURNE You're----what? Why? \nPALMER In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely. \nOSBOURNE ...What?    No discussion, just----you're out? \nPALMER Well, we're having the discussion now Oz. This doesn't have to be unpleasant. \nOSBOURNE Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about? \nA beat. \nOSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... And why is Olson here? \nAnother uncomfortable beat. \nPALMER ... Look, Ozzie---- \nOSBOURNE What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I know it's not my work. \nPALMER Ozzie---- \nOSBOURNE I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it---- \nPALMER Oz, things are not going well.      As you know. \nPECK You have a drinking problem. \nStunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck. \nAt length: \nOSBOURNE I have a drinking problem. \nPALMER This doesn't have to be unpleasant. We found you something in State. It's a, uh... \nHe gropes, uncomfortable. \nPALMER (CONT'D) ... It's a lower clearance level. Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're not terminating you. \nOSBOURNE (quietly) This is an assault. \nPECK Come on, Ozzie. \nOSBOURNE This is an assault. I have a drinking problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon! \nPECK Ozzie---- \nOSBOURNE Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest! \nPalmer nods at Olson. \nKatie tries to separate the two men by including Doug Magruder. \nKATIE Harry works with the Marshalls'                       * Service.                                              * \nPink Revision 8/14/07 6A. \nDOUG MAGRUDER Ah. I'm on the legislative side, I                 * work with Senator Hobby.                           * \nPink Revision 8/14/07 7. \nHARRY                                       * Used to work for Treasury, but I                      * didn't go over to Homeland Security.                  * I'm with the Marshalls.                               * \nOSBOURNE If you want he'll show you his great big gun. \nHARRY Very amusing. The gun is actually no big deal. Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon. \nOSBOURNE Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist. \nHARRY What?   I don't have a psychiatrist. \nDOUG MAGRUDER Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic. I'm on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do you also carry a gun? \nHarry laughs. \nHARRY Sandy writes children's books. \nSANDY I write children's books---- \nHARRY Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who---- \nChoking on piece of cheese, coughing \nHARRY (CONT'D) ...Who Lives In The Rotunda.     Excuse me. \nTINA Those are wonderful!    My nieces and nephews---- \nHARRY Yeah, it's a beloved series. You wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh. Are you sure this is goat cheese? \nKATIE Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry? \nHARRY I'm sorry----was I---- \nKATIE Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the crudit\u00e9s. \n6    INT. COX KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       6 \nThey enter. \nHARRY Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he. \nHe looks down at the floor.        He stamps. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Nice floors. \nKATIE Knows what? \nHarry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures. Absently: \nHARRY About us, he knows about us.          Little prick. \nKATIE Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing. \nHarry is staring down at the linoleum again. \nHARRY What is that, forbo? \nA6   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                            A6 \nA car drives by. \n7   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT                                      7 \nHarry driving, his wife next to him. \nA long beat. \nFinally: \nHARRY What a horse's ass. \nSANDY I don't know why we see them. \nHarry shrugs. \nHARRY Well, she's all right. \nSANDY She is a cold, stuck-up bitch. \nHarry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't. \nThey drive. \n8   INT. COX MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                               8 \nKATIE \nShe is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more. \nWhite hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law- book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is Bogus Terikhian. \nTERIKHIAN ... I know this kind of man.    We've seen this. \nWider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an assistant. \nTERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you. And he will. He will. \nKATIE Yes. This is my fear. He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but... \nTERIKHIAN Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves around. Not unheard-of. But. You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet? \nKATIE No. \nTERIKHIAN Well that's good.   Because first you should get all his financials. Before he's forewarned. Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh... \nHe waggles his hands, groping for the word. \nTERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... Feet. \nHe shrugs. \nTERIKHIAN (CONT'D) ... And hopefully everything will work out. He will reform. But! If not: forewarned is forearmed. \n12   INT. COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12 \nOsbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out- flung, like Marat in his bathtub. \nA long still beat.   A clock ticks. \nAbruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a microcassette recorder. \nOSBOURNE We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. We thought of the Agency less as... less as... \nThe thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and wanders around the room, glassy-eyed. \nHe suddenly raises the microcassette again. \nOSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us. In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service. Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um... \"Murrow's Boys,\" the fabled----in a different---- \nHe suddenly stops, head cocked, listening. \nFaintly, a ringing phone. \n13   INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY                                13 \nAt the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that juts over the bottom half of the stairwell. \nThe phone is louder here. \n14   INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY                                         14 \nA semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up: \nMACHINE You have reached The Cox Group... \nOsbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered feet toward the phone. \nMACHINE (CONT'D) ... We can't answer your call right now. Please leave a---- \nOSBOURNE (heavy breathing) Hello. \nHe eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.    A listening beat. \nOSBOURNE (CONT'D) ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her number... No, upstairs...No she's not, but leave it on her machine. \n15   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER                                     15 \nWe are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime game show. \nA few beats of the show. \nRoaring laughter from the studio audience.     Mild chuckle from Osbourne in the foreground. \n16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16 \nTicking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and then stops, and looks off. \nThe ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate clock face Two or three minutes to five. \nOsbourne stares for a long beat. \n17   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                             17 \nOSBOURNE \nShoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray. \nHe pours coke sizzling onto the ice. \nHe pauses for a long beat. \nHe takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet. \nHe pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass. \nHe looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring: \nCHAD Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like, numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers... And numbers. I think                  * that's the shit, man. The raw intelligence. \nTED I am not touching this.    I want this out of here. \nCHAD Wul... Throw it out? \nLINDA You can't do that! You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room. \nCHAD Put a note up? Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA shit? I don't think so. \nTED Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable with this. I want this                   * out of Hardbodies... \nAs he backs out of the office: \nTED (CONT'D) ... We're running a gym here! \nChad swivels around. \nCHAD Look,   Manolo... \nHe zippers his lip. \nCHAD (CONT'D) ...you didn't find this. \nMANOLO I found it on the floor there. \nCHAD Yeah, I know, but\u00ad \nMANOLO Right there on the floor there.      Lie- een there. \n46   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                                            46 \nCLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR \nA dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a quiet Chevy Chase street. \nHarry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of the back seat of the station wagon. \n47   EXT. CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DAY                                      47 \nHarry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the driveway of the suburban house. \n48   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  48 \nHarry is struggling through the      front door with the length of pipe. \nWe hear his wife call down from upstairs: \nSANDY Harry?      Is that you? \nHARRY Yeah, yeah, it's me. \nHe takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar, sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door behind him. \n49   INT. CELLAR - NIGHT                                               49 \nHarry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise. \nHis home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement. There is also haphazard storage. \nYellow Revision 8/24/07 34. \nOne shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker: \"Oliver in the Oval Office,\" \"Yea and Nay for Oliver,\" \"Point of Order, Oliver!\" \nHarry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware. He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly back and forth, nicely balanced. \n50   INT. MONKEY DAVE'S - NIGHT                                     50 \nLinda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's. To a waitress: \nLINDA Absolut Saketini, please? \nTED Just a Tab. \nLINDA You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling. \nTED Whoa! There's a payroll company, you know. They don't just advance people money. They just don't do that. I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I                           * authorize it, but that's not going to mean anything to them. \nLINDA Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted! \nTED You're a beautiful woman!   You don't need\u00ad \nLINDA Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body! I---- \nTED I think it's a very beautiful----it's not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body---- \nYellow Revision 8/24/07 35. \nLINDA That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel. \nTED Oh come on! \nLINDA I am trying to get back in circulation. I have appetites and so forth, and, uh---- \nTED Well there's a lot of guys who'd like you just the way you are. \nLINDA Yeah----losers! \nLINDA Uh-huh. \nCHAD Not what we know. \nLINDA Uh-huh. \nCHAD And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate. \nLINDA I have tap water \nCHAD Are you kidding? \nLINDA How did you find out who he is? \nCHAD Sources. \nLINDA What do you mean sources? \nCHAD Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water? \nHe rises and heads for the kitchen. \nCHAD (CONT'D) ... You know how far this is from my place? \nLINDA How do you know his name? \nCHAD I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie. \nLINDA Uh-huh. \nChad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging. \nCHAD I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder. \nLINDA Omygod! \nChad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he rolls across his forehead. \nCHAD Shall we give him a tinkle? \nYellow Revision 8/24/07 40. \nLINDA Omygod, why? \nCHAD Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not. \nLINDA Oh, wow. \nCHAD Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            * Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary. \n54   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                        54 \nChad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching numbers into a wall phone. In the background we see Linda watching him from the living room couch. \nA beat. \nWe hear the call ring through. \nThe click of the connection being made, and Chad silently gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick up her extension. \nCHAD Hello? \n55   INT. OSBOURNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     55 \nHe has the phone pressed groggily to his ear. \nOSBOURNE Hello? \nCHAD Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox? \nOSBOURNE Yes----uh----Who is this? \nCHAD Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox? \nOSBOURNE Who is this? What time is it?     Who are you? \nCHAD I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried. \nOSBOURNE Worried? \nCHAD About the security.     Of your shit. \nA beat. \nOSBOURNE What on earth are you talking about? Who am I speaking to? \nKatie stirs in bed. \nKATIE Who is it? \nCHAD Your files----your documents. I know these documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing. \nOSBOURNE What documents? What are you talking about? \nCHAD ... Osbourne Cox? \nOSBOURNE (explosive) Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!     Who the fuck\u00ad \nLINDA And us in the driver's seat. This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these. You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant. \nCHAD Yuh-huh. \nLINDA Or this happens. \nCHAD Right. \nLINDA And right now this has happened. \nCHAD Yup.   It sure has. \nLINDA This could put a big dent in my surgeries. \nCHAD Big time. \n58   INT. PFARRER CELLAR - DAWN                                           58 * \nSANDY PFARRER \nWe are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw: \nSANDY Honey! \nNo answer.    The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel. Louder: \nSANDY (CONT'D) Honey! \nBlue Revision 8/1/07 46. \nThe whine hums down. \nHARRY'S VOICE Huh? \nSANDY My cab is here, I'm off.      Mystery man. \nHer point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower body as he throws a drape over his project. He emerges from the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it. \nSANDY (CONT'D) ... What is that thing? \nHARRY Oh baby.     Top secret. \nHe comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... You're gonna knock 'em dead. \nAt the top of the stairs he kisses her. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... How many cities? \nSANDY Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago. \nHe picks up her bag and they go out. \nHARRY Why do they always have you do Seattle. Not a big market. \nSANDY I don't know, lots of independent bookstores. Rains all day, what are people gonna do. \nHARRY I can think of a couple of things. \nSANDY You can think of one thing. \n59   EXT. PFARRER HOUSE - DAWN                                         59 * \nThey are walking to a black Town Car idling curbside. \nPink Revision 8/14/07 47. \nSANDY It better be the Peninsula. The money I make for them. Are you gonna be okay? \nHARRY I'll be sad. But I'll be okay. \nSANDY Not too sad.. \nHARRY Just the right amount. \nHe kisses her. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... I am crazy about you, baby. \nHe slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught on: \nA Ford Taurus, parked, dark. \nHarry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards the parked car. \nWhen he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the curb into a U-turn and drives away. \nHarry watches the tail lights recede. \n60   INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           60 \nCLOSE ON A THUMB AND FINGER \nTwisting a gold cufflink like a worry bead. Wider shows the attorney Bogus Terikhian at a conference table in a book- lined room. \nBOGUS Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison and Zoe                        * Caldwell. It was marvelous. First                          * time I've attended the Kennedy Honors. Jane Alexander is a client. Old                            * friend of Zoe's. What an actress.                          * Anyway... \nHARRY (still chewing, he shrugs) It's no big deal. Never discharged it, twenty years service. Security blanket now. I don't think about it---- course, you're not supposed to think about it; (MORE) \nPink Revision 8/14/07 51. \nHARRY (CONT'D) in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in. Muscle memory. Reflex----Those are outrageous. \nHe stabs another dumpling off Linda's plate.                        * \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Wanna swap? \nLINDA No way! \n65   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 65 \nLinda swings the door open, leading Harry in. \nHarry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment. \nHARRY ----but there was just a hell of a lot of political infighting, petty, petty, shit, and then basically the old man stepped on Goldberger's throat. Nice... \nHe is evaluating the place.   He stamps on the floor. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Wide-plank pine? \nLINDA I guess. \nHarry is taking off his coat. \nHARRY Listen, full disclosure here Linda... \nHe holds up both hands and waggles the fingers. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but I am married. Took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to separate. Agreed to disagree. That's about the only thing we ever agreed on. \nLinda cackles. \nLINDA Thanks for telling me.     I really do appreciate it, Harry. \nHARRY Well, full transparency, the only way to---- \nAs Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.    Linda reacts to his gun in the shoulder holster: \nLINDA That's not gonna go off, is it? \nHARRY Well let's go in the other room and find out!   Grrr! \n66   INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY                                         66 \nTED TREFFON \nThe soulful manager of Hardbodies. \nTED That's great. That sounds... exciting. \nWider shows Linda in the manager's cubicle. \nLINDA He's very very communicative. Very accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries. \nTED Well, I---- \nLINDA He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor. \nTED That's good, but... but... Linda, what do you really know about this guy? \nLINDA I told you, he's in the Treasury Department and he---- \nTED But he could be one of these people who, you know, who cruises the internet---- \nLINDA Yeah, so am I! \nA rattling knock.   Linda looks over: \nChad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on the cubicle window. He gestures urgently for her to come out. \n67   EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - DAY                                         67 \nBehind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health club through a heavy back door. \nLINDA No, you can't go like that!

What is it? \nHARRY (smug) What is it. You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and... \nHe pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its entrance. \nA long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo rhythmically bobbing up and down. \nAt length: \nLINDA Omygod! \nAnother couple of cycles. \nLINDA (CONT'D) ... It's fantastic! \nHARRY Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor. And the, you know----cost of the dildo.

You're sure? \nHAL Hey, the guy was not hard to follow.

Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid old spook, but those two guys seem very interested in you. \nOsbourne looks. \nHAL (CONT'D) ...You haven't gone poofy on me, have ya Oz? \nThere are two men with drinks at a booth. At Osbourne's look one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away. \nOSBOURNE (sharply) Can I help you? \nThe man meets his look again.   He smiles, rises, ambles over. \nMAN (PROCESS SERVER) Sorry to stare, I just couldn't place the... You're Princeton, aren't you? My year?

Served... \nHe nods toward his companion, watching from the booth. \nPROCESS SERVER (CONT'D) ... and witnessed. Have a good evening. \nThe man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of his drink and rises to follow him. \nAnother car, parked on the same side of the street, further up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become visible over the driver's headrest. \nChad looks, puzzled. \n94   INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER                         94 \nChad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when a noise brings his look around: \nThe door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats. \nThey get into her car.   It pulls out. \nChad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his door but pauses, seeing: \nThe parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars disappear. \nChad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat, smoking. \nChad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden- level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the caging on the door. He looks up the fa\u00e7ade of the house. \n95   INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY                      95 \nIt pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have seen before.

COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         96 \nChad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising. A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a quick glance around. \n97    EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY                           97 \nChad vaults the wall to land in the garden. \nThe garden steps down to a back door.

COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                              102 \nChad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer. \nHe fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the computer. \n103   EXT.

He is looking idly around, heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight. \nChad freezes. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod who are you. You fucker. Omygod. \nHe gingerly crouches down. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... You fucker... \nHe tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit pockets. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod, my god... Ungh... \nHe comes away with a wallet and hastily stands. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Omygod... \nInside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards, driver's license; empty. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... What the fuck... \nHe leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason feeling obliged to return the wallet. \nAs he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside pocket he notices: \nThe suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled fringe. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Oh my fuck... \nHe straightens up again. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... I killed a fucking spook.

A silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the desktop. \nMAN Palmer.    What's up. \nPALMER Not quite certain, sir, but it's... messy. \nHe seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb. \nPalmer hands a folder across, grimacing. \nPALMER (CONT'D) ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osbourne Cox. \nGARDNER CHUBB Kolyma-2? \nPALMER Our man in the Russian Embassy. \nGARDNER CHUBB Mm. \nPALMER It was brought to them by a woman who---- \nGARDNER CHUBB The Russians? \nPALMER Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the folder. With Pfarrer's. \nGARDNER CHUBB The Russians. \nPALMER Yeah. \nGARDNER CHUBB Who's Pfarrer? \nPALMER Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other. \nGARDNER CHUBB All right.     Spare me. \nPALMER Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's gotten... complicated.

Fucker! \nHe again throws the car into reverse. \nThe man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and scrambles frantically toward the passenger side. \nHarry again smashes into the car. \nBlue Revision 8/1/07 92. \n121   EXT.

Who do you work for?! \nPounding footsteps. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Tell me! \nThe overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry closes, leaps, and tackles. \nHe crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting: \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Who do you work for? CIA?     NSC? \nThe other man is panting much harder: \nMAN Tuchman Marsh! \nThis stops Harry.   He isn't sure what he's heard. \nHARRY What? \nMAN Tuchman Marsh! \nHARRY ...

Have you found out anything about Chad? \nHARRY Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.

Back when I was in PP there was still some art to finding people. Not any more. And now with the cell phones? Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is. Everyone. At any given moment. I mean it's almost the reality now.

His chopping continues unabated. \nAfter a long look and much chopping: \nKATIE You seem distracted. \nHARRY (still chopping) Do I? \nKATIE Very distracted.      The last two days. \nHARRY Nn.   Work. \nThe chopping continues. \nKatie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry. Another beat. \nKATIE ... That's enough carrots, don't you think? \nHARRY Huh? \nKATIE For the salad? \nThe chopping stops. \nHarry slaps the knife down.   He stares at Katie, jaw grinding, for a beat. \nHARRY You know: you're really a very negative person. \nKATIE ... What? \nThrough grit teeth: \nHARRY I've tried. To ignore it.    And stay upbeat. \nKatie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned.   She returns in a manner as hard as his: \nKATIE Harry: stop the foolishness. \nHARRY Stop the foolishness? \nKATIE Yes. And behave.    You are not talking to one of your... \nHer fingers form quotes: \nKATIE (CONT'D) ... \"shithole buddies.\" \nHarry glares at her, vibrating with rage.   Her look at him is equally hard. \nHarry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs. \nBrief tromping on the second floor.   Katie sits in puzzled suspense. \nFootfalls descend the staircase. \nBlue Revision 8/1/07 90. \nHarry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge- cushion tucked under an arm. He flings the front door open, goes out, slams it shut. \n119   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE/INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                         119 * \nHarry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out his cell phone and dials. \nA ring.   Pick-up.   A female voice: \nSANDY Hello? \nHARRY Honey.    It's so good to hear your voice. \nSANDY Something wrong, Harry? \nHARRY No. Yes. Can you come home?       Your baby needs you. \nA beat. \nHARRY (CONT'D) ... Can you please come home? \nSANDY Harry, you know I---- \nHARRY I can show you your present.     It's finished. \nSANDY Oh Harry.    I can't just leave the book tour. \nHarry sags. \nHARRY Yeah. \n", "test3_id": 1388}

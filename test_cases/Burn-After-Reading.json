And what about the thigh area? \nDOCTOR Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises. \nPATIENT Uh-huh.

Now we can also do something about the vaccine scar----I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much---- \nLINDA Not with these ham hocks! \nDOCTOR Yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you---- \nLINDA Well I don't know.

He is about to open his door but pauses, seeing: \nThe parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars disappear. \nChad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other side of the street.

He rinses off, humming \"Born Free,\" and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau. \nChad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.

Suddenly: \nHARRY Hungh! \nHe plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it, dropping the knife. \nHe stands and spins, panting. \nHis point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar.

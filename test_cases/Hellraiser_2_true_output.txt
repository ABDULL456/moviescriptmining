STEVE I just called in.  How about tonight? 
KIRSTY I don't finish till twelve. 
STEVE I'm a late riser. 
He grins.  She grins. 
2ND CUSTOMER What do you have to do to get some service around here? 
STEVE Catch you later. 
68   INT.  BAR    DAY 
By contrast, a quiet bar.   Discreet music;  a well-dressed clientele.  Several couples occupy booths.  Other solitary drinkers are at the bar. 
Amongst them:   JULIA. 
Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some considerable effort to make herself ravishing.  There's nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation which shows off her considerable beauty.  She drinks soda water. 
She has an admirer.   Sitting alone at one of the tables is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous, slightly paunchy individual.  She glances over at him. His eyes don't leave her for a moment.  He's trying his best to get the courage to approach her. 
She looks away, and concentrates on her drink.  Now she takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. Her hands are trembling slightly.  She lights the cigarette, draws on it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that she's not the equal of it.  She stubs the cigarette out, puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave. 
Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side. 
PRUDHOE Not much fun, is it? 
JULIA What? 
PRUDHOE Drinking alone. 
JULIA Not much. 
PRUDHOE I wonder, maybe ... 
He's so nervous he can barely speak. 
... as we're both on our own ... we could have one drink together? 
JULIA looks at him.  He seems to almost be offering himself to her.   There's a long pause, while she tries to make up her mind. Then: 
JULIA Why not? 
She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over. 
PRUDHOE (to Julia) What are you drinking? 
JULIA Just soda. 
PRUDHOE Plain soda? 
JULIA Please. 
PRUDHOE I try not to drink at lunch- time.  Makes me sleepy in the afternoon.  You like to keep a clear head, eh? (to Barman) One soda, one whisky. (to Julia) I do it anyway.  No will-power. Got a busy afternoon? 
JULIA (looking straight at him) That depends. 
PRUDHOE Oh? 
He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly. She stares back.  Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he - scarcely believing his luck - returns. 
69   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY 
The CAMERA moves across the room. We can hear FRANK's ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its sides gleaming.  FRANK, still squatting on the floor, taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers. 
Then, voices outside:  JULIA laughs. 
He raises his head. 
70   EXT.  DOORSTEP   DAY 
JULIA opens the front door.  She is still very nervous, fumbling with the keys.  PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her. 
71   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY 
They step inside.   JULIA closes the door

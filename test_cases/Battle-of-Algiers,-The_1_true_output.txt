103	VILLA. HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY. 
In a room on the ground floor, a captain is bent over a large map with graphs, and is writing the name Sid Ahmed Sail in one of the blocks at the bottom of the pyramid ... 
At the same time, paras are seen through the large window, bringing other Algerians to the villa, and immediately afterward, the music and song are heard again very loudly. 
104	CASBAH ALLEY. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 
Night, darkness, locked doors. The Casbah is silent. The paras tread noiselessly on their rubber soles. Patrols. 
A flashlight searches for the number of a door, then stops. A para knocks discreetly. 
NOISES INSIDE. VOICES. 
ALGERIAN VOICE Who is it? 
PARA Sid Ahmed ... Sid Ahmed Sail. 
The door is opened, the paras break in. 
105	ANOTHER ALLEY. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 
Another alley in the Casbah, other paras. 
Another door forced open, broken into. 
Algerians are crowded together in a courtyard which is illuminated with electric flares. 
They are being interrogated. 
106	CASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY. RAIN. 
A cloudy day, a light drizzle, a sloping street, Algerian music. A company of zouaves walk two by two in the Casbah, through the alleys, stop, play their music, and move on again, alternating Algerian music and a French song. 
Behind them, a line of donkeys with baskets full of packages and bags, and cheerful paras who are joking, as they distribute the supplies to the starving women and children, who stand ashamed in front of their houses, their eyes lowered, their gestures too brusque, and hesitant. 
SPEAKER "At the General Assembly of the United Nations, none of the motions presented in the course of the debate has obtained the necessary majority. At last an agreement has been reached on a resolution that excludes any form of direct intervention by the UN in the Algerian question. The Assembly of the United Nations has limited itself to expressing the hope that in a spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, democratic, and just solution will be found, that conforms to the principles of the United Nations Charter ..." 
The monotony of the last words is drowned out and lost. It is raining more heavily now. The water has begun to run along the sloping alleys. The walls are gray, wet; the doors of the cafes and shops are barred with signs nailed upon them. 
THIS SHOP HAS SUPPORTED THE NLF STRIKE. THE PREFECT HAS ORDERED ITS CLOSING UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 
The band of zouaves has stopped again, and now they are playing "La vie en rose." 
107	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAWN. 
In some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing "La vie en rose." 
In the room on the first floor, through the large window, the whiteness of the dawn is visible. The desk is cluttered with beer cans and thermos. Mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph, where the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the pyramid. The scene is motionless; their expressions are dull. Everyone seems to be incapable of movement, overcome by the dull apathy that always follows a sleepless night. 
Until Mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene. 
MATHIEU Good ... Good work ... Now we can all go to sleep. 
And moving together with the others, he continues. 
MATHIEU The end of the strike doesn't change anything. The directives remain the same. Give your men the usual shifts. We must remain in the Casbah: twenty-four hours a day! 
He turns and points to the graph.

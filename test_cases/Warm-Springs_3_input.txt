JAKE PERRINI, 32, Bronx-born with an upper body of steel wheels over to Roy who is fixing a wheelchair. 
JAKE Jake Perrini, Bronx, New York. 
ROY Roy, sir. 
JAKE How you doin'? 
Jake reaches out his hand to shake. Roy is unsure what to do. 
JAKE C'mon -- I won't bite. 
T 
ROY (shaking his hand) Mighty fine, sir. Mighty fine. 
JAKE Hey, would you mind pulling me outta this trap, Roy? I wanna get airborne. 
Roy gently lifts Jake up and out of his chair, into his arms like a child. 
JAKE Do me one more favor? Throw me in? 
Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before SPLASHING down hard in the water. H e bobs up to the surface. There is applause. 
FRANKLIN Now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me. 
Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for everyone. 
FRANKLIN My hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water I'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage. 
He swims to the edge of the pool. 
FRANKLIN So everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can! 
hey disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them. 
FRANKLIN Go ahead now, do your best! 
Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred, Franklin leads them on, spiritedly. 
In the distance we see Tom, leaning against a tree, watching everything.

INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT Segregated in a back room, all the polio guests are gathered for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables. 
Roy carries DAISY in and places her in the chair next to Franklin. 
RANKLIN Do you have a reservation? 
She begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the situation. 
FRANKLIN Whether in here or our there, I guarantee you the food will taste the same... terrible. 
DAISY Shouldn't we pray first? 
FRANKLIN By all means. Would you do us the honor? 
Franklin bows his head for grace. 
DAISY Bless the food on our table. Keep us healthy, strong and able. Amen. 
ALL Amen.

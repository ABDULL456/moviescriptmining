Prisoners silently gather at the gunline. Jangle Leg pushes his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without hesitation. Dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their fire. They train their rifles on Jangle Leg as he strides toward his fallen companion. Jangle Leg gently lifts Biscuit's lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him back toward the camp. The CAMERA RISES HIGH OVERHEAD as the prisoners make way for Jangle Leg to cross back over the gunline. 
INT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY 
A dark mood hangs over the men. Jangle Leg sits stoically as Radio fiddles with his receiver. Nearby, Poker Face and Ray play a listless game of gin rummy. Claude is thumbing distractedly through a dog-eared copy of Baseball Digest. 
RADIO Hey, fellas, I got Chicago. 
But nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news. Radio shrugs and drops down on his bunk. 
Just then, Can't Get Right walks past heading for the door. He's dressed in civilian clothes, his bindle slung over his shoulder. 
CLAUDE Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going? Why you dressed like that? 
Can't Get Right holds out a piece of paper which Ray scrutinizes. 
RAY It's a pardon from the governor. 
CLAUDE Let me see that. 
The incorrigibles gather around for a glimpse at Can't Get Right's ticket to freedom. 
CLAUDE Where'd you get this? 
Can't Get Right nods out the window. Stan Blocker is waiting by his car. 
EXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY 
Claude storms across the yard and stops at the gun line. Ray is a few steps behind. 
CLAUDE Yo, Blocker, what's going on here? 
BLOCKER Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon. 
CLAUDE Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us. 
BLOCKER I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do? 
This hits Claude hard. 
RAY Let it go, Claude. 
CLAUDE I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises. 
BLOCKER Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you... 
CLAUDE But you can't. 
BLOCKER At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted? 
Claude looks around as the incorrigibles begin to gather. He's on the spot. Dillard approaches with Can't Get Right. Claude looks into the big kid's eyes. 
CLAUDE (resigned) Yeah. Of course it is. 
Steeling himself to the reality of the situation, Claude gives Can't Get Right a hug. 
CLAUDE You show them Crawfords how to play ball. 
RAY Make 'em throw strikes. 
Can't Get Right nods. He steps up to the gun line and looks at both shooter shacks. 
DILLARD It's alright. You're a free man now. 
Can't Get Right steps across the gun line. Blocker opens the car door for him. But before he climbs in, Can't Get Right reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. With a smile, he tosses it to Claude, who snatches it out of the air. 
BLOCKER Don't worry, we'll take good care of him. 
Blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel. Claude and Ray watch Blocker's car drive off under a red Mississippi sunset. Slowly, the inmates drift back toward the bunkhouse until Ray an Claude are left alone at the gun line. 
RAY One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place. 
CLAUDE I'm not in the mood right now, Ray. 
RAY He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it. 
CLAUDE They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now. 
RAY I don't see you coming up with any plans. 
CLAUDE (getting mad) My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now? 
RAY Crop duster. 
CLAUDE I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.

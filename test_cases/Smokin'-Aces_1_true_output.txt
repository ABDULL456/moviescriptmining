DUPREE So I guess you're not going. 
ELMORE Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler...I like your chances a lot more. 
Dupree, stubbing his cigarette. 
DUPREE I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped. 
ELMORE That's already happened hoss.   It's naive to think otherwise. 
DEEKS Where is he? 
WYMAN (V.O.) --Lake Tahoe. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. DINER -- NIGHT 
Watters, nodding, wiping red sauce off her fingers. 
WATTERS Three hours t'the east. S'day trip. Pretty this time a'year too... 
Sykes sets her fork down, wipes her hands on a napkin. 
SYKES We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass. 
WATTERS What are we talkin' on the split... 
WYMAN Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me. 
SYKES What's the time frame? 
WYMAN Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool. 
MESSNER (V.O.) ...Then we lose our witness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY 
The briefing continues. 
LOCKE We lose our case. Twenty-four hours from now, he's scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors. His agent, a man by the name of Morris Mecklen, has guaranteed us that he'll enter into protective custody once his deal is approved. 
CUT TO: 
MORRIS MECKLEN, 60's, bloated, bad combover, agent to the Vegas vanguard. He sits at his desk, jawing into the phone. On the wall, framed photos; Wayne Newton, Buddy Hackett, Carol Channing and a triple-chinned, near-the-end Elvis. 
LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D) We've been monitoring Mecklen's calls and have learned that Israel is staying in the penthouse level of the Nomad Hotel and Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada under an assumed name. 
CUT BACK TO SCENE: 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
CARRUTHERS Right there? In the high-roller suite? 
MESSNER It's the last place they'd look. 
LOCKE Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas...that can't happen. (beat) We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe. (pause, with weight) It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano-- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel. 
SMASH CUT TO BLACK: 
MONTAGE 
Over this entire sequence WE HEAR Agent Locke speaking: 
The cylinder of a .44 Magnum is popped, a speed-load dropped in, spun and snapped shut-- Porn mags and crossword puzzle compendiums are tossed into a carry-on. Morphine and adrenaline syringes get spiked and capped-- A collection of wigs, fake sideburns and moustaches get laid out, separated-- 
LOCKE (CONT'D) ...But understand that if an attempt is made on his life... 
Kevlar body armor gets stowed-- An elephant gun gets buffed to a high shine-- Vintage Ww11 German Potato-Masher hand- grenades are lovingly wrapped in terry cloth towels. 
LOCKE (CONT'D) ...then it is being made by those of the strictest professional caliber... 
Torture-tools; curved cutting implements, serrated bone saws, skull keys, a portable blowtorch, blackened with burned blood...all packed neatly into a duffel bag-- 
LOCKE (CONT'D) ...They are cold-blooded, ruthless, and without restraint...and they must not succeed. 
A gun is aimed, a trigger pulled..."BOOM" 
SMASH CUT TO BLACK 
FADE UP ON: 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING 
Daybreak. Sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of good scotch. PRIMO SPARAZZA, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an O2 mask shrouding deep-set, sunken eyes, cataract-grey, gazing out at a four-walled world. Someone enters the room, awaiting approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man, summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches him, kneeling down, ring-kissing reverent, whispering:

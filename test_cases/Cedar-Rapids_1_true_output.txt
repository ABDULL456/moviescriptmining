Something dawns on Tim-- who gives a shit. He glances at Joan and her skirt and her exposed knee. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery. 
Tim pulls into a spot in the Westdale Mall parking lot. He gestures for Joan to wait a second. 
JOAN I'll just meet you inside. 
TIM OK. Sounds good. (TO MILLIE) Sorry Mil, go ahead. 
INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Millie looks wounded. 
MILLIE So who's this Joan? 
EXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS 
Tim gets out of the car. 
TIM Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) You promised you'd check in with me. I'm very disappointed. 
TIM (PLAYFUL) OK, Mom... 
Silence. It's as though a profound revelation has just slipped out. As if, in an instant, everything has changed. 
INT. MILLIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Millie's heart sinks. She looks at her Beanie Babies. 
MILLIE Well. You obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. My brother and I were just getting ready to go for fish at the Eagles anyhow. 
Reveal: Wade is sitting in his rightful throne, watching an aerobics show on TV. Millie snaps at him. 
MILLIE (CONT'D) Go warm up the car, Wade. 
TIM (O.S. ON PHONE) Mil, I didn't... 
MILLIE It's fine. You'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, Tim. Good Night. 
Millie hangs up. Wade gives her a supportive shrug. 
EXT. WESTDALE MALL - CONTINUOUS 
Tim snaps his phone shut. What just happened? He considers his options for a moment. 
INT. WESTDALE MALL - MOMENTS LATER 
Joan window shops at a LensCrafters. Tim approaches her. 
TIM Hey. What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? At the mall. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Joan smiles at him, and we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. OLIVE GARDEN - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Tim approaches the Olive Garden MAÎTRE D'. 
TIM We have a gift card. But I didn't make a reservation. Is that OK? 
Save for three tables of ELDERLY PEOPLE, the place is empty. 
MAÎTRE D' Right this way, sir. 
Tim raises his eyebrows to Joan-- not too shabby. 
INT. OLIVE GARDEN, ROMANTIC BOOTH - A LITTLE WHILE LATER 
Tim and Joan are seated in a candlelit booth. Opera Muzak tinkles. If you didn't know this to be a mall-based chain, you might think it a romantic Italian restaurant. Maybe. 
An acne-scarred WAITER, 21, approaches with a tray. 
WAITER Coors Lite for the madam. A cream sherry for monsieur. And here are some bottomless bread sticks.

The Rock Ledge of Sietch Tabr is filled with Fedaykin and monks; Chani, Jessica, Gurney and Stilgar stand together near the back.  Paul moves out on the Rock Ledge overlooking the Hall of Rites which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS. 
Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ continues with a soft low NOTE.  The Fremen wait. 
PAUL Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet. 
A quiet, haunting MOAN of recognition of a master rises from the Fremen. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (loud) Your time has come. (inner voice) Father... our time has come. (out loud again) A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you. 
A thunderous ROAR arises.  War DRUMS pound.  The ORGAN blows hurricaine of power through the sietch. 
PAUL (he raises crysknife) Long live the fighters! 
STILGAR Long live the fighters! 
Fremen carrying weapons begin moving out in long lines from the Hall as the war DRUMS pound.

PAUL Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics.  I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have wormsign? 
Stilgar and Gurney laugh. 
STILGAR Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of which even God has never seen. 
Paul smiles. 
261. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY 
Looking down over the huge desert it looks like a living sea of wormsign.  Everywhere ripples appear and worms are surfacing. 261A.     EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY 
Thousands of Fremen are running, positioning themselves to mount and ride. 
262. EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Dust clouds grow faster and the speed of the WIND increases.  Sand particles hit at a rock outcropping and up close they sound like giant warrior drummers pounding before battle.

Suddenly above come hundreds of SCREAMING space ships zooming down across the desert floor and towards the landing field.

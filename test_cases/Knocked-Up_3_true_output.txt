BEN Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You can't smoke crack. And you can't jump on trampolines. This is basically a giant list of things you can't do. 
ALISON It sounds thrilling. 
BEN I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack. And you're not gonna have anything to do. You're gonna be bored. But I can't wait to read these, honestly. I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning. Do you want me to get you that? 
ALISON Yeah, thank you. 
BEN No problem. These are heavy.

DEBBIE Shut up.

INT. ALLISON'S GUEST HOUSE 
Alison and Ben stand while kissing. 
BEN At least we don't have to use a condom, you know? Alison pulls away. BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd) But we can. I brought some just in case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I mean, I don't, I thought-- 
ALISON It's not that. 
BEN It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know? 
ALISON Okay, first of all, it's not my situation. It's our situation. 
BEN I know that. 
ALISON And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door. 
BEN I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's all this is. 
ALISON I like you, too. 
KNOCKED UP - 54. 
BEN Sweet. 
ALISON A little, so far. I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes. We don't have to rush it. 
BEN Yeah. 
ALISON We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot. You know? We got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to. 
BEN For the baby, right? 
ALISON Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do? 
BEN B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so... 
ALISON You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that? 
BEN I can do that. I'm really nervous. 
ALISON I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous. 
BEN Yeah. Ben and Alison kiss. 
ALISON You're a sweet guy, right? 
BEN I think I am. 
ALISON Don't fuck me over, okay? 
BEN I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay? 
ALISON Okay. 
BEN I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone. 
KNOCKED UP - 55. 
Ben and Alison kiss.

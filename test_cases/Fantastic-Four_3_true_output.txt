Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately. 
BEN Yeah, I have that effect on people. 
The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. The Technicians are gone now. 
REED Ben -- 
BEN Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body? 
REED We're working as hard as we can -- 
BEN Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right. 
He motions to Reed and Sue together. 
REED Come on, this is nothing. 
Sue looks a little hurt. 
BEN Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work. 
REED Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe-- 
He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard. 
BEN Look at me, Reed.  Look at me! 
He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground. 
REED I am looking.  That's why I can't make a mistake!  I've got to get it right, and it's not right yet!  We need to test this. 
Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed. 
BEN I spent my whole life protecting you, from the schoolyard to the stars.  For what?  So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while I'm the freak of the week? 
Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams into the wall, and stays down this time. 
SUE Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it. 
She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields. 
BEN Stay out of this Susie. 
As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated. 
BEN (CONT'D) Good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back.  'Cause you're on your own now. 
Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding. 
REED I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop him. 
She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in -- 
INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown. And he grabs his UNIFORM... 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets there too late.  Doors close, going down. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in. 
JOHNNY Christmas come early!  Check it out! 
He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and -- 
BEN ACTION FIGURE IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME! 
WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster. 
JOHNNY Hey!  That's a prototype! 
BEN Go back to the drawing board. 
He strides away. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 
DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter. 
SUE Johnny?  Did you see Ben? 
JOHNNY Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world. 
SUE Is that what you call it?  "Real"? 
JOHNNY At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project. 
This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

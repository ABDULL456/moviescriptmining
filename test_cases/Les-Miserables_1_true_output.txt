FACTORY WOMAN 5 Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands! 
FACTORY WOMAN 2 And the boss, he never knows That the foreman is always on heat. 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN If Fantine doesn't look out, Watch how she goes, She'll be out on the street! 
The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day. 
The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. 
FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN At the end of the day its another day over With enough in your pocket to last for a week Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep on working as long as you're able Keep on working till you drop Or it's back to the crumbs off the table Well, you've got to pay your way At the end of the day! 
The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door. 
Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman snatches the letter away from Fantine. 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN And what have we here, little innocent sister? 
The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers. 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news. (reading) `Dear Fantine, you must send us more money, Your child needs a doctor, There's no time to lose.' 
FANTINE Give that letter to me It is none of your business. With a husband at home And a bit on the side! Is there anyone here Who can swear before God She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide? 
The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over to the Foreman. 
Fantine tries to get the letter back. The women scuffle. 
The owner enters the factory floor. We see him only from behind: a well-dressed prosperous man. 
VALJEAN What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus. 
As he sings, the CAMERA MOVES ROUND to discover him. Clean- shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean. 
VALJEAN Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute. 
Suddenly Valjean sees Javert appear on the first floor balcony of his office. His world drops away. 
VALJEAN (to the foreman) Deal with this, Foreman. Be as patient as you can. 
He walks back to the stairs up to his office. 
On the factory floor - 
FOREMAN Now someone say how this began! 
The factory women all turn on Fantine. 
FANTINE/FACTORY WOMAN 5 At the end of the day she's the one who began it! 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town. 
FACTORY WOMAN 5 There's a man she has to pay 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN You can guess how she picks up the extra - You can bet she's earning her keep Sleeping around! And the boss wouldn't like it. 
FANTINE Yes, it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter And her father abandoned us, Leaving us flat. Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife And I pay for the child. What's the matter with that? 
Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the women sing - 
FACTORY WOMEN At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one! While we're earning our daily bread She's the one with her hands in the butter - You must send the slut away Or we're all going to end in the gutter And it's us who'll have to pay At the end of the day! 
The Foreman pulls Fantine away. 
FOREMAN I might have known the bitch could bite! I might have known the cat had claws! I might have guessed your little secret! Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine Who keeps herself so pure and clean - You'd be the cause, I had no doubt Of any trouble hereabout. You play a virgin in the light But need no urging in the night! 
MAIN FACTORY WOMAN She's been laughing at you While she's having her men! 
FACTORY WOMEN She'll be nothing but trouble again and again! 
FACTORY WOMAN 5 You must sack her today! 
FACTORY WOMEN Sack the girl today! 
FOREMAN Right, my girl! On your way! 
Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry. 
FANTINE M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a child! 
Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns round to face Javert.

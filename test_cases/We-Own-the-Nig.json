{"test1_input": "VADIM NEZHINSKI Yeah... Smart smart stupid. Got his head buried in books all day, `stead of the real world... \nAD-LIB amusement from the \"yes\" men.   Vadim moves closer: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) Listen uh, I come to you, I tell you I got some friends bringin' a load in here, maybe something big-- I'm just talking now--they bring it in, how do you feel about that? \nBOBBY GREEN Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Well, upstairs don't gotta know everything, am I right? Place gets packed every night, everybody wins. \nBobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who shout out hellos. Vadim shakes Bobby's shoulder with affection. Intimate: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) You know, you should think about comin' in with us. You're popular-- you could help us...expand a little. A lotta money in it. \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah...I'll think about that. Rosario--I wanna talk to you. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Go ahead.   We'll talk. \nBobby takes Rosario by the arm away from the table. \nTHE BAR \nAs Bobby moves with Rosario to the bar: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROSARIO DIAZ It go good upstairs, baby? \nBOBBY GREEN You gotta stop dealing. You hear what I'm telling you? \nThese words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by her own behavior because she stares at her shoes, momentarily speechless. He grabs her: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You hear what I said? \nROSARIO DIAZ Yeah, I heard. But I need the money right now, Bobby. And I'm not gonna rely on you for EVERYTHING-- \nBobby purses his lips, frustrated.     Then: \nBOBBY GREEN Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons. \nMomentarily confused, she mutters a \"'kay,\" then kisses him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face. \nROSARIO DIAZ I love you... \nBOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN...       All of a SUDDEN: BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS. \nThe DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD, like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs around his neck. WITH COMMAND: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Everybody! Get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move! (to a woman) Turn off that music. Right now! \nFOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to    the COAT CHECK AREA. ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start    falling to the FLOOR. The patrons are desperate to get rid    of any incriminating evidence, and BOTH MEN AND WOMEN RUN    TO THE BATHROOMS. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM \nSeveral patrons start DUMPING NARCOTICS INTO THE TOILET BOWLS when MANY COPS ENTER and, with ferocity, hit them with batons to corral them. The TOILETS are backing up... \nINT. WOMEN'S ROOM \nSome girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS BURST INTO FLAMES. \nCOPS Holy shit! Get the extinguishers-- call paramedics! \nINT. MAIN ROOM \nThe cops pin EVERYONE up against the wall or on the ground. EVERYONE IS LINED UP, SEARCHED. I.D.s are checked. Bobby turns to Rosario: \nBOBBY GREEN Gimme your shit! \nTroubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP approaches Bobby: \nUNIFORMED COP Hey! I saw that! Get your hands on your fuckin' head! \nBobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; Rosario is tossed aside. The Uniformed Cop, to someone else: \nUNIFORMED COP (CONT'D) Jessie!   This one just ingested! \nAll patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads. PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal: \nPARAMEDIC Arright, open up--a little charcoal, to absorb the toxin... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAs Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Give everybody a toss. G.Q.-- \nThis gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to LOUIS, pokes his gut: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Too much pizza, right there. \nSeveral COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart. (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Turn around...    Turn around! \nVadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) What is this? (BEAT) Want me to double your money? Huh? \n", "test1_true": "JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Okay.   It's doubled now, how's that. \nMichael and Jack search the other members of Vadim's party. They rip out pockets. Michael points to a WOMAN'S FUR: \nMICHAEL SOLO You got anything in there? \nHe motions for the MINK. She hands it over.       HE PATS IT DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING. \nACROSS THE ROOM \nThe Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others. Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next to Bobby. Unwittingly referring to Bobby's brother: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLOUIS FALSETTI Jesus, that cop's crazy! \nUNIFORMED COP Hey! Fat Albert! Shut your fuckin' mouth! \nSEVERAL OFFICERS charge through now, PULLING THE LATINO MAN AND THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN (in cuffs) from behind the coat check. Bobby is pulled up, on his feet. \nBACK TO \nJoseph interrogating Vadim.   As he looks through I.D.: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (SUBTITLE) You got a cross AND a Jewish star on you? \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE) The cross is for good luck. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY What's the star for? \nVADIM NEZHINSKI That one's for God. \nJust then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects.   In Joseph's ear: \nMICHAEL SOLO Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a little PCP. \nJoseph nods, acknowledging this news.    He EYES Vadim, then turns to the TWO MEN: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Okay, let's go. You. And you-- (to the Young Man) You're under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics-- \nMichael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them. \nPARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM.   Girls are on STRETCHERS. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nA HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM. Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Your boy's gonna turn. And then we'll come back for you. \nJOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed... \nINT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HOLDING CELLS \nThe station: 1980's-era, very unlike ones seen on T.V. The walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs. Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies. A big sign above a bulletin board reads, \"WE OWN THE NIGHT.\" Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse. There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE. \nPORTLY COP Jesus Christ, what the hell's goin' on in here? \nThe Young Dark-Skinned Man is right outside the cell, his body in spasm, covered with blood coursing from his neck. Cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams. \nUNIFORMED COP Russian guy fuckin' slashed himself! \nAfter seeing this, Bobby is shoved in his cell, his nose still leaking the charcoal, blood all over his shoes. After a beat, he lies down on the cot... \nEXT. STATION - DAWN \nBobby exits, walks toward the nearby SUBWAY STATION.   SPOTS BURT, who's waiting for him. Bobby ignores him: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Where you going? I was the one who got you outta there! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN Thanks a lot.    I appreciate it. \nBURT GRUSINSKY You're a real big shot, aren't you! You see what happened in there last night? Hey--I'm talking to you! \nBurt grabs his son's arm.      Moves closer: \nBURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) You know, you and your girlfriend're only getting off `cause of your brother. Up to me, you'd sit in there another couple days. \nBobby looks around. Nobody's listening. He opens up. With quiet but real fury, and total sarcasm: \nBOBBY GREEN Okay, I'll go thank him too then. He comes in, raids the fuckin' place--now I gotta go beg `em not to fire me-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY Fire you?! From what? Probably the best thing that ever happened to you! \nBOBBY GREEN Fuck you, Pop.    Fuck the both of you's. \nEnraged, Burt SLAPS his SON on the side of the head: \n", "test1_id": 2067, "test2_input": "Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain him delicately (\"C'mon, calm down\"), but Bobby is in no mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything else, and it is messy, tough: \nBOBBY GREEN DON'T--FUCKIN'-- \nBobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in a rage. Then, sarcastic: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Go `head!   Keep me in here--KEEP ME HERE! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARD'S VOICE (MUFFLED) Bobby, we don't wanna have to put you in restraints, so just calm down! (BEAT) Calm the fuck down! \nBobby stares at the door. \nBOBBY GREEN You gonna keep me here? HUH?!? \nStill in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to: \nINT. BEDROOM \nWhere he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck. BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs. \nIt is as though all of the emotions in our story find their outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining feeling drain from him until he has nothing left. \nAfter this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head... \nWe PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING: \nINT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH \nA noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door. Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then: \nA MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER) Hello? \nA BEAT.   Bobby collects himself.    Then: \nBOBBY GREEN It's me, Lou. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) HEY!!!!   Bobkes!!! How you doin'?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN I'm okay. Listen uh, you ain't spoke to Rosario lately, have you? \nLOUIS FALSETTI No. She's holed up with you, ain't she?--God knows where. \nBOBBY   GREEN Yeah--it's just, she   must've gone out for a little bit   and...I wanted to get in touch with   her. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Well, I talk to her, I'll tell her you called. \nBOBBY GREEN Thanks... You know, things are really changing on my end. I ain't gonna be in protection anymore. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) Oh Bob! That's great! Whaddaya say we knock back a few in your Dad's memory tonight? \nBOBBY GREEN ...I, I don't know... \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) Come on! El Caribe's got their masquerade party--every third drink's free. Be like old times! (BEAT) I'll be there--what more could ask for! C'mon! You comin'? Huh? (BEAT) You gonna be a man or not? \nANGLE on BOBBY as we GO TO: \nINT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nA SHOW is about to go on. The place has a darker quality to it now, and many patrons are wearing HALLOWEEN MASKS. BOBBY ENTERS, approaches a table in the back, where seated are Louis and Louis' girlfriend, HAZEL. Lou is armed with a huge grin, and he stands and hugs Bobby: \nLOUIS FALSETTI My brother!   The Grand Return! \nAs they sit, Lou notices Bobby is alone: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) You ain't heard from Rosario yet? \nBOBBY GREEN No... \nLOUIS FALSETTI (moves closer) You want Hazel here to fix you up with a little something? I'm only kiddin'--let's have a drink-- (to a waitress) Hey Natasha, over there! \nHAZEL Why don't you slow down a little? You're already acting stupid! \nLOUIS FALSETTI And you're already acting like a pain in my ass! I can hold my liquor and yours! \nBOBBY GREEN Jumbo, I don't want nothing right now--don't worry about it. \nJUST THEN, THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM.    A SPOTLIGHT on the STAGE. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV ambles up to the microphone with some difficulty. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Good evening. My name is Marat Buzhayev, and I'm the owner of the El Caribe. We have a special night, tonight--the Odessa Dance Troop is here to perform for us. I know you'll enjoy it. \nAPPLAUSE.    Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) We also have an old friend who's come back to us--I want him to stand--Bobby? Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to be our manager here... \nMORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits. The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his introduction (\"Enjoy the show! \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_true": "Thank you.\") and exits to still more applause. ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby. In his EAR: \nELI MIRICHENKO My father-in-law would love it if you come upstairs later, to say hello. \nBOBBY GREEN Okay, Eli.   Tell him I'll come up. \nEli nods, exits.   Beat.   Then, sensing Bobby's mood: \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bob, you all right? \nBOBBY GREEN (hesitates; then) Rosario--Rosario's gone down to Florida for a little while. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Florida? (BEAT) Well, she probably just needed a little time for herself. She'll be back. \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah... (more interior) You know, I was just thinking `bout when I first met her here... Working back there... \nLOUIS FALSETTI Ah, don't worry, Bob. I have no doubt she'll be back. \nLouis turns to watch the show for a beat, takes a huge swig of his DRINK. Then turns AROUND AGAIN; close to Bobby: \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) I mean, between you and me, that place they had you in was drivin' her crazy. The Kew Motor Inn--we used to call that the SCREW Motor Inn, with all the hookers... (back to Hazel) Get that waitress wouldja? \nLouis turns back to the show. The camera moves into a CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as Louis' words FREEZE him. He seems ready to EXPLODE. Then, finally: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBOBBY GREEN Louis--? (Lou turns to him) How'd you know where I was staying? \nLOUIS FALSETTI Huh? \nBOBBY GREEN How'd you know where I was staying? \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CAUGHT) It was, it was in the papers... \nBobby gets up with astonishing speed and moves right next to Louis. He grabs his arm tightly and, in his ear: \nBOBBY GREEN It wasn't in no papers, Louis. Don't make me embarrass you. Let's go outside, right now. \nThe camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on LOUIS as he FRETS... \nEXT. BACK ALLEY \nStill grabbing Louis's arm, Bobby wrenches him loose. Louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt. Bobby steps FORWARD. Something is different about him now. He is colder than ice, his eyes black saucers of rage. \nBOBBY GREEN Where's Nezhinski? \nLOUIS FALSETTI I don't know-- \nBOBBY GREEN Don't play games with me, Louis. \nLOUIS FALSETTI But I don't kn-- \nBOBBY GREEN I just said, DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH ME! (BEAT) Rosario tol' you where we were staying, didn't she?!? She trusted you... \nLouis begins to crack.   Tears come to his eyes... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bob, we're, we're buddies--we're like brothers! C'mon! \nBOBBY GREEN You don't mean nothing to me now-- that part of my life is dead. (beat; for himself) Today it ended for good... \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bobby I swear--I don't know nothing! \nBOBBY GREEN You know my father is dead because of you? \nLouis begins to sob quietly, shivering. He brings his hand to his mouth. Bobby takes a threatening step forward: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You know I'm on the Force now? And I could do anything to you? \nLouis' eyes widen.    He holds out his hands defensively. \nLOUIS FALSETTI No, wait! Bob, please! (beat; weakening) Don't do this to me... (even softer) Don't do this to me Bob, please... \nBOBBY GREEN You tell me what you know right now or I swear to Christ I will make you disappear. \nLouis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old. He falls to his knees. Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet: \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bobby, I... I told `em where you were--but, but it ain't what you think! I was makin' a buy and these guys in hoods, they held a gun to my head--so I tried to give `em the wrong information! \nBobby clenches his fist.    Louis grabs onto him again: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) No, wait, listen! It's true! Rosario tol' me you moved every couple days, she said you was gonna move--I thought you'd be gone by then! It's the truth, Bobby! I would never try and hurt you! Never, swear to God! \nBobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit. He tries to calm himself but cannot. With a ferocity, he unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt of his fist. Louis collapses. In Louis' ear: \nBOBBY GREEN You tell me, right now-- (BEAT) Where's your fuckin' spot?!? \nCUT TO: \nTHE CAMERA DOLLIES past A SHOOTING GALLERY. ADDICTS, their inert bodies both crumpled and standing in virtual trances, wander an ALLEYWAY. They RECOIL from CAR HEADLIGHTS: \n", "test2_id": 2068, "test3_input": "EXT.

DARK AND DIRTY HALLWAY - ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING \nA young AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE stands in a doorway, dressed in a green parka. The hall, covered with trash and graffiti, is illuminated by a solitary light bulb. He guards ANOTHER SHOOTING GALLERY, which is in the room right behind him. \nFOOTSTEPS. The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE is on guard. The MAN emerges from the darkness, his back STILL TO US. Upon seeing him, the African-American Man smiles, reaches into his pocket. Hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope: \nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN I got your money man, but my shit's running low. When you get me more? \nMAN'S VOICE (SLIGHT ACCENT) (as he counts the $) Just hold on a little while longer-- we get more for you soon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN Yeah?   When's that gonna be? \nMAN'S VOICE Tomorrow. \nWe CUT TO the over-the-shoulder of the man, and leaning out of the DARKNESS and into the LIGHT: ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law. He continues: \nELI MIRICHENKO After tomorrow, everybody's gonna get well. \nThe African-American Man nods. Satisfied with the cash, Eli turns around, walks back down the hallway. ANGLE BACK ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN as the camera zooms past him, into: \nINT. SHOOTING GALLERY \nIn the darkness, among the addicts: BOBBY GREEN. His face illuminated only by the sliver of light from the crack in the door. He's witnessed the whole thing... We HEAR: \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) We got your boy Eli completely covered, Bobby. \nINT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe group is all together. Cops we don't know pack the room, standing around the table. Seated at the table: Michael, Jack, Bobby, and at the head, Joseph. A TOUGH- LOOKING COP we've seen before but not met: \nTOUGH-LOOKING COP He just turned in for the night. (BEAT) Can't move an inch without us up his ass. \nBOBBY GREEN Well, he said tomorrow and that's what matters. \nTOUGH-LOOKING COP And we'll be right there with him-- you can be sure of that. \nMICHAEL SOLO They're movin' serious weight, we might be talkin' major league firepower. Maybe we call in the Feds.

Bobby turns to Joseph: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Pop would never bring `em in, Joe. We gotta see this through ourselves... \nJACK SHAPIRO Bobby's right. \nJoseph's back stiffens.       With resolve: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah, definitely... We'll get the TAC plan together... (INTENSE) And wherever it is, we'll be ready for `em... \nMICHAEL SOLO Arright, guys.    That's it for now. \nThe troops get up to leave.      Jack approaches Joseph. SOTTO: \nJACK SHAPIRO JOE-- \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah? \nBobby looks at Jack--who leans in, to Joseph's ear: \nJACK SHAPIRO You know, they're laughin' at us, out there on the street. Now when we get there, it'll be up to you what we do. But I hope you think about droppin' the hammer on `em. \nJoseph contemplates this briefly, then Jack pulls him CLOSER: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJACK SHAPIRO (CONT'D) I mean--after your father and everything? These people're like fuckin' lice. (BEAT) Just think about what I'm saying to you. \nBobby senses the pressure being placed upon his brother, and he moves Jack away from Joseph: \nBOBBY GREEN All right, c'mon. Enough... \nANGLE ON BOBBY, JOSEPH as we GO TO: \nEXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD - LATE NIGHT/DAWN \nSERIES OF SHOTS of: \n1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed growth that is extremely dense. \n2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom, probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned. \n3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL WEEDS AROUND IT. \n4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving. Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET: \n", "test3_true": "Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases-- presumably filled with money. \nTHEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR.    And yet ANOTHER. \nThe men all congregate like it's a legal business transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES. \nWe PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE: Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS. One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby grabs his brother's arm, squeezes: \nBOBBY GREEN We're gonna get all of `em today. \nJUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out. They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the shack... \nALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this? ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto. Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's the EMPEROR... \nEMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli, helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other. They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the devastation. Almost to himself: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Lookit the two of them...they're so fuckin' close... \nThen the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless. \nSTANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN. \nBUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand. \nMICHAEL SOLO Okay--when they complete the sale, that's when we move. ESU'll grab the kids. \nA TRANSACTION BEGINS inside the shack, and the COPS are WATCHING. They SEE the action through BROKEN WINDOWS... \nINT. SHACK \nNEZHINSKI and MARAT, with the Businessmen.

It's my own method. \nThe Man places a FUR on a distressed countertop.    Rips it apart. Nezhinski steps forward: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE) The rest of the product is in the van--total weight, 75 kilos. \nPlaces one of the lengths of fur into: A BASIN filled with fluid... The CAMERA ZOOMS into A CLOSE SHOT on the FUR in that basin... \nThe FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the surface. \nDUMPING OUT   some of the substance (now in crystalline form) onto a pad,   MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who TASTES it.    THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his product...    He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED. Filled with   MONEY. \nEXT. FIELD \nBobby and Joseph.    Joseph has his earpiece, HEARS.

A GROUP OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who watch this with fear and incomprehension... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE. \nALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp. \nCLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING...

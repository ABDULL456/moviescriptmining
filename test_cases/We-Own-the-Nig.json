{"train": "We MOVE past partygoers. THEN, APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS: Bobby and Rosario--who's being eyed up and down salaciously by the men in the party. The two start to come down the narrow stairs leading to the basement. A portly, ebullient man, RUSSELL DE KEIFER: \nRUSSELL DE KEIFER Bobby? Bobby Grusinsky, that you? How you doin'?! (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: RUSSELL DE KEIFER (CONT'D) It's me, Russell De Keifer, from across Northern Boulevard, remember? You still bartending that Russian joint, out there in Brooklyn? \nBOBBY GREEN Nah.   Nah, I'm managing now. \nRUSSELL DE KEIFER Oh, big shot! \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright? \nBobby slinks past De Keifer.     Rosario touches his arm: \nROSARIO DIAZ What'd he call you? \nBOBBY GREEN (slightly sheepish) I changed my name--I use my mother's name now. It's better for business. C'mon... \nINT. BASEMENT \nA wiry YOUNG POLICE REPORTER, in uniform, moves to Joseph. Burt stands nearby, proud: \nYOUNG POLICE REPORTER Captain Grusinsky, hi! I'm Officer Timpanaro from SPRING 3100, the police magazine-- \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY How you doing... \nThe Reporter reads his question off a small pad.      (VERY important that he come off like an amateur.) \nYOUNG POLICE REPORTER So: um, you are now the third-- \nSomeone hits his arm.     He drops his pad, picks it up. \nYOUNG POLICE REPORTER (CONT'D) The third youngest captain on the Force, and our P.B.A. readers'll wanna know just how that, um-- (looks at his pad) --Feels! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels good! I love trying to, you know, help make the City safer for people and everything... \nACROSS THE ROOM: \nBobby and Rosario come down the stairs. Bobby immediately SEES his family, though they don't see him yet. To Rosario, quiet: \nBOBBY GREEN That's them there. In the corner. Lookit `em--two peas in a pod. \nROSARIO DIAZ Yeah--I see `em! They don't look that bad though, you know? For cops? (re: Michael, Jack) Who're those other guys? \nBOBBY GREEN [My] Father's friends--they were all in Korea together. (with a laugh) Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs... (moves closer) Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll get out quicker. \nROSARIO DIAZ (beat; darkening) I ain't gonna embarrass you. \nBOBBY GREEN N--I just wanna get out quick, that's all... \nACROSS THE ROOM \nBobby approaches, looks over to Sandra. The two nod an AWKWARD HELLO. Then the two brothers meet. We SEE the relationship between them. Strained, but a warmth deep UNDERNEATH: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby, hey! You, you got off work and everything-- \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah I did so...congratulations... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSIMULTANEOUS: Burt motions to JACK, MICHAEL.      The two WALK UPSTAIRS. Burt steps forward. \nBURT GRUSINSKY Hello. \nBOBBY GREEN Pop. (Rosario moves near) Everybody, this is my girlfriend. Rosario. \nROSARIO DIAZ Nice to meet you! \nBOBBY GREEN This's my brother. And my father. \nBurt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with subdued \"hellos.\" She is not exactly, well, PROPER- LOOKING. And she isn't white. She picks up on this, tries to act as though she doesn't care. Burt turns to Bobby: \nBURT GRUSINSKY We gotta talk to you. Alone. \nANGLE ON BOBBY. This gives him pause, but Rosario gives him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay. So: \nINT. CHURCH - UPSTAIRS \nJack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church. Looking for anyone who may be hanging out, ducking in and around. They spot a COUPLE, making out in one of the pews. The man is shirtless, the woman in her bra. Caught, they let out an embarrassed CHUCKLE. With offense, but also humor: \nMICHAEL SOLO In a house of God, no less? C'mon, get up... \nThe couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their clothes. As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph coming up the stairs. Joseph pulls up the rear, standing behind his father. Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated several rows back. BEAT, then: \nMICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on. \nBobby gladly gives a nod of recognition, sits down in an empty front pew. Burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Your hair's long. \nJoseph lingers, leaves. Father and son. ALONE. Then, staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette: \nBOBBY GREEN Congratulations. You got me up here. \nBURT GRUSINSKY I knew you wouldn't help us. I told your brother, I said, `no point even bringing him down here.' \nBOBBY GREEN Good.   Then now you know. \nBobby starts to leave.   Burt grabs his arm: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Hold on a second--lemme ask you a question. That girl of yours downstairs--she Puerto Rican? \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah.   I like the dark meat. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nBURT GRUSINSKY She hooking you up? \nBOBBY GREEN (lets out a chuckle) Why, you want some? \nBURT GRUSINSKY Yeah, keep laughing--your mother, rest in peace, I think she was too easy on you. \nBOBBY GREEN I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you `round. \nBobby turns his back on Burt, getting up to walk downstairs. Burt remains emotional, reaching out to his son when Bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail. \nINT. BASEMENT \nThe music is off now. Bobby comes down, Burt follows. Joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another cop. A squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: NYPD Deputy Commissioner SPIRO GIAVANNIS. \nSPIRO GIAVANNIS Everyone?   Everyone! \nRosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching the party. She stares down a GUY who OGLES HER LASCIVIOUSLY. With a sense of humor, she winks at him: \nROSARIO DIAZ You take a picture, it'll last longer. \nBobby approaches Rosario, grabs her hand: \nBOBBY GREEN C'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with Jumbo. \nHe tugs her away.   She stops him.   With assurance: \nROSARIO DIAZ We could stay if you want, baby. They don't like me, I don't care-- you're better than them anyway-- \nBOBBY GREEN (waves her off) We're goin'. C'mon. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe hurriedly puts down her drink. Joe stands near Spiro, but his attention is on his brother: \nSPIRO GIAVANNIS I'm Deputy Commissioner Spiro GIAVANNIS-- \nAPPLAUSE.    Bobby, Rosario move to the exit.   SIMULTANEOUS: \nSPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D) You know, we look around in these troubled times, and in moments like this we need leaders, men and women who can bring order back to our great communities. We're here this holiday season to give thanks for one of these men, our Russian brother, Joseph Grusinsky. \nCHEERS.   Joseph smiles, waves.   Filled with hubris. \nSPIRO GIAVANNIS (CONT'D) ...Joseph, many of us've known your father, Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky, for many years, and I know he wants to say a little something. Chief? \nAPPLAUSE for Burt, who waves, steps up: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Thank you. You know, I used to tell my kids, \"work first, play later,\" and my son Joseph really took it to heart. He's been a real fighter over the years... He overcome his mother's passing, and the dyslexia--eventually wound up graduating John Jay as salutatorian and distinguished himself many times. (turns to Joseph) Anyway, you've shown yourself to be very brave and selfless, and I'm just, I'm very proud here tonight. \nBIG APPLAUSE as JOSEPH STEPS FORWARD. BOBBY AND ROSARIO squeeze through the crowd, to the stairs. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Thank you everybody for coming-- happy Thanksgiving. Before I say anything else... We got some bad news this morning. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) One of our Irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night--detective Edward Conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on Northern Boulevard. The clock's about to strike ten, so I thought we might give a moment of silence to remember. \nBOBBY STOPS. Instinctively, he turns back to the room, motions to Rosario to stop. Out of respect. She does. Then: the CHURCH BELL rings. TEN TIMES. Silence. The BELL GONGS. The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT, and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE, genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return the glare, and Bobby exits... \nEXT. QUEENS STREET - FRONT OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nThe camera TILTS UP to an apartment window.   We CUT INSIDE: \nINT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM \nMUSIC UP: PRINCE'S \"HOUSEQUAKE.\" Hot girls and flashy- looking guys. The men are drinking. The women make themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's, though not exaggeratedly so. DRUGS are EVERYWHERE. We MOVE PAST THIS TO: \nINT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM \nPAN around the ROOM: a set of weights on the carpeted floor, with clothes scattered everywhere; on the wall, a Jets football schedule, a Led Zeppelin poster. Bobby is PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT. \nROSARIO DIAZ I'm gonna be like Madonna. You think I'm like Madonna...? \nBobby sees Rosario in the reflection; his face lights up. \nROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) We're both Leos, you know. \nBOBBY GREEN You're just like her, baby... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBobby opens his top drawer to get a watch. REVEALS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake drawer bottom. Traces his fingers across the money with private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she pulls out a small box. She hides it. Then: \nJACK SHAPIRO What if your brother's inside? \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY It's his day off. He ain't gonna be there. \nJoseph clicks his weapon into place. \nMICHAEL SOLO What if he is?    We still go? \nJoseph is deeply troubled by the prospect. \nMICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) What's it gonna be? \nANGLE ON JOSEPH. \nEXT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB \nMob scene.    Bobby and Rosario and Louis and the gang enter. \nINT. EL CARIBE - CLUB ENTRANCE \nBobby gleefully shakes hands upon entering, then splits from the group. Rosario joins several girls as they fix themselves up in front of large lobby mirrors... \nINT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM \nOpening the door is Kalina, who embraces him.   In Russian: \nKALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) Bobby! Our daughter and her husband Eli come by for dinner. You want something, some tea? \nBOBBY GREEN No no, I'm all right... Hi everybody... \nA grown woman, Marat's daughter MASHA, waves while sifting through a stack of FURS on the sofa. One of her young children, a daughter, holds her hand. \nINT. DINING ROOM \nMarat sits at the head of a table with lots of FOOD (including a HUGE SMOKED FISH) on it. He waves Bobby over, ebullient. ELI MIRICHENKO, Masha's husband, is seated here, too--trying to talk to his young toddler SON. Bobby sits down, next to Marat. \nBOBBY GREEN Everything's really rockin' tonight. Line's halfway `round the block. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Yes, it's good... \nThe toddler runs to Bobby. Bobby lifts the youngster onto his knee; as he bounces the child on his knee, he turns back to Marat: \nBOBBY GREEN You wanted to talk to me? \nMarat nods, waves to Kalina for drinks. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV You know, maybe we open another spot next year. Across from Brighton. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN 'S a good move. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV We need someone in charge here full- time, then. And we think you do a great job. \nBOBBY GREEN I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you. (BEAT) I mean, I got a lot of ideas. \nKALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) (EXCITED) Already! He's got so many ideas! \nBOBBY GREEN Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami. \nMarat nods, considering this. Reaches to the FISH. He takes the EYE out of the fish and starts to suck on it. Daughter Masha stands behind her seated husband, holding and bouncing her little girl. ELI antes up, to Marat: \nELI MIRICHENKO That's gonna take a lot of money, Papa. Your fur business can support that right now? \nMarat waves him off.    Turns back to Bobby, re Eli: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV My son-in-law, he worries people take advantage of me. \nBOBBY GREEN I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights? (BEAT) What do you think? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMarat grins from ear to ear.   Excitedly, he nods.   Then: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Yes. Together we do it. You come to our Thanksgiving again, on Thursday? \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah, sure.   I'll come. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Good--we talk more, at the dinner. \nThe two hug. Bobby is being shown out by Kalina, and is about to depart when Buzhayev calls to his wife in Russian: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) Give him, for tonight! \nShe reaches for her purse.   But Bobby refuses graciously, waving it off as he exits: \nBOBBY GREEN Nah nah, no thank you... \nINT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM \nA LARGE NEON SUN is lowered from the top of the theater. Sitting on it, singing: `80's POP STAR TAYLOR DANE. The CROWD GOES NUTS. As this happens: BOBBY ENTERS, sits down at a table against the back wall. Louis is next to him. \nLOUIS FALSETTI My brother! How'd it go? (Bobby smiles, winks) Ho, well! I'm guessing it went pretty good then! \nBOBBY GREEN Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Yeah... Smart smart stupid. Got his head buried in books all day, `stead of the real world... \nAD-LIB amusement from the \"yes\" men.   Vadim moves closer: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) Listen uh, I come to you, I tell you I got some friends bringin' a load in here, maybe something big-- I'm just talking now--they bring it in, how do you feel about that? \nBOBBY GREEN Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Well, upstairs don't gotta know everything, am I right? Place gets packed every night, everybody wins. \nBobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who shout out hellos. Vadim shakes Bobby's shoulder with affection. Intimate: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) You know, you should think about comin' in with us. You're popular-- you could help us...expand a little. A lotta money in it. \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah...I'll think about that. Rosario--I wanna talk to you. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Go ahead.   We'll talk. \nBobby takes Rosario by the arm away from the table. \nTHE BAR \nAs Bobby moves with Rosario to the bar: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROSARIO DIAZ It go good upstairs, baby? \nBOBBY GREEN You gotta stop dealing. You hear what I'm telling you? \nThese words hit Rosario, and we SEE that she's troubled by her own behavior because she stares at her shoes, momentarily speechless. He grabs her: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You hear what I said? \nROSARIO DIAZ Yeah, I heard. But I need the money right now, Bobby. And I'm not gonna rely on you for EVERYTHING-- \nBobby purses his lips, frustrated.     Then: \nBOBBY GREEN Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons. \nMomentarily confused, she mutters a \"'kay,\" then kisses him. Bobby moves the hair from Rosario's face. \nROSARIO DIAZ I love you... \nBOBBY'S ABOUT TO RESPOND IN KIND WHEN...       All of a SUDDEN: BOOM! PANIC. SCREAMING. LIGHTS. \nThe DOORS at the club's entrance have burst open. LOUD, like a gunshot. COPS enter. Plainclothes and uniformed both. JOSEPH comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs around his neck. WITH COMMAND: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Everybody! Get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move! (to a woman) Turn off that music. Right now! \nFOUR UNIFORMED COPS BOLT straight to    the COAT CHECK AREA. ALL KINDS OF DRUGS and WEAPONS start    falling to the FLOOR. The patrons are desperate to get rid    of any incriminating evidence, and BOTH MEN AND WOMEN RUN    TO THE BATHROOMS. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM \nSeveral patrons start DUMPING NARCOTICS INTO THE TOILET BOWLS when MANY COPS ENTER and, with ferocity, hit them with batons to corral them. The TOILETS are backing up... \nINT. WOMEN'S ROOM \nSome girls rush in, others are already inside. Two PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN are in the corner, FREEBASING, when COPS BURST IN. One of the Pretty Girls, out of surprise, starts to shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it. The opposite occurs, and the flame IGNITES THE ETHER. THE TWO GIRLS BURST INTO FLAMES. \nCOPS Holy shit! Get the extinguishers-- call paramedics! \nINT. MAIN ROOM \nThe cops pin EVERYONE up against the wall or on the ground. EVERYONE IS LINED UP, SEARCHED. I.D.s are checked. Bobby turns to Rosario: \nBOBBY GREEN Gimme your shit! \nTroubled, she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his palm. Bobby quickly SWALLOWS them. A UNIFORMED COP approaches Bobby: \nUNIFORMED COP Hey! I saw that! Get your hands on your fuckin' head! \nBobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched; Rosario is tossed aside. The Uniformed Cop, to someone else: \nUNIFORMED COP (CONT'D) Jessie!   This one just ingested! \nAll patrons in the club, with rare exception, get forcibly lined up, HANDS CLASPED on the backs of their heads. PARAMEDICS SPEED to the LADIES' ROOM. JESSIE THE COP takes out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal: \nPARAMEDIC Arright, open up--a little charcoal, to absorb the toxin... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAs Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Give everybody a toss. G.Q.-- \nThis gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to LOUIS, pokes his gut: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Too much pizza, right there. \nSeveral COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart. (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Turn around...    Turn around! \nVadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) What is this? (BEAT) Want me to double your money? Huh? \nBURT GRUSINSKY Don't EVER speak to me like that again. You hear me? I'll rap you right in the mouth! \nBOBBY GREEN You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna fuckin' touch me?!? \nBobby COCKS HIS FIST. BUT BURT IS READY. A STANDOFF. Then Bobby decides against it, bolts. On BURT as we GO TO: \nINT. MARAT'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBOBBY ENTERS. Packed with people. A family get-together for Thanksgiving. Children abound, a PARTY atmosphere. BOBBY is in the FOYER, holding a cake he's brought. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSeveral FURS laid out on a felt-covered bench. Into the LIVING ROOM, he sees Masha and ELI seated on the couch, holding the hand of their son, who is dressed in a striped suit. Upon seeing Bobby, ELI NODS TO HIM and Masha enters the foyer, greeting Bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and taking the wrapped present from him. \nINT. DINING ROOM \nBobby enters. Sitting at the large table is MARAT, playing with one of his grandchildren. Bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance. When Buzhayev spots him, the child hides behind Marat's leg. Marat lets out a laugh at this; to the child: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV No no--it's okay. Say hello... \nThe boy waves perfunctorily. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) Now--we go this week to the field, okay? To ride the horses? Go to Mama. \nMarat addresses the boy clutching his leg (AD-LIB a Russian \"go\"), kisses him, and the child runs off. Bobby steps closer to Marat: \nBOBBY GREEN Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry about what happened the other night. (BEAT) [If] I was working, maybe I would've been able to do something, but... Anyway, I'm sorry. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV It's not your fault... \nMarat darkens considerably. More interior tone, almost as much for himself as for Bobby: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) You can't always control everyone in your family... (BEAT) My nephew, he don't come back to the club anymore. \nMarat brings his hand to his head, looks pained. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN You don't mind my saying, I think that's probably the right thing to do. (BEAT) Things get back to normal, I'm hoping we could get started on what we talked about. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (shakes his head) We need time for the bad publicity to go away. \nBOBBY GREEN Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. I don't got a record-- \nWith great effort, Marat stands. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV I know.   I don't worry about any of that. \nHe puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) I used to teach chemistry before I come over here, and now I have the fur store, and this. One thing I learned here, you can always start over. So don't worry--someday, we do it. Okay? Someday. \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah...   All right... \nKALINA BUZHAYEV (O.C.; SUBTITLE) Food is ready! \nMarat looks at Bobby with great sympathy as they walk toward the LIVING ROOM. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV You take some time off, everything will be fixed in a little bit. Then you come back. I pay you for the time. Come on... \nBobby mutters a \"THANK YOU.\" Buzhayev touches his cheek. Marat then turns back into THE DINING ROOM, spreading his arms affectionately and wide, yelling \"OHHH\" to the children as they cheer. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we GO TO: \nINT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - UPSTAIRS OFFICE \nPresent: Joseph, Michael, Jack. Joe's seated at the head of a long table, which is covered with coffee, deli sandwich remnants, and police reports, etc. They are working; we greet them in media res. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY He stabbed himself, he was a bundle guy. Mighta known how they're movin' it. See, that's the key-- \nALL OF A SUDDEN, IN COMES BOBBY.   Intense beat.    Finally: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) We waited `til it was your day off. (BEAT) We had to go--I'm sorry. \nBeat.   Bobby takes a step toward him: \nBOBBY GREEN You had to hit that spot. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby! What am I supposed to do--announce it in advance, compromise the whole thing? (BEAT) C'mon. \nBOBBY GREEN I had plans down there. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah, well, I tried. What do you want from me, anyway? You know, you're standing there feeling sorry for yourself, but you wouldn't be in this shit if you didn't fuck around in the first place. \nBOBBY GREEN You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop-- \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby, you're the one acting like you're above it all all the time! (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Fuckin' around with your little Puerto Rican all day-- \nBOBBY GREEN What did you call her? \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY You heard me. Have some fucking class for once. \nBobby takes another confrontational step forward.       Raging: \nBOBBY GREEN You piece of shit... \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (ignoring him) [You] go around like you're a big shot... You're a joke! Grow up already! Fuckin' loser... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSTOCKY LATINO MAN Call. \nBobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR.    Turns over his cards.    He has a pair of QUEENS: \nBOBBY GREEN Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking queens! \nSTOCKY LATINO MAN Goddamnit! \nA pair of tens. Bobby stands, CLAPS ONCE.       Lou, thrilled, jumps up and HUGS Bobby. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bobkes, I love you! \nRosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she calls out to Bobby: \nROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--it's for you! \nBOBBY GREEN Who is it? \nShe shakes her head as if to say, \"I don't know.\" Slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the table. As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly: \nLOUIS FALSETTI I was the one told him to keep goin'! \nThen Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the phone, several feet away from the ruckus. He covers his free ear with his hand to hear better: \nBOBBY GREEN Hello? \nMICHAEL SOLO (PHONE FILTER) Bobby, it's Michael Solo--I got some bad news. (BEAT) Your brother's been shot. He's at St. John's--they're workin' on him now. I just thought you should know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBobby, of course, is stunned. The poker table in the background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message Bobby's getting. He turns his back to the crowd; sotto: \nBOBBY GREEN Is--is he gonna be all right? \nMICHAEL SOLO Listen, your father's coming--I gotta go. But he's at St. John's. \nHANG UP. Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same. Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him. \nROSARIO DIAZ Bobby? \nBOBBY GREEN My brother was shot...they're operating on him now. \nRosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is.     She pulls him to her: \nROSARIO DIAZ You gotta go see him--be there for him and your father. \nBobby eyes her, walks to the table.      A CLOSE SHOT on him. \nBOBBY GREEN Game's over, everybody. \nSTOCKY LATINO MAN What, you shuttin' it down?!? \nBOBBY GREEN That's right.    I gotta go. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Bobkes--?   What's wrong? \nSTOCKY LATINO MAN Fuck you, man!    We're in deep here! \nBobby grabs his coat. Rosario responds in kind, moves to Bobby. He spins to her. In hushed tones: \nBOBBY GREEN What're you doing? \nROSARIO DIAZ I wanna come too. For you-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBOBBY GREEN No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. I'll call you later. \nROSARIO DIAZ BOBBY-- \nBOBBY GREEN Don't argue. \nBobby moves to Louis: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Louis, lock up and take her home. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (confused, he nods) Sure, Bob. Everything cool? \nHurt, Rosario spins around and enters Bobby's room, closing the door behind her. \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta do something, that's all-- \nPats Louis' arm as if to reassure him. Then the Latino Man tries to grab some of the pot. OTHER PLAYERS REVOLT: \nOTHER PLAYERS Hey--HEY!     What the fuck?!? \nA FIGHT BREAKS OUT. Louis moves over to the WOMEN, holding them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with): \nLOUIS FALSETTI Take it easy, TAKE IT EASY! Calm down and everything'll be, uh, non compos mentis! \nPUSHING, SHOVING. PUNCHING. Bobby exits his place, leaving behind Rosario and Louis and chaos... \nA large room, lit by fluorescents. Mostly empty of furniture in the center, with vending machines against the wall and a sole IBM PC in a corner. A huge GUN RACK is on the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to come. It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael. Bobby's been telling his story. He and Burt are seated--Jack looks out the small window in the door, then turns the LOCK for privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing: \nMICHAEL SOLO Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!? \nBobby looks at his father, then nods.      Mouths an almost INAUDIBLE: \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah... \nMichael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt. \nMICHAEL SOLO We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right now. \nANGLE ON BURT.    He betrays no hint of concern: \nBURT GRUSINSKY No. They'll be back on the street in a day. We gotta try and catch `em with their hands full--find out where they got the real weight. Then we can move. \nMICHAEL SOLO That could take us forever! \nBURT GRUSINSKY Doesn't matter. It's our only play. \nUncustomarily, Jack speaks: \nJACK SHAPIRO I say we go hit `em all. Wipe `em out, suicide-by-cop-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY What're you talkin' about?! C'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACK SHAPIRO But we don't got the time to infiltrate `em-- \nBurt lets his temper flare; briefly, we SEE a more mature version of Bobby: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Then we make the time! (to Mike, Bobby) Look, I want you all to understand something--we don't ever play in the dirt here, okay? Not ever, no matter what! (BEAT) You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long. \nMICHAEL SOLO What about callin' in the Feds? They got a lot more juice than we DO-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY Bunch of college boys from Kansas. We protect our own here. \nBobby sees an opening: \nBOBBY GREEN Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him. \nMICHAEL SOLO How you know about that, Bobby? \nBOBBY GREEN (somewhat sheepish) They been wanting me to buy in for a while. \nMichael turns to the others.    Brightening: \nMICHAEL SOLO Well, maybe that's it, then. If we can get him-- (re: Bobby) To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in-- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJACK SHAPIRO (pointing to Bobby; with some ridicule) It'd have to be him-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY Forget it, both of you. \nBOBBY GREEN What do you mean, set something up? \nBURT GRUSINSKY BOBBY-- \nMICHAEL SOLO You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later. That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY That's too dangerous for him! We don't know how solid his cover is out there! (to Bobby) That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion please? \nA beat.   Bobby is dead serious: \nBOBBY GREEN Pop? \nBURT GRUSINSKY What? \nBOBBY GREEN You could trust her. \nBURT GRUSINSKY Good. I'm glad. But it's not happening. So forget it. \nBOBBY GREEN But...but you could get killed-- \nBURT GRUSINSKY Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself, arright? Anything happens with your brother I'll call you. Goodbye. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nA beat.   Bobby is still there, fixated. \nBURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) Goodbye! \nFinally, Bobby exits.   We GO TO: \nINT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nBobby enters his room, which is dark. Rosario is here, asleep. Her back to Bobby. Upon hearing him enter, she turns and looks at him (and US) in SLOW MOTION... \nBobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back. She senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep: \nROSARIO DIAZ Everything okay? (BEAT) They said on the television your brother was doing better. \nBobby nods. \nROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Me and my mother, we said a prayer for him. \nBobby takes the BEEPER.     Michael touches his shoulder: \nMICHAEL SOLO (CONT'D) Just be smart about things. Okay? You get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead. An informant dies, they talk about you for a day. A week later, ain't no one remembers your name. (BEAT) Moral of the story is, don't die. You understand? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nANGLE ON BOBBY as he sobers.   Nods.   Then: \nBOBBY GREEN You need to promise me something, though. You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better. \nMICHAEL SOLO She won't be a target. Just make sure she don't open her mouth. \nBOBBY GREEN I'll take care of it. \nMichael grabs Bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection. \nMICHAEL SOLO You know we known you your whole life, kid? Good luck. \nINT. BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LATER \nBobby enters the bedroom. Presses his answering machine button, and a message begins to play. It is Rosario. \nROSARIO DIAZ'S VOICE Hi, Bobby. It's me. Just wanted to see how you were doing--I guess you're at the hospital now... I hope your family's doing good... Okay, I love you... Jumbo says hello too... \nAs her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser, where he opens the top drawer. INSIDE: THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS--his SAVINGS. He begins to take the money out of the drawer and count it when: we HEAR a SOFT BUZZ. He quickly looks over, CHECKS THE BEEPER. He stares at the paged number... \nEXT. FLUSHING MEADOW PARK - FOGGY DUSK \nA MAN #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog. He is stocky, dressed in a down vest. Bobby enters the frame, trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment, then Bobby holds out the beeper. The man takes it. \nMAN #1 takes out A KEL DEVICE LISTENING UNIT and its accessories. Among them, a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. He UNSCREWS THE LIGHTER. Complex electronic innards. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN #1 Your wire's in here--we're gonna follow the signal. Find the stash house and make the deal, you leave the rest to us. \nBOBBY GREEN You gonna leave me all alone out there? \nMAN #1 (shrugs; then) I ain't gonna lie to you.   There's always a risk. \nMan #1 hands Bobby the LIGHTER.    He FIRES it.    It works. \nMAN #1 (CONT'D) Your cover's blown, call for help-- don't try and be a hero. Just get outta the way--place could turn into a butcher shop. Talk about pussy--that'll be our signal to come in early. \nBOBBY GREEN You come up with that one all by yourself? \nMAN #1 (ignores the joke) Just do the deal and get out. Bear in mind, your life is in that lighter. Anything goes wrong, the department'll get word to your father. \nThe Man unceremoniously turns to leave.     Then, suddenly: \nMAN #1 (CONT'D) And oh--G.Q. told me to tell you-- your brother's coming along real good. They reset his jaw and sometimes he's awake. \nBobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head. The man departs. Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the man as he virtually disappears back into the fog... \nINT. CHURCH - EARLY EVENING \nIt is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior. A line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they walk toward the altars. A HEALING MASS. Rosario is here. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the pew, she SEES BOBBY and approaches. Bobby looks around, seeming harried and paranoid... \nROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--what're you doing here? \nBobby looks at her, his eyes filled with emotion. \nBOBBY GREEN I--I need to talk to you. \nROSARIO DIAZ I'm coming home in a little bit. \nHe doesn't respond at all. \nROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Bobby? \nHe appears almost in tears...    Finally, sotto: \nBOBBY GREEN I--I'm gonna inform. For the police. (BEAT) I'm gonna help `em set up Nezhinski. \nRosario is shocked.     Almost inaudible: \nROSARIO DIAZ What...? \nAs she steps back, he moves forward: \nBOBBY GREEN I had to do it, Rosario. These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father. \nRosario tries to recover.    Can barely speak.     Sotto: \nROSARIO DIAZ But Nezhinski finds out, he'd kill YOU-- \nBOBBY GREEN He ain't ever gonna find out.    He ain't ever gonna know. \nROSARIO DIAZ But what if something goes wrong? What's gonna happen to you?!? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBOBBY GREEN I don't know... I'd, I'd probably have to go into protection. \nBobby takes the front passenger seat.      Pavel is behind him. Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE. Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay calm... \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY Put your hands out, where I could see `em. \nBOBBY GREEN You know me. \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it! \nBobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything incriminating. To the driver: \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D) Turn at the light... \nThe CAR makes A SHARP LEFT.      In Russian, subtitled: \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D) Go left.    Again. \nEXT. STREET \nThe Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires screeching just slightly. \nINT. LIVERY CAR \nPavel again: \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE Let's go.   No one's on us. \nThe camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY... \nEXT. STREET \nThe Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere. Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car. They pull Bobby out: \nINT. TENEMENT HALLWAY \nThey walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps. He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door. \nINT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM \nSomeone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present, through the sequence. \nIt could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room. \nIN THE HALLWAY \nStands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head to Bobby. \"FOLLOW ME,\" he seems to be saying. \nINT. BEDROOM \nBobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them. There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding. \nThere are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics. \nThe SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown- Haired Man, puts up two fingers. \nOn cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk, Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall. \nThis is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING: TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo. \nHe takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps from the package. \nBobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY LETTER OPENER... \nThe Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show. \nCLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot. He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI'S VOICE You needed to come here tonight...? \nBobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI What's the matter, ain't Pavel good enough for you? \nBOBBY GREEN That's all the money I got.    And I ain't gonna leave it alone. \nThe Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash: \nSLAVIC YOUTH It's all there.     Fifty grand. \nVadim points to the MONEY: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Where'd you get this? \nBOBBY GREEN From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (nods; then:) That buys you three keys in here. (BEAT) With the crack on the street, it's worth two hundred k. Maybe more. \nBobby gets up, into a crouch, amidst the gunfire.    Dodging the bullets. \nAn ESU Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally, and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby. Bobby screams, his hands raised: \nBOBBY GREEN I'm with you!     I'm with YOU! \nThis is INAUDIBLE, with all the ammo being dispensed, and Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer begins to unload his weapon, getting CLOSER to BOBBY. \nAND CLOSER. \nAND CLOSER.     Bobby is about to be killed when: \nHE SEES HIS CHANCE. HE CHARGES BACKWARD. WITH FEROCIOUS DETERMINATION, HE THROWS HIMSELF OUT A NEARBY WINDOW. \nTHE PANE SHATTERS. BOBBY TUMBLES THROUGH, HIS FACE AND BODY RIDDLED WITH SHARDS OF GLASS. \nEXT. TENEMENT \nBobby FALLS roughly twenty feet through the air. His body tumbles upside-down, toward a wrought-iron FENCE that surrounds the base of the apartment building's side. \nBobby HITS the FENCE. His LEG GETS CAUGHT on one of the small spikes. He SCREAMS as we GO BACK TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING \nCop cars pull up by the dozen, from EVERYWHERE. Out of one comes BURT GRUSINSKY, carrying a shotgun. He charges right into the structure... \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM \nNezhinski opens the window, about to go out onto the fire escape. A WARRANT UNIT OFFICER is below. Looks up: \nWARRANT UNIT OFFICER Halt!   Police! \nBEHIND HIM: \nJACK SHAPIRO Hold it right there! Hands on your head! \nVADIM SPINS AROUND.   FREEZES.   His hands are in the air. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Don't shoot! \nOfficers pour in, among them BURT. Cops forcefully push Vadim to the ground. Start to cuff him. Burt pulls Jack ASIDE: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Where's my goddamned kid?!? \nJack is speechless--he doesn't know. (We SEE that Burt's question--revealing Bobby's identity--REGISTERS on VADIM'S FACE.) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE) He is a dead man... \nOFFICERS (not comprehending) Shut up! Get down! \nBurt frantically PUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD OF COPS... \nEXT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - ALLEYWAY \nBobby is upside-down, hanging from the fence, but he is alert. Two members of the EMERGENCY SERVICES UNIT approach him. \nOn sheer instinct alone, he starts to PULL his LEG off the small SPIKE, his teeth clenched. An ARMY of ESU TROOPS and PARAMEDICS come to BOBBY'S AID... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY is being lowered from the fence. An AMBULANCE ZOOMS UP the STREET, to the alley. Burt rushes to his son. Jack and Mike come right behind him. Bobby looks at his father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass. Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's gaze. \nBURT GRUSINSKY Jesus. \nEMERGENCY SERVICES GUY He's gonna be okay, Chief. (to others) Clear out! \nBurt eases when he hears this. They move Bobby toward the ambulance. Burt turns to Michael. Sotto: \nBURT GRUSINSKY You guys go on a bust like this and you don't tell me about it? You think I'm born yesterday? \nMICHAEL SOLO I guess we do. \nBURT GRUSINSKY You're a real comedian! He's gonna need to be in protection now! \nINT. AMBULANCE \nBobby sits up on the stretcher as a MEDIC treats his leg. Burt approaches, watches for a moment. The Medic leaves the post for a moment, and the two are ALONE. Burt stares at his son, who finally speaks: \nBOBBY GREEN I'll be all right, Pop. \nBURT GRUSINSKY (shakes head; then:) Well, I guess I don't have a say in anything anymore. Anyway... You did it. You did it and it took real balls. (BEAT) But now you're burnt--and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep you under wraps for awhile. \nBOBBY GREEN I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBurt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came to death. Trying not to show it--and failing. \nBURT GRUSINSKY I'll get them to take care of that. Just go get yourself fixed up-- that's the most important thing. \nWith that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt closes the ambulance door. Bobby is alone with the Medic for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through the window as his father walks to his car. Bobby sinks to the cot, lies down. AS VADIM NEZHINSKI is LED AWAY in HANDCUFFS... \nBLACKNESS. \nFADE IN: \nA LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL: the STORY is about the BUST: MAJOR NARCOTICS SEIZURE, 40 KILOS OF COCAINE. An OFFICER is KILLED; Two PERPETRATORS (among them: PAVEL and the SLAVIC MAN) KILLED. Four others wounded. \nMORE THAN A DOZEN ARRESTS. We SEE the PERPS, lined up against the walls. VADIM NEZHINSKI'S MUG SHOT. We're told he's AWAITING TRIAL. In a RELATED STORY-- \nBOBBY GREEN I'm real glad you're home... \nThe two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSANDRA GRUSINSKY Everyone, let's, let's move inside-- there's plenty to eat! \nSoft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates, moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY We could do it now if you want, Pop. In the den. \nBurt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den-- except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She approaches him. \nROSARIO DIAZ Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the motel. \nBOBBY GREEN What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something? \nROSARIO DIAZ (shakes her head) N--I'm gonna go back. \nA beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question: \nBOBBY GREEN (WHISPERED) You fucked up? \nA muttered \"no\" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial. Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his head out: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial. \nBurt motions for Bobby to enter the den.       Back to Rosario: \nBOBBY GREEN We gotta straighten this out later. \nBobby then moves to the den. \nINT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN \nBurt and Joseph and Jack and Mike.    Bobby enters the room. As he does, we HEAR: \nMICHAEL SOLO Nezhinski's cache was huge, about 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too. \nBURT GRUSINSKY We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in. But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop. \nBobby closes the door behind him softly.       Joseph sees Bobby, is surprised he's here... \nBURT GRUSINSKY Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Where is he? \nJACK SHAPIRO He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice and comfy. We're taking him to the A.D.A. next week, for a meeting. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY I wanna go with you on that. See his fuckin' face. \nJack nods. \nMICHAEL SOLO I'll tell you, though--streets're dead. Junkies're waitin' out there for something big, no question. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY That's `cause we got their number one. Dried it up at the source. \nAll of a sudden, a VOICE from behind: \nBOBBY GREEN That don't mean nothing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEveryone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened his mouth here: \nBURT GRUSINSKY What's that, Bobby? \nBOBBY GREEN There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby--you done a lot for us already. You don't gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay? \nBURT GRUSINSKY I asked him to come in, Joe. If he's gonna have to testify, he should know all this. \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY This's police business, Pop--you gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now? \nAn ugly beat.    Then: \nBOBBY GREEN I'll be outside if you need me. \nBobby exits, and Burt watches him depart. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nThe unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt comes up next to him, takes him into a corner: \nBURT GRUSINSKY BOBBY-- (SOTTO) What was said in there, he--he didn't mean it. \nBobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his father's words. Then: \nBOBBY GREEN Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready. \n(CONTINUED) \nSlight comfort. She nods. Bobby leans over, kisses her. He tenderly puts his hand on her face. She kisses his hand. Their GUARDS are WATCHING. She smiles, and that love returns: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise... \nFADE OUT. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nFADE IN: \nEXT. OUTSIDE RIKER'S ISLAND PRISON - EARLY MORNING \nVadim Nezhinski is being led, in handcuffs, into an unmarked Chevy. Both JOSEPH and Jack are here. Joseph and Vadim exchange looks as Vadim is placed into the back seat. Joe's expression is pure suppressed rage... \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY I'll go in the lead car. You stay with him `til we get to the A.D.A.'s. \nJACK SHAPIRO You got it... \nJoseph gets in his lead car, also an unmarked Chevy.    Both vehicles pull away from the curb... \nINT. STAIRWELL - OUTSIDE MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT \nWe SEE Bobby's ARMED GUARDS waiting on the steps.    TILT UP TO the closed door. Over this, we HEAR: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (O.S.) We heard all about you in the news. We were all very sorry about your brother. \nINT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - RAINY DAY \nBobby and Marat Buzhayev, inside the living room.   Bobby sits down, on the couch's armrest; Marat is in an easy chair, his lunch being served on a T.V. tray in front of him by his wife Kalina. The television plays a Russian movie, and Marat seasons his food. \nBOBBY GREEN Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV I could talk to him. I think he would like you very much. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN I'd appreciate it. \nMarat turns to Bobby, puts his hand on his knee. Emotional: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV We're going to be very sad if you're going. Having you here in this house meant a lot to us. You know, my wife and me, we have only daughters. \nBOBBY GREEN You always been very important to me too. (checks his watch) I should probably go now. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Bobby--you'll always be welcome back here. \nBobby is moved.    The two embrace. \nINT. VADIM'S COP CAR \nThe car is moving. Jack is driving. Another cop is in the front passenger seat. Two other cops straddle Vadim. Silence, then, motioning toward Joseph's car: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI They did good.    On his face. \nJACK SHAPIRO Shut your fuckin' mouth. \nINT. JOSEPH'S CAR \nAs Joseph looks back at Vadim's vehicle, behind him: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY He makes a deal today, maybe my brother don't gotta take the stand... Least that's something... \nINT. VADIM'S COP CAR \nJack puts a cigarette in his mouth, turns to the cop next to him: \nJACK SHAPIRO Give me that lighter. \nALL OF A SUDDEN: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA VAN CROSSES THE LINE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. COMES RIGHT TOWARD THEM, SLAMMING INTO PASSENGER'S SIDE. EXPLOSIVE. A THUNDERING SOUND, GLASS EVERYWHERE. THE COP IN THE PASSENGER'S SEAT FLIES RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. He's probably killed. \nINT. JOSEPH'S CAR \nThe cops see this accident.     The DRIVER: \nDRIVER Holy shit! \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Stop the fuckin' car! \nAs Joseph PULLS OUT HIS GUN, READYING HIMSELF TO DO BATTLE, ANOTHER CAR PULLS IN BETWEEN THEM. AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE immediately pins Joseph and the other two police inside the vehicle. \nINT. VADIM'S COP CAR \nTHREE MEN IN SKI MASKS emerge from the van, automatic WEAPONS IN HAND. JACK PULLS OUT HIS PIECE and immediately begins firing at them, using the wheel and dashboard as cover. He opens his door to slink out. \nVADIM HITS THE FLOOR. \nThe other two officers are immediately riddled with GUNFIRE. \nTwo of the men PULL VADIM toward them. The third man in a ski mask is hit by Jack's fire, but has just enough adrenaline to get into the SECOND CAR. \nIT SPEEDS AWAY. \nINT. BOBBY'S CAR \nBobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view through the windshield of his father's car. \nBobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible. \nThe cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain: \nBOBBY GREEN It's really coming down... \nROSARIO DIAZ Bobby--I think I left my watch at the hotel-- \nBobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way it's moving... \nBOBBY GREEN Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right! \nVITT THE GUARD (TURNING) Huh--? \nA FLASH! \nCRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle... VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes her head down, into the back seat. \nTHE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt to the side. To Rosario: \nBOBBY GREEN Get down! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from which car it's been dislodged... \nCOMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD. Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves. THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred feet below. \nBobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR-- behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting Bobby's car... \nTHE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the barrel of the gun swing to Burt. \nANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's car has shattered. \nBobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping open. He CAN SEE: \nHIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS. We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL: \nBURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER) They got a hit on! Get support, now! \nBobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the car, one driving and one doing the shooting-- \nBOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear door.   Rosario is JOLTED--screams again... \nBOBBY GREEN Rosario!   You hurt? \nShe shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl. She's hysterical--but physically unharmed. \nThe traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible, blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car, wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many trucks, big and small, on it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThe Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous. \nA TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering and keeping up the pursuit. \nPOLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT... \nThe truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND. \nBOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is TERRIBLE: \nThe truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people inside. \nThe Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt. Into the radio: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Pop, lay back! \nBut Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man in the back seat. HE FIRES. \nA HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile. The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR: \nBURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER) I got him!   I got the sonofabitch! \nAND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear passenger's seat area. \nHis eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP.    THE BARREL OF THE SHOTGUN turns: \nWATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us). The water slides off the glass. \nTHEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT. He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT... \nEXT. STREET \nThrough the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner. \nBOBBY GREEN You gonna fuckin' catch these guys? \nA nod.   Bobby senses uncertainty: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You ain't got nothing, do you. \nMichael looks to Jack, who steps forward: \nJACK SHAPIRO All our uncles on the street been hearing about a big deal, goin' down maybe Monday or Tuesday. (BEAT) They don't know where yet, but...we got a feeling--[now that] Nezhinski's out, he's gonna be there. \nBOBBY GREEN (growing emotional) You gotta find that spot... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMICHAEL SOLO You and your brother don't gotta worry about any of that. Just take the time you need-- \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY MIKE-- \nThe men all turn around.    Joseph stands there, wounded but COMMITTED: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) I'll be ready to come back and head it up. I'll be ready and, and we'll get `em. (BEAT) After the funeral. \nJoseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. Bobby WATCHES him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of the casket. We HEAR: \nBRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM... \nEXT. INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY \nA LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of tombstones. Emerging are Bobby and Joseph. They are both wearing dark sunglasses. Rosario and Sandra and the children get out behind them and are led away by funeral coordinators to another place in the coming processional. In the distance, many many people and a long line of cars move toward the two brothers. \nThe Undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic. Bobby slowly puts his arm around Joseph's waist, prompting: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby... I'm real glad you're with me now... \nBOBBY GREEN Course... \nJoseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses.    Leans to Bobby, clears his throat. Sotto: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY You know, I was...I was jealous of you, [for a] long time. \nBobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment. Joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) ...I always did what Pop wanted. And you were free... \nBobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head: \nBOBBY GREEN No.... I did it to hurt him...   I disappointed him... \nInterrupting the moment, the Undertaker approaches: \nUNDERTAKER Gentlemen? \nThe Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession. Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME, we GO TO: \nMINUTES LATER. \nA line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the HEARSE. The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG. The New York skyline is in the distance. \nUNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road. The COFFIN is removed from the HEARSE, put on WHEELS for the move to the gravesite. Bobby, Joseph approach. The DRUMS CONTINUE: \nBRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM...BRRRRRRRUUUMMM... \nPeople get out of their cars. Many of them we recognize from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA. \nThe walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph. \nBehind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and file of the Force. The turnout is enormous. Rosario is here too, though several rows back. She is with the women. \nBobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds of SALUTING COPS, others. AMONG THEM, we SPOT: \nLOUIS FALSETTI. \nAt that moment, BOBBY SEES his old friend, and the two make EYE CONTACT. Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and sympathetic smile coming across his face... \nSIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more distraught. He breaks down. Bobby is there to catch him and does. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSeveral WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help, and then, trying to recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for support. Tries to straighten: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY ...It's all right... I'll be all right... \nBobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is momentarily rendered speechless. He tightens his own grasp around Joseph, leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN. \nFURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL \nRosario. Walking. Eyeing the Cops, the Cop Wives. She does not fit in. Cops are staring at her. She SEES COP WIVES looking at her, leaning over to each other and TALKING ABOUT HER. Though she can't hear what they're saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy... \nRosario quickens her pace away from them, and the MARCH MOVES ON... \nEXT. GRAVESITE \nThe line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the coffin, which is in the ground. BOBBY and JOSEPH silently lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. Rosario moves behind them. Bobby SEES: BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS: TEENAGERS have climbed the trees. And they're LAUGHING at the spectacle. Michael stands next to Bobby. \nA beat, then Bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied. Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike: \nCONTINUED: (2) BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) What fuckin' life did you have? You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at you! \nROSARIO DIAZ (beat; deeply hurt) And you were clean, Bobby? We were TOGETHER-- \nBOBBY GREEN Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time! \nShe is momentarily speechless. \nROSARIO DIAZ How could you say that...? We had PLANS-- \nBOBBY GREEN Wake up!   All that was nothing! \nROSARIO DIAZ No! Now is nothing! Look at what's happened to your family, Bobby--your father, he's dead--look at your brother! It could all happen to you! \nBOBBY GREEN My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me. \nROSARIO DIAZ That's what you said before. \nA moment, then she turns to walk toward the bedroom. \nBOBBY GREEN Hey--where you goin'-- \nBobby grabs her. \nROSARIO DIAZ Get off me!   Let me go! \nHe holds her by the wrists: \nBOBBY GREEN What the fuck you doin'? \nROSARIO DIAZ Get off me! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nA TUSSLE. As he tries to restrain her, a torrent of emotion explodes from Rosario: \nROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D) Get off me--I don't want it! It's not what I want! \nShe breaks free. Panting, tears streaming down her cheeks. After a beat, Bobby seeks to calm her. \nBOBBY GREEN All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little. \nShe looks at him, frozen. \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you. (BEAT) Why don't you go get some rest? \nWithout a word, she turns and walks back into the bedroom. Closes the door. Bobby sinks to the couch, picks up his drink. After a beat, we HEAR a: \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) We appreciate your patience, Bobby. \nTHE FACE OF SPIRO GIAVANNIS \nAs he looks into the CAMERA. We can't yet TELL where we are. He continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us somewhere not yet in focus: \nSPIRO GIAVANNIS The Commissioner is here now, and he's ready to go. \nWe PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward, in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-cropped now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION. \nINT. COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY \nA lavish room. Filled with photographs of important people shaking hands, receiving awards, etc. COMMISSIONER WILLIAM RUDDY, a middle-aged, balding, and yes, ruddy-faced man, is here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOMMISSIONER RUDDY We're all very sorry about your father--he was a great man. \nBOBBY GREEN Thank you, sir. I'm gonna try and do my part too, now. \nCOMMISSIONER RUDDY Good.   Raise your right hand. \nRuddy leads him to the corner of the office. Bobby is guided into position as: the Commissioner picks up a small, leather-bound black book. With one hand, he holds the Bible upon which Bobby places his hand. With the other, he holds a manual, off which he reads an oath: \nCOMMISSIONER RUDDY (CONT'D) \"I hereby pledge and declare...\" \nBobby repeats after him. (This process continues until the entire PLEDGE IS COMPLETED.) \nBOBBY GREEN \"I, Robert Green, hereby pledge and DECLARE-- \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \nOf Bobby in the POLICE ARMORY. He is RECEIVING his GUN and his BADGE. Over this, we STILL HEAR: \nBOBBY GREEN \"--that I will support and defend the Constitution, both of the United States government and the State of New York, to the best of my ability...\" \nINT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY \nHe walks down the hall, with his back to us. \nBOBBY GREEN \"...I will faithfully discharge my duties in the rank of rider in the New York City Police Department. So help me God.\" \nBACK TO THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE \nRuddy and Giavannis shake Bobby's hand vigorously: \n(CONTINUED) \nBobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain him delicately (\"C'mon, calm down\"), but Bobby is in no mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything else, and it is messy, tough: \nBOBBY GREEN DON'T--FUCKIN'-- \nBobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in a rage. Then, sarcastic: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Go `head!   Keep me in here--KEEP ME HERE! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGUARD'S VOICE (MUFFLED) Bobby, we don't wanna have to put you in restraints, so just calm down! (BEAT) Calm the fuck down! \nBobby stares at the door. \nBOBBY GREEN You gonna keep me here? HUH?!? \nStill in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to: \nINT. BEDROOM \nWhere he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck. BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs. \nIt is as though all of the emotions in our story find their outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining feeling drain from him until he has nothing left. \nAfter this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head... \nWe PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING: \nINT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH \nA noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door. Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then: \nA MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER) Hello? \nA BEAT.   Bobby collects himself.    Then: \nBOBBY GREEN It's me, Lou. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) HEY!!!!   Bobkes!!! How you doin'?! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN I'm okay. Listen uh, you ain't spoke to Rosario lately, have you? \nLOUIS FALSETTI No. She's holed up with you, ain't she?--God knows where. \nBOBBY   GREEN Yeah--it's just, she   must've gone out for a little bit   and...I wanted to get in touch with   her. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Well, I talk to her, I'll tell her you called. \nBOBBY GREEN Thanks... You know, things are really changing on my end. I ain't gonna be in protection anymore. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) Oh Bob! That's great! Whaddaya say we knock back a few in your Dad's memory tonight? \nBOBBY GREEN ...I, I don't know... \nLOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER) Come on! El Caribe's got their masquerade party--every third drink's free. Be like old times! (BEAT) I'll be there--what more could ask for! C'mon! You comin'? Huh? (BEAT) You gonna be a man or not? \nANGLE on BOBBY as we GO TO: \nINT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nA SHOW is about to go on. The place has a darker quality to it now, and many patrons are wearing HALLOWEEN MASKS. BOBBY ENTERS, approaches a table in the back, where seated are Louis and Louis' girlfriend, HAZEL. Lou is armed with a huge grin, and he stands and hugs Bobby: \nLOUIS FALSETTI My brother!   The Grand Return! \nAs they sit, Lou notices Bobby is alone: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) You ain't heard from Rosario yet? \nBOBBY GREEN No... \nLOUIS FALSETTI (moves closer) You want Hazel here to fix you up with a little something? I'm only kiddin'--let's have a drink-- (to a waitress) Hey Natasha, over there! \nHAZEL Why don't you slow down a little? You're already acting stupid! \nLOUIS FALSETTI And you're already acting like a pain in my ass! I can hold my liquor and yours! \nBOBBY GREEN Jumbo, I don't want nothing right now--don't worry about it. \nJUST THEN, THE HOUSE LIGHTS DIM.    A SPOTLIGHT on the STAGE. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV ambles up to the microphone with some difficulty. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Good evening. My name is Marat Buzhayev, and I'm the owner of the El Caribe. We have a special night, tonight--the Odessa Dance Troop is here to perform for us. I know you'll enjoy it. \nAPPLAUSE.    Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) We also have an old friend who's come back to us--I want him to stand--Bobby? Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to be our manager here... \nMORE APPLAUSE. THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits. The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his introduction (\"Enjoy the show! \n(CONTINUED) \nSIRENS. A GUN BATTLE. The LOOKOUT with the AK-47 is hit-- fatally. Bobby SEES several people FLEEING out a back entrance toward another section of the weeds. Joseph remains in the grass, his head down, his hands on his head. We cannot SEE his face... \nINT. ABANDONED BATHROOM STRUCTURE \nVadim Nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching FORCE he sees through the window. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMoving with tremendous speed, he begins to light the FURS on FIRE... SMOKE... Vadim BEGINS TO COUGH, taking a suitcase of money with him. He backs out of the STRUCTURE. \nEXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD \nBILIOUS CLOUDS OF SMOKE.     BOBBY is MOVING TOWARD THE BUILDING. \nVADIM SCURRIES INTO THE WEEDS... THE SMALL STRUCTURE REALLY STARTS TO BURN. It is an odd flame, BLUE and SILENT. \nBOBBY RUNS OFF, into THE WEEDS, following VADIM. ELI CHARGES TOWARD HIS CAR. JACK is RIGHT BEHIND HIM: \nJACK SHAPIRO Stop!   Halt! \nJack ruthlessly pumps Eli full of bullets, and the man falls down dead. Jack approaches, mercilessly FIRES ANOTHER SHOT into the corpse... \nINT. WEEDS \nThe WIND HOWLS... Tall, tawny-colored weeds, marsh. BOBBY moves through the DENSE WEED GROWTH. Pushing his way through the brown plants. \nWe HEAR POLICE DOGS. BOBBY starts THRASHING. The CAMERA is HAND-HELD, MOVING TO AND FRO WITH FEROCIOUS and VERTIGINOUS SPEED. ANGLE ON BOBBY as we: \nFLASH CUT TO: \nINT. CAR - IN THE RAIN \nIt is Bobby, SEEING, through the WET GLASS: BURT, AS HE IS SHOT. DURING THE CHASE IN THE RAIN. We GO BACK TO: \nEXT. WEEDS \nBobby raises his shotgun as he RACES THROUGH THE PHRAGMITES GRASS. The WEEDS PART. It is TRICKY. HEAVY BREATHING. BOBBY SEES other MEN running through the weeds, but he can't tell who's who. CONFUSION... \nBOBBY STOPS. FEET CRUSHING THE TWIGS... A GUNSHOT, FROM WHERE, GOD ONLY KNOWS... A RUSH OF IMAGES--SHADOWED FIGURES, OBSCURED BY THE WEEDS, APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR LIKE PHANTOMS... \nBOBBY'S HEARTBEAT THUMPS ON THE SOUNDTRACK... A MAN backing up toward him; each man has his back to the other... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY DOESN'T SEE HIM YET. BUT WE CAN. THE CAMERA ZOOMS INTO BOBBY, WITH THE FIGURE BEHIND HIM. BOBBY SEES THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND. He turns, SLOWLY...raises his weapon, about to FIRE when he realizes: \nIt's MICHAEL SOLO, who, in profile to Bobby is unaware he's almost been killed. He stops when he feels the barrel of Bobby's shotgun against his ribs. SLOWLY TURNING AROUND, he sees BOBBY. WHISPERED: \nMICHAEL SOLO This's too dangerous. We'll all wind up killing each other-- \nBOBBY GREEN Vadim is in here with us. Radio our guys, tell `em to get into the clearing. \nALL OF A SUDDEN, we HEAR, SHOUTED: \nMAN'S VOICE Bobby!   We got the old man! \nBobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio (\"Our guys, outta the brush!\") Bobby starts to back up, toward the clearing... \nEXT. CLEARING \nBobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack APPROACHES: \nJACK SHAPIRO We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up by the cars. His grandkids are safe--they're in the van. \nBobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER: \nBOBBY GREEN Are all our guys out? \nThe Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward the weeds and says: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Burn it. \nSEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAll the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to emerge from the now-burning brush. \nTWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO GO IN. \nMICHAEL SOLO Bobby?   What're you doin'-- \nBOBBY GREEN I'm not gonna let him get away... \nAS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE FIRE... \nINT. FIERY WEEDS \nBobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to right... \nCHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND... BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING... JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE... \nThen he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY, AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING... SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING... \nA GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE, WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT. \n", "test1_input": "WE OWN THE NIGHT \nWritten by \nJames Gray \nFADE IN: \nA PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY... THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME. \nMILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN. \nSUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH: \nNew York, New York.   1988. \nA new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in recent memory. \nThe old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic groups rise up to seize control without respect for traditional rules of engagement. \nOutmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month... \nThe WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S \"ROCK THE CASBAH\"... SMASH CUT TO: \nCLOSE ON: BOBBY GREEN, thirty. He is passionate and vital and handsome, a real physical presence. His CLOTHES are stylish, expensive. A sly SMILE. He steps forward, into: \nINT. STOREROOM \nThe camera MOVES with him to SEE: ROSARIO DIAZ, twenties, dark-skinned, impossibly gorgeous. Leaning up against the wall, biting her lower lip, eyeing Bobby with true desire. \nBOBBY GREEN ...you're so fuckin' beautiful, you know that...? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe beams. They kiss, PASSIONATELY. SUPERIMPOSE: \"BROOKLYN\". They really GO AT IT. They are ferocious; as they DEVOUR each other: \nROSARIO DIAZ I love you, baby... \nThen we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR, a MUFFLED VOICE: \nMUFFLED VOICE Bobby!   You in there? \nNo ANSWER--they're too busy making out. Then, MORE BANGING. They both START LAUGHING. The voice continues: \nMUFFLED VOICE (CONT'D) Bobby! [If] you two could just keep your hands off each other for a second--I, I think we got a situation brewin' out front! \nROSARIO DIAZ It's Jumbo... We gotta go anyway... \nBOBBY GREEN (beat; to the door) I'll be out in a second, Louis! \nShe grabs him; he moves back in, starts MAULING her again. She SLIDES DOWN his body, perhaps to perform fellatio... \nCUT TO: \nINT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM \nA huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent, pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area, straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him, fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club. Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his name. He is having a blast. \nBobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch. He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S \"HEART OF GLASS.\" Bobby waves hello to people, greets them (\"Hey, baby!\"), a pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt, claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN. WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table, surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne- scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men, PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them. \nNEAR THE COAT CHECK \nRosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats, slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets. Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the DRUG TRADE. \nINT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY \nA HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI, forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says \"SECURITY\" on it. He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio: \nBOBBY GREEN What the fuck's goin' on in here? \nBobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON, puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend, watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control: \nLOUIS FALSETTI Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got everything under control here--so uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take my break! \nBOBBY GREEN Yeah--just keep that wide load of yours outta trouble, arright? \nLOUIS FALSETTI Yes, your fuckin' majesty! \nThe Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN What're you doing?!? You gotta behave yourself here! \nGives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap. Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who hurls his guy out of frame): \nBLOODIED PATRON C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do nothing! \nBOBBY GREEN Well now you're gonna do nothing someplace else! (louder, to all fighters; pointing:) Now listen--one of these days I'm gonna run this whole block, and I see any you in here again--any you-- I'll bust your fuckin' hole! (to Freddie) Throw `em out on their ass. I gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys with the old man. \n", "test1_true": "Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair. \nINT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM \nAn ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them. Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in. \nWe HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old, kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife, KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV Bobby!   Come here! \nBOBBY GREEN Mr. Buzhayev, how are you! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. The two EMBRACE WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly, amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment. \nKALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) So beautiful!   Beautiful! \nBobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention. Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table: \nBOBBY GREEN Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do something right now. But don't worry--everything's in good shape downstairs. \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (warm, gentle) Yes, good. You take care of things good for us... \nMarat smiles.    Then, as Bobby stands: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D) Next week, you come by--we talk. Okay? We talk about plans for you. \nBobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries to give him a small care package of food. He politely refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in Russian (\"He said he didn't want any food, and you keep trying to give it to him!\") breaks out between the old husband and his wife. As Bobby exits: \nKALINA BUZHAYEV (broken English) Bobby! Where you run off to?!? \nEXT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - SUMMER EVENING \nA modern church. A big crowd in front, made up of POLICE. We HEAR MUSIC. CLOSE SHOT of a black outdoor sign, behind glass. \"OUR LADY, QUEEN OF MARTYRS CHURCH, QUEENS, NY\". TILT DOWN: WHITE PRESS-ON letters CROOKEDLY spelling out \"NYPD PULASKI SOCIETY MTG. - 7 PM\". SUPERIMPOSE: \"QUEENS\". \nINT. QUEENS CATHEDRAL - BASEMENT \nThe MUSIC explodes down here. A large room with columns. Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men, women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMany are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW YORK. A SIGN READS: \"CONGRATULATIONS! TO `CAPTAIN JOSEPH GRUSINSKY'\". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables, piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer. \nMany COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT, GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken: \nANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their older infant, TEDDY. \nNEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex- military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king. \nStanding behind Burt are his two closest associates: MICHAEL SOLO (\"G.Q.\"), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK SHAPIRO (\"Pudge\"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph: \nBURT GRUSINSKY Here, take another one! Get another! \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Pop, they got enough! What're you doin'?!? \nBURT GRUSINSKY (in Joseph's ear) You want your face out there--it's good exposure. The PC's gonna see this. (to the Photographer) C'mon. With both kids. \nFLASH! \nPHOTOGRAPHER Thanks, Chief! \nBurt waves to the Photographer, then leans again into Joseph's ear. Still wearing a smile for the outside world: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBURT GRUSINSKY You see your brother yet? \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY (shakes head; then) He ain't gonna come. \nBURT GRUSINSKY (frowns; then:) He better. \nINT. CAR - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH \nA CLOSEUP of ROSARIO.    Beat.   Then: \nROSARIO DIAZ C'mon. What's the big deal anyway? We'll go in, you say hello, then we'll go. \nBobby seems reluctant.   Then: \nBOBBY GREEN You remember what I tol' you? \nROSARIO DIAZ Yeah!   Course! \nBOBBY GREEN Nobody knows about my father and my brother--not even Jumbo. And it's gotta stay that way, you understand? \nROSARIO DIAZ Yeah, you tol' me a thousand times. But I been with you for two years, Bobby--I should meet `em by now. We goin' in or not? \nANGLE ON BOBBY as we go to: \nINT. CHURCH STAIRWELL \n", "test2_input": "SANDRA GRUSINSKY It's okay. \nBobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to read his mind, speaks: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONT'D) He's alone. Your father just left for the precinct. \nBobby nods subtly, mouths a \"THANK YOU.\" The Guards step aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS: \nINT. WARD \nJoseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward. \nSlowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN. \nIt is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand. Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden: \nNURSE Sir...? \nJoseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking OUTPOURING of FEELING from him. \nHe leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead: \nNURSE (CONT'D) Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting hours are over. \nHe waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO: \nINT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY \nA loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE. \nBobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught. He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino teens smoking CRACK. \nHe goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBehind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is clearly Rosario's mother.) \nINT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER \nRosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then, barely audible, his voice cracking: \nBOBBY GREEN ...Feels like it was my fault... \nHe sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach. She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head. \nShe shakes her head to reassure him, whispering \"no...no...\". In this moment, he needs her. In this moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT \nAcross from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine. Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show--as usual: \nLOUIS FALSETTI Where'd you run off to, like a Jew? You got outta there, it became like a real zoo. The spics-- (looks to Rosario) `Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and I'm keepin' everybody in line. I'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm fuckin' bustin' heads-- \nHe gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible. Accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check. \nLOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D) Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that. \nBobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOBBY GREEN Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check. \nLOUIS FALSETTI Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what I did. \nLouis smiles, walks off.    Scoops up the tip from a nearby table. \nBOBBY GREEN Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago. \nROSARIO DIAZ I ain't ever gonna say nothing! I just thought...maybe he could cheer you up a little. \nBobby kisses her atop her head. JUST THEN: VADIM AND HIS GANG enter the establishment. They create a ruckus. Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Hey, look who's here! \nROSARIO DIAZ Hey Vadim... (as Vadim approaches) We were just gettin' something to eat. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (nods; to Bobby:) You make it through that bust okay? \nBobby gives a simple nod as well. Inside, Bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident: \nBOBBY GREEN I didn't have nothing on me. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Glad to hear it. \nWithout making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then: \nBOBBY GREEN Your uncle's got some problems now, though. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \n", "test2_true": "BOBBY GREEN (to Rosario) Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip. \nROSARIO DIAZ `Kay... \nRosario leaves the table.    Two GIRLS walk by: \nGIRL Hi, Bobby! \nBobby nods to them.    Vadim watches them walk away.   Then: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI You know-- (moves closer; WHISPERED:) I still got my shit coming in. Some of us think you could help get it out there. \nBOBBY GREEN It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think? \nVADIM NEZHINSKI We got a lot of muscle behind us. Lotta muscle. \nThe brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby. He looks up, begins to focus. Incredulous. Softly, as the camera ZOOMS INTO a CLOSE ANGLE on BOBBY: \nBOBBY GREEN Muscle--? \nVADIM NEZHINSKI That's right. \nBOBBY GREEN A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that. \nAnother member of the gang speaks up: Pavel: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nPAVEL LUBYARSKY Police are a fuckin' joke, dude-- the Mickey Mouse ain't gonna do nothing. \nPavel LAUGHS, and Bobby looks at him with real resentment. Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down elsewhere. Vadim pulls up a chair. Sits down. Intimate: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI Bobby, those cops--they, they ain't no problem. \nVadim turns over his hand.   A SPIDER WEB TATTOO graces the palm of his right hand: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (CONT'D) You see this? I got this on the inside, at Tchita. You earn these. (QUIET) So don't worry--we'll get `em all. Cut off the head, the body'll fall, right? You keep on doin' it `til they get the message. (even quieter) We got all their names. On a list. \nVadim leans back in his chair. Bobby's eyes widen. Vadim makes a \"POP\" sound. Bobby tries to hide his shock. Vadim grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it. \nVADIM NEZHINSKI CONT'D) Just think about it. You change your mind, you call Pavel. \nBOBBY GREEN (nods; then) I'll see you around... \nAnd the men move to another table. Bobby looks at Rosario and Louis, who're standing by the register. They turn back to Bobby and SMILE, totally unaware of the conversation that's just taken place. CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY as we GO TO: \nEXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO \nIt's a huge municipal structure.   Bobby bolts inside. \nINT. POLICE SERVICE AREA TWO - ENTRANCE \nThe place is hopping, with police everywhere. Almost like a fraternity house. BOBBY CHARGES IN, looks around. Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSERGEANT PROVENZANO, forties, rings a SILVER BELL, which is engraved with the words, \"Homicide Bell.\" The room quiets down. Provenzano holds up his hands. Grinning: \nSERGEANT PROVENZANO Everybody! Our little \"A\" House got another coupla stiffs today, so it's time for another poem! (catcalls; reads from a pad) \"The people of Brooklyn have been volleyed and thundered; at last the number slaughtered has reached one hundred!\" \nAPPLAUSE. Provenzano bows.        BOBBY shoves his way through the crowd. Urgently: \nBOBBY GREEN I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky. \nSERGEANT PROVENZANO Oh, uh, he's on the second floor, I think. In the muster room. \nEXT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HALLWAY \nBobby looks down the hall.       He SEES his father, talking to a CROWD of UNIFORMED COPS.       Burt sees him, keeps talking. Bobby touches his arm. \nBOBBY GREEN Pop, I gotta talk to you. \nBURT GRUSINSKY I'm working. \nBOBBY GREEN It's important--I got information. \nBobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the two of them are out of earshot of others. Forcefully: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) It's about you. \nBurt is surprised.       His attention sharpens: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) It's bad. \nBurt realizes the severity.       Then we HEAR: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMICHAEL SOLO (O.S.) Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me! \nINT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - MUSTER ROOM \n", "test3_input": "EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING \nAn American sedan, a DARK BLUE car, pulls up to the building. A man gets out--we can't quite tell who it is yet... \nINT. DARK AND DIRTY HALLWAY - ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING \nA young AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE stands in a doorway, dressed in a green parka. The hall, covered with trash and graffiti, is illuminated by a solitary light bulb. He guards ANOTHER SHOOTING GALLERY, which is in the room right behind him. \nFOOTSTEPS. The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE is on guard. The MAN emerges from the darkness, his back STILL TO US. Upon seeing him, the African-American Man smiles, reaches into his pocket. Hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope: \nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN I got your money man, but my shit's running low. When you get me more? \nMAN'S VOICE (SLIGHT ACCENT) (as he counts the $) Just hold on a little while longer-- we get more for you soon. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN Yeah?   When's that gonna be? \nMAN'S VOICE Tomorrow. \nWe CUT TO the over-the-shoulder of the man, and leaning out of the DARKNESS and into the LIGHT: ELI MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law. He continues: \nELI MIRICHENKO After tomorrow, everybody's gonna get well. \nThe African-American Man nods. Satisfied with the cash, Eli turns around, walks back down the hallway. ANGLE BACK ON AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN as the camera zooms past him, into: \nINT. SHOOTING GALLERY \nIn the darkness, among the addicts: BOBBY GREEN. His face illuminated only by the sliver of light from the crack in the door. He's witnessed the whole thing... We HEAR: \nCOP'S VOICE (O.S.) We got your boy Eli completely covered, Bobby. \nINT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe group is all together. Cops we don't know pack the room, standing around the table. Seated at the table: Michael, Jack, Bobby, and at the head, Joseph. A TOUGH- LOOKING COP we've seen before but not met: \nTOUGH-LOOKING COP He just turned in for the night. (BEAT) Can't move an inch without us up his ass. \nBOBBY GREEN Well, he said tomorrow and that's what matters. \nTOUGH-LOOKING COP And we'll be right there with him-- you can be sure of that. \nMICHAEL SOLO They're movin' serious weight, we might be talkin' major league firepower. Maybe we call in the Feds. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJACK SHAPIRO The Feds? \nMICHAEL SOLO Each one of `em's got 25 years on the job with this kinda thing, Pudge. \nBOBBY GREEN They got one year of experience, repeated 25 times. \nEVERYONE LAUGHS.     Bobby turns to Joseph: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Pop would never bring `em in, Joe. We gotta see this through ourselves... \nJACK SHAPIRO Bobby's right. \nJoseph's back stiffens.       With resolve: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah, definitely... We'll get the TAC plan together... (INTENSE) And wherever it is, we'll be ready for `em... \nMICHAEL SOLO Arright, guys.    That's it for now. \nThe troops get up to leave.      Jack approaches Joseph. SOTTO: \nJACK SHAPIRO JOE-- \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY Yeah? \nBobby looks at Jack--who leans in, to Joseph's ear: \nJACK SHAPIRO You know, they're laughin' at us, out there on the street. Now when we get there, it'll be up to you what we do. But I hope you think about droppin' the hammer on `em. \nJoseph contemplates this briefly, then Jack pulls him CLOSER: (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJACK SHAPIRO (CONT'D) I mean--after your father and everything? These people're like fuckin' lice. (BEAT) Just think about what I'm saying to you. \nBobby senses the pressure being placed upon his brother, and he moves Jack away from Joseph: \nBOBBY GREEN All right, c'mon. Enough... \nANGLE ON BOBBY, JOSEPH as we GO TO: \nEXT. FLOYD BENNETT FIELD - LATE NIGHT/DAWN \nSERIES OF SHOTS of: \n1. WIDE SHOT of A MARSH AREA, with tall wheatlike weed growth that is extremely dense. \n2. MEDIUM SHOT of a STRUCTURE, in the middle of this. An old, small, abandoned stone building, built as a WPA project in the 1930's. It is a men's/ladies' bathroom, probably a Robert Moses project, but long since abandoned. \n3. WIDE SHOT of the STRUCTURE. The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN, from high above the STONE BUILDING, and PANS to REVEAL the TALL WEEDS AROUND IT. \n4. MEDIUM SHOT of ELI'S DARK BLUE AUTOMOBILE, arriving. Eli emerges from the car. A bodyguard behind him, armed with an AK-47. He prepares to GREET: \n", "test3_true": "Out steps: A HOST of men in suits, grasping suitcases-- presumably filled with money. \nTHEN ANOTHER TOWN CAR.    And yet ANOTHER. \nThe men all congregate like it's a legal business transaction. HANDSHAKES, SMILES. \nWe PAN AROUND, MOVING THROUGH THE WEEDS NOW. And we SEE: Bobby and Joseph, as they arrive, MOVE INTO POSITION. The camera MOVES LATERALLY and we SEE: Michael and Jack and other COPS, doing much the same. All carrying SHOTGUNS. One COP POINTS A SHOTGUN MICROPHONE at the ACTIVITY, and our guys can HEAR perp conversations in their EARPIECES... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANOTHER CAR ARRIVES. APPEARING out of it is VADIM NEZHINSKI. Joseph bristles at the sight of him. Bobby grabs his brother's arm, squeezes: \nBOBBY GREEN We're gonna get all of `em today. \nJUST AT THAT MOMENT, a WHITE VAN PULLS UP: two men get out. They open the back, FILLED WITH FURS. They take a number of coats out of the BACK OF THE VAN, bring them to the shack... \nALL THE COPS appear confused. What the hell is this? ANOTHER TOWN CAR. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand around the auto. Helping someone out of the vehicle. Whoever this is, he's the EMPEROR... \nEMERGING: MARAT BUZHAYEV. Stepping up behind him, Eli, helping King Marat. MARAT and VADIM greet each other. They KISS WARMLY. ANGLE ON BOBBY. A beat. We SEE the devastation. Almost to himself: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Lookit the two of them...they're so fuckin' close... \nThen the cops spot: TWO YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, sitting in the back of the car. They do not get out. They seem clueless. \nSTANDING GUARD over all of this is a LOOKOUT, who is armed with an AK-47. Several other ARMED MEN take positions closer to the structure as the FURS ARE BROUGHT IN. \nBUSINESSMEN make some banter, then enter the shack--led by NEZHINSKI. MARAT BUZHAYEV and ELI follow him in. Many other men pour into the structure, BRIEFCASES in hand. \nMICHAEL SOLO Okay--when they complete the sale, that's when we move. ESU'll grab the kids. \nA TRANSACTION BEGINS inside the shack, and the COPS are WATCHING. They SEE the action through BROKEN WINDOWS... \nINT. SHACK \nNEZHINSKI and MARAT, with the Businessmen. He looks behind him, to MARAT, who steps forward. In Russian: \nMARAT BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) This's what we've been planning for for so long. My nephew has stayed just to see this through. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MARAT BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE) When this is done, we'll control almost the whole market. (motions to Man) Each load is completely untraceable. It's my own method. \nThe Man places a FUR on a distressed countertop.    Rips it apart. Nezhinski steps forward: \nVADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE) The rest of the product is in the van--total weight, 75 kilos. \nPlaces one of the lengths of fur into: A BASIN filled with fluid... The CAMERA ZOOMS into A CLOSE SHOT on the FUR in that basin... \nThe FUR IS POKED a COUPLE OF TIMES. A beat. Then: WHITE PLUMES RISE from the coat's fabric to the top of the liquid, and Eli begins to skim the substance off the surface. \nDUMPING OUT   some of the substance (now in crystalline form) onto a pad,   MARAT BUZHAYEV hands it to a BUSINESSMAN, who TASTES it.    THE BUSINESSMAN nods, pleased with his product...    He reaches for a SUITCASE. It is OPENED. Filled with   MONEY. \nEXT. FIELD \nBobby and Joseph.    Joseph has his earpiece, HEARS.     Then: \nJOSEPH GRUSINSKY The deal's closing--let's go! \nBobby gets up, out of the weeds, SHOTGUN aimed: \nBOBBY GREEN You're surrounded by the police! Come out now, with your hands on your heads! \nINT. ABANDONED STRUCTURE \nVadim and Marat SNAP TO ATTENTION. SHOCKED. RUSSIAN WORDS ARE EXCHANGED, and everyone starts to PANIC... \nEXT. FIELD \nThe COPS begin the assault, EXPLODING FROM EVERYWHERE. SIRENS, the whole thing. Bobby and Joseph get up, stand into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure. A GROUP OF ESU COPS charge MARAT'S CAR, GOING FOR THE CHILDREN--who watch this with fear and incomprehension... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn ARMED GUARD, standing outside the shack, begins to fire at the cops. EVERYONE OPENS FIRE. \nALL OF A SUDDEN: A COP, that TOUGH-LOOKING COP we saw at Joseph's house but a few moments earlier, is HIT by the Armed Guard's fire. HIT IN THE FACE, he falls down near Joseph and Bobby. DEAD, his visage a bloodied pulp. \nCLOSE SHOT ON JOSEPH. HE FREEZES. We momentarily FLASH CUT back to his OWN SHOOTING... He cannot bear reliving the terror of his moment... \nAs the COPS move in: Bobby spins around to look for his brother. He finds him still on the ground. Joseph seems unable to move, holding onto his shotgun for dear life: \nBOBBY GREEN Joe?! \nJoseph looks at his brother, shakes his head. Completely shattered in the moment. STILL. SHOTS RING OUT. Bobby pushes his brother down on the ground. In his ear: \nBOBBY GREEN (CONT'D) Arright, just stay down! \nChaos begins. All of the men inside the small building have aimed their guns into the WEEDS. But instead of stopping because of the shooting, Bobby progresses inexorably toward the structure, his shotgun poised to fire. \nNOW MICHAEL and JACK and OTHER MEMBERS of the NARCOTICS TEAMS come out of the WEEDS. THEY FIRE their WEAPONS. \nMARAT'S GRANDCHILDREN are DRAGGED OUT OF THE CAR, CRYING LOUDLY... \nFIFTY YARDS AWAY \nA LINE of UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS forms. They move in unison. Seems like a hundred men. Bobby and Jack and some of his men are coming from one side, the line from another. \n"}

NURSE Cut that out, you little spit, 
18 TNT. CORRIDOR Archie stops to hear what the woman has to say. 
WOMAN About the bill, Doctor. Barney is passing by. 
ARCHIE Is she okay? 
BARNEY 
(DARKLY) Lunch. Archie looks up at the woman. 
â¢ ARCHIE His leg will be fine. Don't worry too much about the bill. Just enough to pay it. 
WOMAN I have money to pay it, A pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually dressed group past Archie and the woman. 
PUBLIC RELATIONS MAN Yea, we had ABC filming a documentary here last week 
19 INT. THE ROARING 20'S CAFE DAY 
All through the scene Barney and Archie will be served by topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide down a big brass pole in the centre of the room. As the scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned beef sandwich. Now Archie appears, threading his way through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone, as the topless models majestically move about.

ANNOUNCER (no fashion cliche untouched) Springtime in Paree. Our elegante dinner pajamas. In airy aquamarine chiffon and Mediterranean blue peau de soie. Delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the Palace of Versailles. 
BARNEY "Screw you, Wilma." Why didn't you tell me? 
ARCHIE How is she? 
BARNEY You tell me. 
ARCHIE Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it. Terrific. And her rib? 
BARNEY I taped it. Gave her some seconal. â¢ Should have a vertical just to be safe. A waitress hovers 
ARCHIE Why do we have to eat topless? 
BARNEY The best Irish stew in town. He is eating a corned beef sandwich. Archie is ordering the same. 
BARNEY She said you beat her up. Kidding, of course. Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm. Breasts with their pasties always intrude. 
BARNEY You must have been a little rough on her, daddy.

19 CONTINUED The second model, a beautiful topless Negress, is now wandering past the tables. The announcer goes on and on. 
ANNOUNCER Opening Night at the Opera. Though the curtain has risen on the first act of Aida, all eyes are on the Royal Box, Mi Lady in dazzling velvet: Cardinal Richelieu Rouge. The utter simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon. Archie eats his sandwich. An off-duty topless waitress sits in the corner having lunch, holding a napkin over her bosom with one hand, while eating with the other. 
BARNEY Archie ? 
ARCHIE Barney ? 
BARNEY 
(UNEASILY) You know how long I've known you? 
ARCHIE Forever? 
BARNEY That's how long. And Polo and the kids. That's exactly how long. Another silence. Archie is watching the brass pole. Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia. Archie accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure. Barney will not be stopped.

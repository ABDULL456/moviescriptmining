{"train": "BLACK PUSHER Man, I'm clean. \nDOYLE You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean? \nRUSSO Who stuck up the laundromat? \nDOYLE How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie? \nThe BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for relief from the pressure of the inquisition. \nRUSSO (in pain) You better give me the guy who got the old Jew or you better give me something or you're just a memory in this town. \nBLACK PUSHER That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do nothin'. \nThe BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion and fear. \nDOYLE You put a shiv in my partner.  Know what that means?

HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT \nDOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained bandage on the left forearm. \nDOYLE Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea. \nRUSSO How'd I know he had a knife. \nDOYLE Never trust a nigger. \nRUSSO He coulda been white. \nDOYLE Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick? \nRUSSO Not a chance. \nRUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is part of the inventory. \nDOYLE Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks. \nRUSSO Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat. \nDOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause, sticks one in RUSSO's mouth. \nDOYLE Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say? \nRUSSO Drink this. \nDOYLE Whip it out. \nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT \nTHE TITLES COMMENCE \nTHE FRENCH CONNECTION \nTitles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says \"Cinzano.\" DOYLE turns and says \"Two of these.\" DOYLE slips into the chair opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him, why they are there. \nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT \nA long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that emanate from the same large table. \nDOYLE I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too. \nRUSSO Hey, I thought we come for a drink. \nINT.

He glances over his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car. \nClose of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York. \nClose rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights, can be seen in the background walking around the cars, across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway. \nMedium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into the doorway. \nINT.

He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.

BAR ROOM - DAY \nThe Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO. There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy with conversation, laughter and music. \nDOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt, under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the bar. \nDOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence. \nDOYLE Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here! \nTwenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle- taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of the customers doesn't. \nDOYLE What's my name? \n1ST MAN Doyle. \nDOYLE What? \n1ST MAN Mr. Doyle. \nDOYLE Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie? \n1ST MAN What? \nDOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar, running the length of it. \nClose of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the customers. \nClose shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking into it. \nClose shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on the bar. \nThen, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled with tomato juice. \nDOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours the mixture into the ashcan. \nDOYLE Milk shake anyone? \nHe wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to step forward.  The MEN do not move at first. \nDOYLE Move ass when I tell you. \nThey move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN. \nDOYLE Put it on the bar. \nHands of the THREE MEN going into pockets. \nClose of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates. \nDOYLE (collecting the works) All right, you three clowns step into those phone booths, you're goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there till I'm ready for you. \nThe three men turn and enter the individual phone booths. They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question. \nDOYLE Everybody goes when the whistle blows. \nRUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of works. \nRUSSO What's your story? \nDANCER Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.

Everybody going to get well. \nDOYLE Who brings it? \n2ND MAN Who knows? \nDOYLE Where do you want it? \n2ND MAN This side. \nDoor of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides that would be futile too. \nDOYLE I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass. \nRUSSO Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour. \nDOYLE (to all) We're goin' now!  Goodbye. \nEXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY \nClose shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background, being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.

You're not supposed to be in Ridgewood. \nDOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON \nDOYLE Detach us.  Let us have a shot at it, at least until we see if there's anything here or not. Everybody wants Weinstock, right? So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve it. \nSIMONSON You couldn't burn a three-time loser with what you're bringing in here.  You know you stiffs could run yourselves an entrapment rap. The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn is full of Candy Store guys with two cars who like to go to nightclubs. \nCHARNIER (V.O.) Allo... Salvatore... \nSAL (V.O.) Who's this -- \nCHARNIER (V.O.) ... Salvatore?... \nRUSSO enters with a bag of sandwiches and cigarettes.  DOYLE waves him to the phone. \nSAL (V.O.)

It must be some kind of fast-draw gimmick or something. \nRUSSO Knock it off, Bill. \nMULDERIG He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're gonna lose him. \nDOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.

Well, if you can't do better than that, you can stick the cups. \nEXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY \nHIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty other men are walking around, looking at the cars. \nA POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers gather around the auction trailer in the b.g. \nLA VALLE There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month. \nMARIE Just for mistakes of parking? \nLA VALLE No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier. \nMARIE (off camera) Darling, may I have this one? \nMedium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD. \nMARIE It looks so lonesome here. \nCHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her. \nCHARNIER It would look even more lonesome in our garage. \nINT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY \nWithin the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear. At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old. All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back. \nAUCTIONEER Every car sold today must be removed at the purchaser's own expense.  We have no keys or anything to start the vehicles with. You buy 'em as you see 'em and where you see 'em.  All right, the first car offered is Number 24398. A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear fifteen dollars? \nThe bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill of sale. \nAUCTIONEER We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars? \nLA VALLE (aside to CHARNIER) Notice he will never mention the year of the car. \nAUCTIONEER I got a fifteen dollar bid going... Do I hear anymore... Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen? Twenty... Twenty-three... Anymore... Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once -- Do I hear twenty-eight... All right, last call for twenty- five... \nClose shot of CHARNIER \nCHARNIER (aside of LA VALLE) And these are the cars we're buying for shipment? \nClose shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE.  They are facing the AUCTIONEER. \nLA VALLE Yes, sir.  That man in the dark jacket is our buyer. \nClose shot of THE BUYER, LOU BOCA.  He is very active and wins the present bid. \nWIRETAP SEQUENCE \"B\" \nINT. BASEMENT \nDOYLE and RUSSO playing Gin Rummy, listening at each end of one phone - breaking up. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nShot of wire. \nANGIE (V.O.) (sleepy) Where are you? \nSAL (V.O.) Takin' care o' business, honey. \nANGIE (V.O.) Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight. \nSAL (V.O.) You know I hadda meet some people tonight -- \nANGIE (V.O.) -- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you. \nSAL (V.O.) Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night? \n", "test2_true": "SAL (V.O.) I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open. \nANGIE (V.O.) Sal -- \nSAL (V.O.) Yeah? \nANGIE (V.O.) Don't forget anchovies. (she hangs up) \nSAL (V.O.) This broad's crazy! \nEXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE BRIDGE) \nPick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE \nAs the camera plays over the bridge: (in French) \nCHARNIER (V.O.) It's beautiful. \nLA VALLE (V.O.) It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world. \nCHARNIER Who financed it? \nLA VALLE Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City. \nMARIE Why is it called Hellgate? \nLA VALLE The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here. \nCHARNIER If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list. \nLA VALLE Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it. \nCHARNIER Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful. \nLA VALLE Mmm. \nMARIE Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman. \nCHARNIER Not any woman, Marie.  Just one. \nEXT. OLD ROAD IN WARD'S ISLAND \nCHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE walking. \n(NEAR GARAGE) \nLA VALLE I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France. \n(NEAR CREMATORIUM) \nMARIE What is that old building? \nLA VALLE Oh, it's been abandoned for years. \nMARIE What was it? \nLA VALLE It was a crematorium. \nMARIE For garbage? \nLA VALLE For dead bodies. \nWIRETAP SEQUENCE \"C\" \nINT.

WESTBURY HOTEL ON MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT \nMedium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera). \nINT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT \nView from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of coffee.  He opens it between his knees and scalds his mouth with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig. \nRear close view of BILL MULDERIG at the wheel of the car, looking at DOYLE in the rear-view mirror. \nMULDERIG You about ready for a break? \nA view of MULDERIG at the wheel, RUSSO twisted around in the seat, looking back at DOYLE and putting the cap back on the bottle.  When DOYLE isn't sipping at the coffee-whiskey, he's looking out the window of the car at the entrance of the hotel.  He looks beat. \nDOYLE The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute. \nRUSSO The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up. \nMULDERIG Christ you should o' collared him right there. \nDOYLE Who's on him? \nRUSSO Phil Klein. \nDOYLE What about Sal? \nRUSSO \nRUSSO We put him to bed for the night. \nMULDERIG \nMULDERIG Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit. \nDOYLE AND MULDERIG - INTERCUT \nDOYLE (to MULDERIG) Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up. \nMULDERIG Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing. \nDOYLE Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week. \nRUSSO, close. \nRUSSO Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin' down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's while you can. \nClose shot, DOYLE. \nINT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment. \nMedium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting opposite the CHEMIST. \nSAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are interested; SAL quite nervously. \nThe CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin. \nHe pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny alcohol lamp. \nHe removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case, fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band. \nHe places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the burnmeister tube, about three inches in. \nWith a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp. \nWe watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the mineral oil and \nThe mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220\u00b0 - 230\u00b0. \nThe faces of the three men are filled with wonder and anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a cheering section, rooting the hometeam home. \nThe longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240\u00b0! \nCHEMIST Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof! Best I've ever seen!  If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing for two years on this load. \nClose on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar. \nWEINSTOCK Retail is not my end of the business. Are you telling me it's worth the half million? \nMedium close of the CHEMIST. \nCHEMIST How many kilos? \nSAL Sixty. \nCHEMIST Six kilos at eight big ones a kilo... (he nods) I'd say it should be able to take a seven to one hit in the street. \nSAL By the time it gets down to nickel bags it's at least thirty-two million! \nMedium close of WEINSTOCK and BOCA. \nWEINSTOCK Thank you, Howard.  Take what's left there with you and goodnight. \nThe CHEMIST packs his apparatus and leaves. \nSAL I guess we got a deal, eh? \nMedium close shot of WEINSTOCK alone, appraising BOCA. \nWEINSTOCK We got a test.  A deal for half a million dollars, maybe. \nSAL, whose cool is easily shattered. \nSAL Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He wants the bread and he wants to go back to France.  He ain't gonna hang around and play games.  He's one o' the shrewdest cats I ever run across. \nWEINSTOCK, close. \nWEINSTOCK What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building. \nINTERCUT SAL, WEINSTOCK \nSAL Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up. \nWEINSTOCK So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry. \nSAL I been damn careful up to now. \n", "test3_id": 1091}

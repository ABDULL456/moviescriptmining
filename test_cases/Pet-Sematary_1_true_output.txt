EXT.  THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD 
He stands there, eyes inscrutable. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE 
It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up, although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle, disgusted. 
He starts to dial a number from memory. 
JUD (voice) Louis. 
INT.  THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD 
JUD When you talk to 'em, not one word about what we done tonight. 'S'far's you know, the cat's still fine. 
INT.  LOUIS, BY THE PHONE 
After a moment he lowers it into the cradle. 
INT.  JUD 
JUD You'll understand. In the meantime, keep your peace. What we did, Louis, was a secret thing. Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart. The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis--like the soil up there in the old Micmac burying ground. A man grows what he can...and tends it. 
During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his hand on LOUIS'S shoulder. 
LOUIS But-- 
JUD No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight. 
EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH JUD 
SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then: 
DORY GOLDMAN (voice) Goldman residence. 
LOUIS Hi, Dory...it's Louis-- 
During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck. As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for tonight's piece of work. 
A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA and JUD. 
INT.  LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
He's on the phone, smiling and happy. 
RACHEL (voice) You want to talk to the birthday girl? 
LOUIS That'd be real fine. 
ELLIE (voice) Hi...daddy? 
LOUIS (sings) Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you! 
ELLIE (voice) That was awful, daddy. 
LOUIS Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland? 
ELLIE Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. 
LOUIS (grinning broadly) Way to go, Gage! 
ELLIE (voice) What? 
LOUIS I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? 
ELLIE (voice) Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and a Chatty Cathy doll... 
INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE 
She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio. 
ELLIE ...and a Garfield radio! How's Church, dad? Does he miss me? 
INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS 
The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave. 
LOUIS Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie. I haven't seen him this evening, but-- 
INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE 
RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair. 
ELLIE Well, make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he can't run out in the road and get greased. And kiss him goodnight for me. 
LOUIS (voice) Yuck! Kiss your own cat! 
ELLIE Want to talk to Gage? 
Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL encourages him to say a few words. 
INT.  THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS 
From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling. LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING 
LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in. 
EXT.  THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS 
It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat HISS. He turns. 
INT.  CHURCH, ECU 
He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming right down our throats. He's hissing angrily. 
INT.  LOUIS 
He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING NOISE. 
INT.  ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH 
He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight. 
INT.  LOUIS 
He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright. He goes to the garage door and looks out. 
LOUIS (calls) Church?

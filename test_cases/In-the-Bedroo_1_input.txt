Matt sits behind his desk catching up on some paperwork. Janelle appears in the doorway. 
JANELLE I'm going to lunch Dr. Fowler-- .alright She continues smiling as though ting to extend her tenderness. Matt avoids eye-contact. cie Leaves. Matt looks relieved. 
. GRINNEL'S CR W-S NEST - DAY Willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer in the Vietnam War. The theme, if there is one, is definitely nautical. Snapshots of longtime customers are stapled on the walls between the booths and tables, two are framed, and prominent. They are from Willis' - -, days; The first an entry photo of A YOUNG WILLIS front of the ha f. The second a sun faded color photo of : att and Willis. Both ook to be in their twenties, both dressed in Navy Whites. The trade here is mostly ve early breakfast, and then lunch for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories. 
A MUTED news show plays on a ceiling at the far end of the booths. A sign on the wall reads T your "Forget about lunch" breakfast. Willis carries over two plates with omelettes, parks them on the table, and takes a seat across from Matt. 
WILLIS Don't worry, I didn't make em. Matt takes a bite. He winces. 
WILLIS What? Oh, that's mine. He switches plates. 
WILLIS Sorry. Matt takes another bite. Better, 
WILLIS You got back to work so quick, Matt. It's not too soon? 
MATT I can't stay home. So, how's business? 
WILLIS Oh,.you know, same old crap. Got held up again, you knew that. 
MATT No. I didn't. 
WILLIS yeah...they got seventy five bucks. 
MATT Were you on the till? Willis chuckles, shakes his head. 
WILLIS They would have gotten something else if I'd been on the till. Matt nods. 
WILLIS How you doin', Matt? You on't write, you don't call. Where'd the love go? '0-' 
MATT Nag nag nag. Matt glances at an old clipping from the BOSTON GLOBE stapled to the wall. It's a photo from the 67 Redsox dream to 
Petrocelli, Yaztrems i and Reggie Smith, each hold u two fingers, they are s Â°ling after hitting consecutive omeruns. Matt remembers. Happier days. 
WILLIS They set the bail hearing yet? 
MATT Sometime in the next few days.ye , 
WI IS Are you going? 
MATT I don't ow. Davis says it's a formallity really. I haven't talked to Ruth about weather she thinks we should go or not.

WILLIS The criminal trial set yet?

WILLIS October? 
MATT That's what they tell me, anyway. 
WILLIS Christ, they take their time. 
MATT .yeah, well, he's in there now. 
WILLIS They're keeping him busy, I'm sure - You know where they'll move h once he's sentenced? Matt shifts the focus to his omelette. 
MATT You have any Tabasco sauce? Willis pauses. He looks around, ca `out to the kitc hen. 
WILLIS Hey, Pete. Tabasco. Pete! Ah, shit. He heads to the back. Matt looks out the window. A refrigera ted truck with the STROUT logo on it's side pulls to a stop at the light. Willis returns with sauce in hand. 
He takes a seat. Shifts his tone again.

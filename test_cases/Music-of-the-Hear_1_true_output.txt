Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain. Roberta moves closer to them. 
ROBERTA I'll take care of you, Nick. You too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going anywhere. We're still a family. 
Nick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts to cry and Roberta holds him too. 
ROBERTA (softly, to both) I promise. 
INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY 
Ernie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind. 
HER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast asleep. ANOTHER ANGLE - The brick workers build a crooked fireplace. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Roberta sighs heavily, then crosses to the painters. 
ROBERTA What color is this? 
PAINTER White. 
ROBERTA I told you Eggshell. 
PAINTER Eggshells are white. 
Brian watches this interaction as he sands a door. 
BRIAN You're an idiot! I told you -- you can't be your own contractor. 
ROBERTA You're right. I'm an idiot. 
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him. 
ROBERTA Wake up, Ernie. 
He looks at her groggily. 
ROBERTA You're fired. 
She crosses to the brick workers. 
ROBERTA You're fired. 
She crosses to the painters. 
ROBERTA You're fired. 
Brian smiles at her, impressed. 
BRIAN That's more like it. 
ROBERTA You're fired too. 
Brian laughs. 
ROBERTA No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be with a man who can make a commitment to me. I need that, and my sons need that. (beat) So can you? 
BRIAN (hesitates, then) Roberta -- 
His tone and expression tell her the words are not forthcoming. 
ROBERTA Get out. 
He looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't give her what she wants. He exits. Roberta stands in the middle of the room, a determined look on her face. 
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
ROBERTA 
Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin. 
ON STAGE 
The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations. Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific. 
As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a WOMAN elbows her husband: 
WOMAN That's the one Lucy wrote! 
The CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty. 
THE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE 
The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, and Roberta turns to face them. 
She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.

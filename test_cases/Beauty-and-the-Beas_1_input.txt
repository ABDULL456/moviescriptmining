JEAN Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite! 
CLOTHILDE He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free! 
GASTON So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me! 
Gaston grabs a TORCH from a villager and tosses it into a barrel of pitch. Flames rise to the sky. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride 
Gaston lights Clothilde's torch, then clasps the shoulder of Monsieur d'Arque, who watches helplessly as his asylum wagon horses are commandeered by the mob. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... KILL THE BEAST! 
Some villagers seize shovels, pitchforks, axes. Some light torches in the pitch. Others wrench a boar's head PIKE STAFF from outside the country inn. Pere Robert tries to calm the frenzy but the force of the mob pushes him back. 
MOB Light your torch, mount your horse! 
GASTON Screw your courage to the sticking place 
MOB We're counting on Gaston to lead the way 
97    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                          97 
Gaston and LeFou crash into the woods at a full gallop. 
GASTON Call it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I say 
LeFou's doubts are growing: 
LEFOU There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released 
MOB Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go! 
Gaston holds up the mirror. 
GASTON Show me the castle! 
IN THE MIRROR -- Gaston sees the hidden path to the castle. 
100   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                                100 
Plumette's head rests on Lumière's shoulder.    Mrs. Potts nuzzles Chip. 
LUMIÈRE At least he has finally learned to love. 
COGSWORTH A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return. 
MRS. POTTS No. This is the first time I've had any real hope she would. 
ANGLE ON CHIP -- he hears a distant sound -- the rumble of MARCHING BOOTS -- puzzled, he hops to the window embrasure -- 
CHIP Did you hear that, mama?    Is it her!? Is she coming back?! 
The staff and Froufrou jump up, excited, and move to the window. They see torches in the distance. 
LUMIÈRE Could it be? 
They look through the glass, distorted with frost, as the mob moves through the garden. Lumière warms the windowpane with his flame to see more clearly. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Sacrebleu!     Invaders. 
MRS. POTTS Ruffians! 
COGSWORTH Well, there you go. So much for true love. Man the barricades, and hold fast! 
They hop down from the embrasure. 
102   INT. FOYER - CASTLE - NIGHT                              102 
Lumière, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Plumette and Chapeau stand at the front door, forming a sad barricade. 
CASTLE STAFF Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle -- Unafraid although the danger just increased 
CADENZA Move aside! 
Cadenza crab-walks in from the ballroom, standing vertically and propping himself against the door. The others gather around him. 
103   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                            103 
The mob hauls their boar's head battering ram up to the door. 
MOB Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast!

INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley. 
MOVING DOWN THE HALL 
A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into... 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable to look away. 
He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC. 
IVY What're you looking at? 
Hull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude. 
IVY (continuing) You want to suck it, bitch? (offers his dick) Or drink it? 
Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't move. 
IVY (continuing; recognizing him) Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't you? 
Somebody pushes on the outside of the door. Hull holds it closed with his back. 
IVY (continuing) I gotta take care of you, too, huh? 
He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun. 
Hull is frozen. 
Ivy starts to draw it out. 
Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to the floor. Hull steps out into... 
INT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT 
An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes. 
Hull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him. 
A couple that had been making out, stops, looks. 
It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away. 
INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't know the person there. 
With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto the dresser: 
Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood- soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks up... 
PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN 
He smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix this in his thoughts. 
EXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - PAY PHONE - DAY 
Hull on the phone. He's unusually excited, even moved. 
HULL ...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy... 
INT. HULL'S HOUSE - CLEVELAND - DAY 
Carmen on the phone, jumping up and down with excitement. 
CARMEN Daddy!! 
HULL (V.O.) (through phone) Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you! 
CARMEN What? 
HULL (V.O.) I miss you... 
CARMEN (thrilled) I miss you, too, Daddy...

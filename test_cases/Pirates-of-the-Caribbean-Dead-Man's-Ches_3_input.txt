WILL TURNER Eight fives. 
DAVY JONES Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar. 
DAVY JONES And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port! 
WILL TURNER Fool. Why did you do that? 
WILL TURNER It was never about winning, or losing. 
FLYING DUTCHMAN organ room 
[nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman] 
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck] 
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand] 
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring] 
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him] 
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles] 
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones] 
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song] 
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles] 
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key] 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck 
WILL TURNER It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either. 
WILL TURNER They'll know you helped me. 
WILL TURNER I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise. 
[Will sets out alone on a longboat] 
Black Pearl 
[crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl] 
GIBBS Beckett! 
ELIZABETH SWANN Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company. 
JACK SPARROW Agh. 
GIBBS Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word. 
JACK SPARROW Agh. 
GIBBS Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that. 
JACK SPARROW Of course. He wants the chest. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Yes, he did say something about a chest. 
GIBBS If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea. 
JACK SPARROW A truly discomforting notion, love. 
GIBBS And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard! 
JACK SPARROW Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? 
ELIZABETH SWANN Persuasion. 
JACK SPARROW Friendly? 
ELIZABETH SWANN Decidedly not. 
JACK SPARROW Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.

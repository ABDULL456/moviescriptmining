INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE 
SARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something. JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up surprised to see him. 
JOHN TULD May I come in? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Please, sit. 
JOHN TULD closes the door and sits in front of her desk. Looks around, then looks right at her. 
JOHN TULD So... we are going to do this thing. 
SARAH ROBERTSON OK. 
JOHN TULD It's going to be tight. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Is Sam on board? 
JOHN TULD Not yet. 
TULD pauses. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) Sarah, I need a head to feed to these traders... and the board... this morning. 
SARAH looks up. 
(CONTINUED) 51   CONTINUED:                                                       51 
SARAH ROBERTSON Is it me or Cohen? 
JOHN TULD It's you. 
They stare at each other, she does not flinch. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this? 
JOHN TULD I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here... 
SARAH ROBERTSON (Nods) 
JOHN TULD Obviously it's quite complicated. 
SARAH ROBERTSON John I was told that in no uncertain terms... 
JOHN TULD It was all a very grey area. 
SARAH ROBERTSON It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen. 
JOHN TULD I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this... 
TULD pauses, they look at each other. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) We all fucked this one up pretty good... 
SARAH ROBERTSON Yes. 
JOHN TULD We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close.

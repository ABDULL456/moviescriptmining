{"train": "SUGAR \nWritten by \nAnna Boden & Ryan Fleck \n1    EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY \nA high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in progress. \nA1   ON THE FIELD \nWearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark- skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised for the next pitch. \nCLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZ\u00daCAR/SUGAR - 19, lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES the ball toward the plate. \nTHUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball slams inside. \nUMPIRE Strike three! \nThe BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball. \nFROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS. \nBEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH. \nAs the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball. \nThe next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely. \nB1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1 ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   2. \nC1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1 kicks the dirt. \nMiguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt. \nSome players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin. \nHe sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air. \n2    INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                   2 \nThe TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert. \nMARCOS Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more. \nMIGUEL (mouth full of food) All muscle, baby. Rock solid. \nFor some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE uniforms by their BLACK \"tryout\" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat. \nPEDRO Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere. \nA few of the guys LAUGH. \nMIGUEL (to Pedro) If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too. \nThe other guys \"ohhhh\" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel exchange subtle grins. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     3. \n3   INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY                                  3 \nKids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated English instructor, SE\u00d1OR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each. \nSANCHEZ Fly ball. \nCLASS Fly ball. \nSANCHEZ Line drive. \nCLASS Line drive. \nSANCHEZ Ground ball. \nCLASS Ground ball. \nSANCHEZ Home run! \nCLASS Hone rone! \nCLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words. \n4   INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT                                  4 \nIt's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner. \nMiguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall, and into... \n5   THE WEIGHT ROOM                                                    5 \n...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer, then leans back onto the bench. \nTRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses. \nFADE OUT. \nMisses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until... \n...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in Jose's mitt. \nThe other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     7. \n9     INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY                                       9 \nSr. Sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard, reading off lines of a scripted ENGLISH DIALOGUE for the class to repeat. The class' version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible. \nSANCHEZ I want to talk to you. \nCLASS I want talk to you. \nSANCHEZ Your performance in the mound is not as good as last year. What is the problem? \nCLASS Your performance in the mound is not good as last year. What is problem? \nSANCHEZ I don't know. Maybe my mechanic. \nCLASS I don't know. Maybe mechanic. \nSANCHEZ I want to give you a chance.   It is up to you... \nCLOSE ON Miguel focused on the baseball in his hand. He practices his knuckle curve grip, not participating in the lesson. \nCLASS I want to give you a chance.   Is up to you... \n10    EXT. BASEBALL ACADEMY - MORNING                                   10 \nMiguel walks down a dirt road with his duffel bag. He exits past the gate, waving goodbye to the SECURITY GUARD. \nA10   Beyond the manicured lawns and landscaped gardens of the          A10 Academy, Miguel passes through the overgrown, undeveloped land where neighborhood CHILDREN play among grazing goats. He continues down the dirt road towards a paved highway in the distance, as bachata music fuels the sound track, and carries over the following... \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     8. \n11    INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                              11 \nThick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. CLOSE ON Miguel staring out the bus window. On his way home, he passes... \nA11   --half-clothed children flying a homemade kite.                    A11 \nB11   --a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top.      B11 \nC11   --an old man sitting by the street, looking straight at Miguel. C11 \nD11   --flaming sugarcane alongside the road.                            D11 \nE11   --three children wedged between their parents on a motorbike.      E11 \nF11   --the tall, wheezing smokestack of the Cristobal Colon sugar       F11 refinery. \n12    EXT. STREET - SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS -   DAY                         12 \nMiguel hops off the bus with his duffel, climbs the pedestrian walkway passing over dozens of rusty railroad cars used for transporting sugarcane to the refinery. We PAN Miguel across the bridge, revealing burning smokestacks in the distance. \n13    EXT. SIDE STREET - MINUTES LATER                                   13 \nModest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos to Miguel, who smiles back. \nLocal KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard. They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, SHOUTING his name. \nAs Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles. \nWith the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the balls, then run off to play. \nMiguel approaches Erica.   She puts down her water bucket, gives Miguel a hug. \nMIGUEL How are you, sis? \nERICA Any news about the States? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   9. \nMIGUEL Is that all you have to say? \nMiguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof. On the lot next to their house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block. \n14   INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT                                         14 \nMiguel and Erica enter the house, where their brother LUIS (7) watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. The reception is still crappy, though. \nMiguel's grandmother, ABUELA, sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room. \nMIGUEL Hello, Abuela. You're looking beautiful. \nShe smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug. Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open. \nMIGUEL What's up my people?   How's the TV? \nLUIS Erica won't let me watch baseball. \nERICA Not during American Idol, anyway. \nMiguel's mother, CARMEN (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a \"wall\" separating two rooms. \nMiguel, Sofia, JAVIER (Black, 22) JAMIE (Black, 26) and ALEXANDRA (one of Sofia's friends) hang out by the malec\u00f3n (waterside), drinking rum and dancing to merengue that blasts out the open doors of a nearby car. The mood is festive. \nJAVIER (mid-story) I liked her, but she asked me to cut my hair. I thought about it. She was cute, but... I liked my hair more. \nSOFIA I liked it too, Javi. \nMIGUEL Then why'd you cut it last week? \nJAVIER I thought it was time for a new look. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      13. \nMIGUEL Or a new girl. \nSofia punches Miguel in the arm. \nMIGUEL Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with. \nJAVIER He's right!    All hail the golden arm. \nJavier and the girls drunkenly salute Miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but Jaime doesn't play along. He looks on, a little jealous. \nJAIME You call that flabby rubberband an arm? \nJAVIER Oooh... \nMIGUEL This flabby rubberband can throw 95. What can yours do? \nJAIME I threw 98 in double-A Portland. \nMIGUEL 98? Then why you washing windshields now? I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week. \nEveryone cracks up laughing, including Jaime, as Miguel grabs Sofia, and leads her in a dance. \nHis smile fading, Jaime looks out over the water.   Miguel notices this. Hold. \nEXT. SAN PEDRO TOWN - MORNING Various Sunday morning images establishing Miguel's hometown: \n--A dewey mist covers an empty baseball field, surrounded by acres of tall sugarcane. \n--Women hang laundry on the line to dry. \n--A rooster walks alone through a graveyard. \n--People spill out of church into the road. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   14. \n--MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink beer in the dugout during a softball game. \n21   EXT. EMPTY LOT FIELD - DAY                                        21 \nA makeshift diamond is overrun with weeds, ditches, stones, and trash for bases. Donkeys graze in the outfield, unphased by the LITTLE KIDS (10-14 years old) playing around them. \nA YOUNG PITCHER fires in a fastball that BEANS the YOUNG HITTER in the back. \nIN THE BLEACHERS, TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink beer and occasionally heckle the kids. \nHECKLER #1 You're supposed to aim for the head! \nNearby, Miguel sits beside his old coach, FRANK (early 40s), watching the kids play. One of the local SHOE SHINE BOYS cleans Miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as Frank cracks open a beer. Frank points out one of the kids on the field. \nFRANK I like this one. Good bat speed. Only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. His mom tells me he's missing school. I say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing? \nThey laugh. \nFRANK I'm showing his older brother to the Yankees on Monday. \nMiguel nods, a hint of disappointment in his eyes. \nFRANK (seeing this) They don't know what they missed with you. It's cool though. They'll be knocking on your door, offering millions when you turn into a superstar. You'll see... \nMiguel nods, appreciating the vote of confidence. \nMIGUEL Have you been to New York? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   15. \nFRANK (nodding) Nothing like playing for a crowd of New Yorkers. They're even louder than Dominicans. \nMIGUEL What's the city like? \nFRANK It's great. But you need to get to Kansas City before you start thinking about New York. Know what I mean? \nMIGUEL You hear anything about spring training yet? \nFRANK Yep. \nFrank sips his beer. \nMIGUEL And? \nFrank shrugs, as Miguel's sister calls out from the street-- \nERICA Miguel, Luis! Dinner is ready! \nMIGUEL You'd tell me if you knew. \nMIGUEL Good for you. Congratulations.     How much they offer you? \nSALVADOR (with a big smile) (sensing the other players surprise) But, you know, my manager's taking, like, forty of it... What'd you sign for? \nMIGUEL Oh, you know, more or less the same. Did you get any other offers? \nSALVADOR Yankees and Seattle, but not as much. \nMIGUEL Just don't get cocky. No one likes a dickhead... Welcome to the team. \nSalvador smiles. \nSALVADOR So, why do they call you Sugar? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      19. \nMIGUEL Well it's like this... it started cause I'm sweet with the ladies. But mostly it's cause I got the sweetest knuckle curve in the whole Republic. \nALFONSO (interjecting) Bullshit! You just learned that shit on Friday! It's cause he eats so much junk food! \nSalvador notices two pieces of cake on Miguel's tray. \nMIGUEL (playing it cool) He's just jealous. \nMiguel notices Pedro across the room, staring at his food. \n34   INT. ACADEMY RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT                               34 \nA dozen players sit around the television, watching a shlocky American horror film on DVD. \n35   IN THE ADJOINING DORMITORY                                         35 \nPedro packs his belongings into a KC Knights' duffel bag, when Miguel, Marcos, and Alfonso approach his bunk. \nMIGUEL We got you a going away present. \nMiguel unzips his windbreaker to reveal a bottle of Brugal rum hidden underneath. The other guys smile mischievously. \n36   EXT. ACADEMY BUILDING - NIGHT                                      36 \nMiguel, Marcos, Alfonso, and Pedro tip-toe across the gravel, whispering at each other to shut up. \n37   EXT. OBSERVATION TOWER - LATER                                     37 \nThe four players toast their rum in little plastic cups.   The bottle is nearly finished. \nMARCOS You should try Los Campos. I heard the Dodgers could use a new first baseman. \nPEDRO Fuck that. The coaches are even tougher over there. I'm done, man. (MORE) \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     20. \nPEDRO (cont'd) No more curfews, nobody tellin' me what to do and how to do it. For real, I'm glad this shit's over. I'm a free man. \nAwkward silence. The players look at Pedro with pity, unsure how to respond. After a beat, Miguel mocks coach Reyes and the others follow suit, mocking Alvarez and the other coaches. \nMIGUEL (snatching Pedro's cap) No caps indoors, son! \nALFONSO Cut the meat with your knife; eat the meat with your fork. NEVER eat the meat with your knife. \nMARCOS Or you'll chop off your tongue. \nMIGUEL Ten p.m. lights out! \nPEDRO (in broken English) \"Tay me outta the ball game, tay me outta the crowd...\" \nThe other players laugh, join Pedro in a loud whisper... \nALFONSO/MIGUEL/MARCOS/PEDRO \"...buys me so peanut and crackay- yacks. I doe-care if I never get back. Roo, roo, roo for home teams, we doe- win is a shame...\" \nPedro breaks off from the song, looks out over the field, on the verge of crying. One by one, the other players take notice and stop singing. Silence. Hold. \n38   INT. ACADEMY BATHROOM - DAY                                        38 \nHungover, Miguel vomits in the toilet.    Reyes opens the stall. \nREYES Santos, what the hell's wrong with you? \nMIGUEL I think I have the flu, coach.    I can't pitch today. \nReyes glances over to Marcos and Alfonso standing nearby. They lower their heads in embarrassment like two kids busted by dad. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      21. \nREYES You've got five minutes to get out on that mound, Santos. \nReyes marches off. \n39   EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DAY                                             39 \nMiguel on the mound. Takes a deep breath. He utilizes every ounce of strength to deliver a pitch, and... \nCRACK! The visiting Detroit Academy HITTER knocks the ball over the left field wall for a homerun, wherein... \nBLAH! Miguel throws up on the mound.   All the players gasp in disgust, but Reyes just laughs. \nMiguel looks over to Alvarez, sitting under an umbrella with a clipboard, then to Reyes, hoping he'll yank him out of the game, but Reyes just claps. \nShe kisses him on the forehead. \nA SERIES OF JUMPCUTS present a variety of family and friends introducing themselves to Miguel. \nUNCLE ANGEL Miguelito! You gonna remember your uncle Angel when you're all big and famous? Don't forget your family, kid. Never forget where you came from. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nCOUSIN LUPE Lupe! Cousin Lupe! Remember that time we went skinny-dipping at the Malec\u00f3n? \nMIGUEL When? \nJUMP CUT TO: \nCOUSING FELIPE You were eight years old! Hated the goats so much. You would cry and cry and cry and cry. What a baby you were. Do you remember? \nJUMP CUT TO: \nMIGUEL What's your name? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07        25. \nAUNT LOLA Lola!   Your aunt Lola! \nJUMP CUT TO: \nUNCLE JEFFE Uncle Jeffe! \nJUMP CUT TO: \nNEIGHBOR ANA Your neighbor Ana. I grew up around the corner from here. \nAna lays a juicy kiss on Miguel.   He smiles. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nFRANK Don't give me any shit, kid.      I taught you everything you know. \nMiguel gives Frank a big hug. \nFRANK I'm damn proud of you, kid.    Your father would be, too. \nMIGUEL Thanks.    I owe it all to you. \nFRANK Not all.   Just forty percent. \nMiguel smiles, as Frank leans close. \nFRANK I spent the best years of my life playing in the States. Life gives you a lot of opportunities, but baseball only gives you one. Enjoy every minute of it. \nMiguel nods. \nFRANK How's your new curve? \nMIGUEL It's pretty sweet. \nFRANK Good.   Here... \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   26. \nFrank hands Miguel a pen. \nMIGUEL What's this for? \nFRANK Your autograph. \nMiguel seems puzzled, but searches for something to write on. \nFRANK I'm kidding, you arrogant prick. It's so you can write your family... and me, too... if you feel like it. \nMiguel gives Frank another hug. \n46   INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - LATER                                      46 \nMiguel dances salsa with Sofia, and then switches partners, dances with Carmen. \nAs he dances close with his mother, he catches a glimpse of Erica standing with some friends off to the side. \n47   EXT. CONSTRUCTION LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT                        47 \nMiguel and Erica stand in silhouette, isolated from the party raging outside. Miguel sands one of the legs of the dining table. \nMIGUEL Where's your boyfriend? \nERICA Which one? \nMIGUEL I don't know; the ugly one. \nERICA Hector? \nMIGUEL Okay, where's Hector? \nERICA (shrugs, then) Some other party. \nMIGUEL So what about the good-looking one? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      27. \n55    EXT. SPRING TRAINING FIELD - DAY                                   55 \nFROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, we look down over the multiple-field spring training complex, where the MINOR LEAGUERS work out. The vast facilities are triple the size of what we saw in the Dominican Republic. \nA55   ON THE FIELD, Miguel, Marcos, and Jorge stretch out on the         A55 grass. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    30. \nJorge, wearing an elastic knee brace, points out a young, AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUY running wind sprints across the field... \nJORGE Brad Johnson. He just signed for a million dollars out of college. \nMiguel and Marcos watch Brad with fascination, searching for some sort of physical representation of his wealth. \nJORGE There's a lot of guys like that. But you can't let that intimidate you. Everyone knows Dominicans rule the game. \nTwo Venezuelan players, ORLANDO MATO (23, catcher) and ED POVEDA (22, center field) step up. \nORLANDO What's this about Dominicans ruling the game? \nED No, he must've said Venezuelans. \nJorge stands up, exchanges hugs with Orlando and Ed as they continue their debate over which Latin country has the best players. \nJORGE Sammy, Manny, Pedro... \nED Santana, Zambrano, the Guillens! \nJORGE Are you guys all from the same family? \nORLANDO Look who's talking... Are these your brothers? \nJORGE What, all Dominicans look the same, now? \nThey all smile, stop razzing each other momentarily to meet the new players. \nJORGE This is Miguel and Marcos. Up from Boca Chica. (to Miguel and Marcos) (MORE) \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    31. \nJORGE (cont'd) Orlando and Ed. We all played in Bridgetown together before I moved up to Double A and left these fools behind. \nORLANDO But you couldn't hang in Wichita. \nJORGE I injured my knee, asshole.    But I'm healthy now. You'll see. \nORLANDO Fifty bucks you're back in Iowa next month. \nJORGE Fifty bucks you're still an asshole next month. \nThey all LAUGH. \n56   ON THE FIELD - LATER                                               56 \nPitching coach, STU SUTTON (white, 40s), addresses the minor league pitching staff in mid-speech. \nSTU You've gotta show us your best game here. Remember that, until you reach the top, there's always guys above you, hustling to keep you here. And guys below you pushing to take your job. We have 75 pitchers in this camp competing for less than 50 positions come April 3rd. So you gotta work hard... \nWhile all the players respectfully listen to Stu, it is clear that very few of the Latino players can understand him. \n57   LATER ON THE PRACTICE MOUNDS                                       57 \nMiguel stretches his arm, while observing another group of PITCHERS throwing in the bullpen. He stares at them with intensity, sizing up his new competition. \n58   LATER ON THE FIELD                                                 58 \nMiguel faces off against a HITTER in a simulated game scenario. One, two, three, he strikes him out on three straight pitches. \nStu and another COACH exchange impressed looks. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      32. \nSTU Bring over Leonard. \nThe other Coach calls over to the adjoining field. \nCOACH Bring over Leonard! \n59    ON THE FIELD - MINUTES LATER                                       59 \nON major league all-star ROB LEONARD in the batter's box, awaiting Miguel's pitch. \nMiguel takes a deep breath, psyches himself up. He puts everything he has into a hearty fastball, which... \n...sails right over the plate for a STRIKE, as Leonard calmly watches and readies himself for the next one. \nFeeling confident with his stuff, Miguel fires in the next pitch, and... \nWHACK!   Leonard sails it over the right field wall. \nStu Sutton smiles at Miguel. \nSTU Welcome to America, kid. \n60    INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT                                       60 \nCLOSE ON a plate of french toast. Miguel, Marcos, Antonio, and Julio all chow down on french toast again. They eat in silence for a few beats, until... \nMiguel sends in the next one, and... \n...the HITTER checks his swing, but goes too far. \nUMPIRE Two! \nIN THE DUGOUT Marcos gets to his feet, clapping for encouragement. \nMiguel nods to Orlando, delivers again... \nCRACK! The ball is smoked toward Brad Johnson at second base. He leaps out, body fully extended, and makes a fantastic catch. But he's not done yet... \nThe runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the sweetest double-plays you'll ever see. \nMiguel pumps his fist into the air, and the team runs to... \n67   THE DUGOUT                                                         67 \nMarcos and Julio are the first to greet Miguel with high-fives. Orlando, Ed, and Jorge, coming off the field, follow in suit. Miguel awaits Brad's return to the dugout and high-fives him too, but they soon return to their segregated places on opposite ends of the bench. \n68   INT. CLUBHOUSE - DAY                                               68 \nMost of the players are gone or heading out when Miguel approaches his catcher, Orlando, a few lockers away. \nMIGUEL Where did you learn English so good? \nORLANDO Back home in Caracas. \nMIGUEL Like in high school, or something? \nORLANDO Yeah, but it's still hard though. People talk fast. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   36. \nMiguel agrees, as an ASSISTANT COACH finishes handing out checks to the remaining players. \nMiguel sits on the bench near his locker, opens his envelope to find... \nINSERT:   a check for $502.18. \nHe SMILES. \n69   INT. CLASSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                    69 \nThe ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR goes over baseball related vocabulary off- screen, while Miguel glances through his \"English for Baseball Players\" notebook. \nHe finds a page with pictures of different foods along with their English names. He looks at all the foods, stops at an image of a fried egg. He circles the word \"egg.\" \nThe instructor finishes up class, and the exhausted Latino players get up to leave. Marcos stands, leans over to Miguel. \nMARCOS C'mon.    Let's grab some dinner. \nMIGUEL Nah, I'm gonna stay and work out a little. I'll catch up later. \n70   INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT                                           70 \nMiguel does bicep curls alone in the weight room, when... \n...Brad Johnson enters. They exchange hello gestures, and proceed to workout on opposite sides of the room. After finishing his set, Miguel turns to Brad. \nMIGUEL (struggling in English) Good catch. \nBRAD Thanks... I got lucky. \nThey continue with their respective routines. \n71   INT. WESTERN UNION - NIGHT                                         71 \nCLOSE ON Miguel's hands counting out seven fifty-dollar bills. \nHe approaches the CLERK behind thick, bullet-proof glass, and slides the money and routing slip through a retractable tray. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       37. \nHe smiles BIG at the clerk.      Proud. \n72    INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT                                            72 \nThe usual waitress hovers over Miguel, alone at the usual booth. \nWAITRESS French toast, right? \nMIGUEL No...   Egg.    Egg, please. \nWAITRESS Eggs. No problem. How would you like'm? \nMiguel stares at her. \nMIGUEL Yes. \nWAITRESS Um, okay, uh... Scrambled?       Over easy? Sunny side up? \nA beat... He didn't count on this part.      He thinks hard, pressure mounting. \nMIGUEL (giving up, embarrassed) French toast. \nWAITRESS No eggs?   You sure? \nJORGE Thank you.   This is Miguel. \nOrlando whistles to Jorge from a taxi. \nJORGE I go now.    Take care of my friend. \nJorge waves goodbye to the Higgins, pats Miguel on the back, and hops in a cab with Orlando and Ed. \nAwkward beat, as Miguel, Earl, and Helen stand in silence. \n77   EXT/INT. HIGGINS CAR - DAY                                         77 \nEarl and Helen ramble on in English, while Miguel spaces out the back window at the passing corn stalks, which are strikingly similar to the sugar cane stalks back home. \nHELEN We've had Dominicans, Venezuelan boys, a Colombian, one from Panama, blacks and some Americans. Mostly Spanish boys, though. Johan Santana, Mendy Lopez and Ramon Martinez all stayed with us. Years ago. \nEARL Last year we had this boy, Junior Sanchez. Nice boy. Decent with the glove, but couldn't bunt to save his life. \nHELEN Two-for-twelve in sacrifice situations. \nEARL Cost the team at least two victories. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    41. \nHELEN Oh, that's being generous!   I'd say four or five. \n78    INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - DAY                                         78 \nMiguel, Earl, and Helen enter the old, crickety home. \nHELEN Put your things down.   I'll show you around. \n79    INT. KITCHEN                                                         79 \nHELEN This is the kitchen. Help yourself to whatever you'd like. You can make a list of special foods you like to eat and put it here. \nHelen points to a grocery list tucked under a broccoli magnet. \nHELEN Oh, and over here, this drawer is a little funny. \nShe pulls open the silverware drawer. \nHELEN You have to be careful or... \nShe pulls it a little too far and it falls off its rail.    Miguel nods. \n80    INT. WASHER/DRYER ROOM                                               80 \nHELEN This is the washer and the dryer. For your clothes. You put the soap in this one. Sopa. \nMiguel looks at her, confused.   Did she just say \"soup\"? \nHELEN (CONT'D) The other one's just hot air. Caliente. \nA80   INT. STAIRCASE                                                    A80 \nMiguel follows Helen up the stairs. \nHELEN Your room is up here. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   42. \n81   IN THE BATHROOM                                                   81 \nHELEN (in bad Spanish) El banyo. \nShe laughs.   Miguel smiles, appreciating the effort. \n82   INT. MIGUEL'S NEW BEDROOM                                         82 \nHELEN Your new cuarto. Bedroom. Do with it as you please. Just no girls. Chicas? No chicas. \nMiguel smiles, understanding. \n83   INT. KITCHEN - LATER                                              83 \nEarl and Helen break down the rules for Miguel at the table. \nEARL No drinking. No cervezas in the casa. No chicas in the bedroom. \nHELEN I already told him that one. \nEARL Okay.     What about quiet time? \nHELEN Right. There's no real curfew, but you must be quiet after ten. \nEARL Diez. (holding index finger to mouth) Shhhh... after diez. \nMIGUEL Ten.     Okay. \nHELEN Si! That's all we ask. It's our job to keep you healthy and focused on baseball. \nEARL And we take pride in that. \nMiguel smiles. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      43. \nMICHAEL This is good old-fashioned American home cooking, Miguel. Welcome to America. \nMIGUEL I like.   Thank you. \nEARL Well, very good, Miguel. De nada to you, mi amigo. De nada to you. \nAnne smiles at Miguel, a little embarrassed by her grandpa. Miguel smiles back, then gets back to his meatloaf. \n87   INT. BRIDGETOWN SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY                               87 \nThe team's CLUBHOUSE MANAGER (19, redheaded freckle face), hands out schedules to a handful of returning players. \nCLUBBY If you guys ever need tickets for family or friends, just let me know two days ahead of time. Thursday's opener is already sold out, but I saved one row, so you need to speak up now... \nMiguel enters the room, looking for his locker.    The Clubby takes notice. \nCLUBBY Santos - you're over there. \nClubby points Miguel in the right direction, where he finds his locker and several pressed jerseys waiting for him. Miguel takes his practice jersey, sits down in front of the locker, as... \nBRAD (O.S.) (in bad Spanish) Que pasa, hermano? \nBrad pats Miguel on the back.    Miguel is excited to see a familiar face. \nMIGUEL (in bad English) What up, Flaco? \nBRAD Dude, I was totally psyched when I saw your name on the squad. Good times. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     47. \nMIGUEL Yeah, okay. \nBrad finds his locker, and they both suit up. \n88   INT/EXT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER                      88 \nWe follow Miguel through the tunnel, which leads out to the... \n89   BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK FIELD                                   89 \nA stunning little park that sits at the Mississippi River's edge, underneath the Crescent Bridge. A dozen scattered players warm up on the lush green grass. \nA wide-eyed Miguel steps onto the field for the first time and takes it all in. Hold. \nFADE TO BLACK. \n90   INT. WESTLAND MALL - DAY                                           90 \nMiguel and Jorge stroll through the mall. Miguel notes the steady barrage of discount signs, plastic jewelry kiosks, and product samples. \n91   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MINUTES LATER                              91 \nMiguel follows Jorge through the men's section when a rack of Hanes underwear catches his eye. He turns a package over. \nINSERT: in a little corner of the package Miguel reads, \"MADE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\". \nHe checks the price tag. \nJORGE C'mon, bro, let's find you a suit. \nMIGUEL I can't afford a suit. \nJORGE I didn't say buy a suit. I said find a suit. So when you make it big, you'll already know what looks good. \n92   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE SUIT SECTION - NOT MUCH LATER                92 \nMiguel emerges from the dressing room in a white suit and electric blue collared shirt. \nJORGE Hot damn!   That's what's up! \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       48. \nMIGUEL You like it? \nJORGE I love it!   You look like an all-star, bro. \nMiguel admires himself in the mirror. \nJORGE (in a fake announcer voice, in English) \"Starting pitcher for American League... from Kansas City... Miguel... 'Sugar'... Santos.\" \nJorge fakes massive crowd applause.   Miguel laughs. \nMIGUEL What about you, man?   You try one. \nJorge shrugs, smiles. \nJORGE Me?   Nah... I'm all washed up. \nMIGUEL C'mon... \nJorge gets distracted by a pack of TEENAGE GIRLS cruising by. They smile at the players, who smile back. \nMIGUEL Very nice. \nJORGE Dude. You have no idea. Just wait till we go to Big Muddy's. \nMIGUEL Big Muddy's? \nAs Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork. But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in particular, who... \n...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     52. \nJACKASS (barely audible) Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle. \nMiguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them, and... \n...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other, though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific. \nBrad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything serious starts. They all hustle out to... \n102   EXT. BIG MUDDY'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT                              102 \nThe Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS. \nThey all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the club's entrance, watching them go. \n103   EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                    103 \nThe car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER. \nThe car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out with the hum of the engine. \nAn upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins' bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window. He tiptoes inside. \nThe sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to... \n104   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                                 104 \nWith the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices him as she sings. A smile. \nMiguel perks up. \n105   EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY                                     105 \nCHURCHGOERS flood out of the church after the service.    Anne walks alongside Miguel. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   53. \nANNE How'd you like the service? (off his blank stare) Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring for you. Did you go to church in the Dominican Republic? \nHe shakes his head. \nMIGUEL I am sorry.    I do not understand. \nANNE S'okay. You understand more than a lot of folks around here I bet. \nHe nods, still unsure. \nANNE So listen, me and some friends   are hanging out later. You should    stop by my house after the game. It's    gonna be super chill. Grandma can take    you there, but here... \nShe stops a random CHURCHGOER... \nANNE Can I borrow a pen real quick? \nThe churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on Miguel's forearm. \nANNE After the game. My house...     Good luck, tonight. \nAnne runs off.   Miguel looks after her, mystified. \n106   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                             106 \nHalf-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm. \nMiguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      54. \n107   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                    107 \nON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses himself. Play ball. \nMiguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first pitch high for a ball. \nWhen he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where... \n...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to the field in choice box seats. \nHe takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two. Same for the third. And forth. \nThe batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES. \n108   INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH                                        108 \nJack Jefferies does his thing on the mic. \nJACK JEFFERIES Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight. \n109   ON THE MOUND                                                        109 \nJorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first. \nJORGE Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay? \nMIGUEL No.   Thank you. \nTRAVIS It's like soccer. You play soccer? \nMIGUEL Soccer?   No. Baseball. \nTRAVIS Well this is called fooze-ball.   Fooze- ball. \nMIGUEL Foos-ball? \nTRAVIS Yeah, you got it. \nMiguel looks for Anne, sees her going over some papers with another kid. She sees Miguel, waves, then gets back to her conversation. \nRANDY I used to be a pitcher. In little league. I wasn't very good though. \nMiguel nods, and another girl, WENDY, chimes in. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      58. \nWENDY I heard that the beaches in the Dominican Republic are really beautiful. \nMiguel nods again. They stand in silence for an awkward beat, sipping from their red, plastic cups, until... \nANNE Hey guys, let's get started.   Everyone grab a seat. \nThe teens crowd into the living room, squeezing together on sofas, recliners, and desk chairs. Miguel sits behind the majority of the group, not sure what's going on. Anne stands before them... \nANNE I'm so glad you all came. Last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group. So, I think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word. But this year, I want us to work harder. Now, I know a lot of you are studying for SATs or working on college applications. And all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important. What we do in school or for a job... that's just a small part of who we are. We're only here by the grace of God, so let's get out there and share that grace. \nMiguel watches, still unsure what's going on. \n120   LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER                                       120 \nAnne leads the group in song, while Randy plays the piano. Miguel watches; he's the only person not singing. \nTHE GROUP (singing) One there is above all others, Oh, how He loves! His is love beyond a brother's, Oh, how He loves! Earthly friends may fail or leave us, One day soothe, the next day grieve us; But this Friend will ne'er deceive us: Oh, how He loves! \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   59. \nMiguel observes, a little disappointed, as this is not quite the date he was hoping for. \n121   EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                       121 \nMiguel and Brad are side by side in neighboring aisle seats, while Jorge and Jeff catch some Zs against the window. Miguel's \"English for Baseball Players\" workbook is on his lap, but he and Brad discuss language that won't likely be found there... \nMIGUEL Mama\u00f1ema.    Very bad.   Very bad word. \nBRAD Mama-\u00f1ema?    What's it mean? \nMIGUEL Mmm... Like-- \nMiguel mimes fellatio. \nBRAD Cocksucker? \nMIGUEL Cock-sucker? \nBRAD Yeah, we say cocksucker. \nMIGUEL Okay, cocksucker. \nBRAD Mama\u00f1ema. \nThey laugh. \nBRAD (in bad Spanish) Who is your favorite player? \nMIGUEL (in bad English) Robinson Cano for the Yankees.    I know him brother. And you? \nBRAD Roberto Clemente. \nMIGUEL Who is that? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    60. \nBRAD What?    You don't know about Clemente? \nMIGUEL Is Dominican? \nBRAD Puerto Rican. I can't believe it. This is tragic. Do you know who Babe Ruth is? \nMIGUEL Baby Ruth?   El chocolate? \nBrad stares at Miguel for a beat, and they both crack up. \nBRAD Hey, how'd it go with that girl the other night? \nMIGUEL Girl? \nBRAD Yeah, didn't you have a date, or something? \nMIGUEL Oh, she no es my girl. \nBrad senses Miguel's disappointment in the matter. \nBRAD No sweat, bro. We'll find you a little honey on the road. \nMiguel puts his ear to the door again, but can't hear anything, so he returns to the desk, begins carving again. \n134   EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                         134 \nOrlando and Ed play a spirited game of Casino on a Gatorade jug in the aisle while Miguel, Jorge and Brad chat about movies. \nBRAD Did you ever see \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"? \nMIGUEL Y tu mama what? \nBRAD Y Tu Mama Tambien... It's Mexican. \nJorge laughs, shakes his head. \nMIGUEL No, I don't know this. \nBRAD What are your favorite movies? \nJORGE Terminator. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    64. \nMIGUEL I like Matrisse. \nJORGE Oh, Matrisse. Very strong. \nBRAD Matrisse?   What's that? \nMIGUEL He doesn't know Matrisse? \nJORGE You don't know The Matrisse? \nBRAD The Mattress? I don't know. (turns to Jeff, beside him) Dude, do you know a movie called The Mattress? \nJEFF The Mattress? \nJORGE With Keanu...? \nJEFF Keanu Reeves? \nBRAD Oh, shit!   The MATRIX!! \nMIGUEL Matrisse! \nBRAD Yeah, yeah, the Matrix is badass.   I was like, Mattress? What? \n135   INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                        135 \nHe finishes   up a birthday card to his sister Erica, encloses it in a padded   envelope along with the wooden etching he carved earlier - a   pendant with a cornstalk design. The NYC calendar on the wall   in the background indicates we are now in JUNE. \nWhen he's done, he goes to his duffel, pulls out his English language workbook. \nMiguel sits on his bed, opens the book. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     65. \n136   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - DAY                             136 \nA batter swings and misses for strike three.    The catcher throws the ball around the horn. \nMiguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction, gets the ball back. \nHis next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line, where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play... \nMiguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but... \nOUCH! \n...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground.   The runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet. \nStu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate. \nSTU Nice play, kid.     How's your foot? \nJORGE You okay? \nMiguel nods, but he's limping back to the mound. \nSTU Take it easy. Don't force it.     How's it feel? \nORLANDO (translating) Don't push it. Does it hurt? \nMIGUEL I'm okay. \nSTU Let him toss a few warm-ups. \nThe umpire grants Miguel a few \"test\" pitches. \nVisibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle, makes a face. \nStu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       66. \nSTU All right, kid.     Give it a rest. \nAs Stu reaches for the ball, Miguel pulls it away. \nMiguel sits, gets back to work on the drawer.    Anne looks at him for a second, then exits. \nMiguel glances out the window, watches Anne climb into a pickup truck idling in the driveway. Anne and Miguel make brief eye contact before the truck speeds away, a trail of dust following it into the distance. \nA146   EXT. CORN FIELDS - DUSK                                           A146 \nMiguel walks down a path in the middle of the Higgins' corn field. He finds a cob of corn, removes the leaves, and examines the kernels up close. \nZOOM IN to ECU of a single kernel. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    75. \nMiguel stares at the raw corn with strange fascination. \nFADE OUT. \n147   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY                                        147 \nMiguel walks in without crutches, looking healthy. He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker. \nStu approaches Miguel... \nSTU There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder. They called up Brad this morning... He left you this... \nStu hands Miguel an old paperback book. \nINSERT: a Spanish-language version of Roberto Clemente's biography. Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has inscribed a note, \"See you in Kansas City, Mama\u00f1ema!\" \nMiguel smiles, bittersweet, when a familiar VOICE calls out... \nSALVADOR Yo!   Sugar! \nMiguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny kid from the Academy) running at him. They hug. \nMIGUEL Holy shit!     How'd you get here? \nSALVADOR On a airplane, motherfucker. \nMiguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face for being a smartass. \nSTU Great, you guys know each other. Sal's our new middle-relief man. Throws a nasty cutter. You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos... \nMIGUEL Okay. \nStu walks back towards the coaches' office. \nSALVADOR What he say? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    76. \nMIGUEL (not sure himself) Don't worry about it... Good to see you. \nSALVADOR Good to see you, too, Sugar. (a beat) I'm a little nervous. \nMIGUEL Look, just remember... it's the same game we played back home. Same rules, different place. Just have fun. It's only a game. \n148    EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - NIGHT                           148 \nCLOSE ON Miguel swearing at himself, clearly not following his own advice. \nA RUNNER circles the bases after hitting a homerun. \nJACK JEFFERIES (V.O.) Santos allows his second homerun of the game.   First night off the DL, and not looking so sharp. \nThe SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th. \nMiguel glances out of the corner of his eye to... \nTHE DUGOUT \n...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard. \nMIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way out to the mound.

I'm actually just trying to make a coffee table, and I'd like to buy some wood and supplies. \nOSVALDO I don't really sell raw materials... \nMiguel hesitates. \nMIGUEL I just moved here, you know, and I don't have a space to work. Do you think I could do some work for you, help you clean up or whatever you need, in exchange for using your shop? You don't have to pay me. \nOsvaldo sizes up Miguel's unusual request. \nOSVALDO Somebody paying you for the table? \nMIGUEL No. It's a gift for my mom.   Something I like to do. \nOSVALDO How old are you? \nMIGUEL Twenty. \nOSVALDO Who taught you to make tables? \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   98. \nMIGUEL My dad.

I used to play baseball. \nOsvaldo nods, understanding. \nOSVALDO The whole world plays baseball. My son's sixteen. Won't touch a piece of wood that's not a bat. I never cared for the game, myself. Too slow. \nMiguel laughs. \nOSVALDO Your mom still in San Pedro? \nMIGUEL Yeah.    With my sister and brother. \nOSVALDO So, you're telling me that you want to make a table for your mom, then mail it back to her in the Dominican? \nMiguel nods.

You know him? \nMiguel shakes his head, no. \nOSVALDO You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the \"whites only\" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, \"I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people.\" \nOsvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next. \nOSVALDO So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, \"That's okay, I don't eat colored people.\" \nAfter a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure.

He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his cross, whispers a prayer to himself. \nWinds up, throws, and... \nTHUD! \n...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the old days. Miguel's \"stuff\" is back. And he knows it. \nA161   IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen settle into their box seats          A161 eating caramel corn and cola. \nB161   RADIO ANNOUNCERS BOOTH.    Jack Jefferies at the mic...            B161 \nJACK JEFFERIES Miguel Santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. I don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the Santos we knew earlier this season. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    82. \nC161   IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in C161 Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could be his last. \n162    ON THE MOUND - 2ND INNING                                           162 \nCLOSE ON MIGUEL.    Sweating more than he should at this point in the game, but... \n...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters, striking out two more in the 2nd. \nA162   IN THE STANDS.   Earl and Helen CHEER for their Miguel.           A162 \n163    IN THE DUGOUT - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    163 \nStill sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth. The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees... \n...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps). \nStu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see him mouth the words, \"You okay?\", but NO SOUND comes out. \nMiguel nods, yes. \n164    BACK ON THE FIELD - 5TH INNING                                      164 \nAnd back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop. Orlando motions for him to calm down. \nThe next pitch is closer, but still high. \nAnd the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh. \nMiguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart is racing. \nA164   IN THE RADIO BOOTH                                                A164 \nJACK JEFFERIES Top of the fifth and Santos is showing some control issues. Not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself. \nB164   ON THE MOUND, Orlando runs out to Miguel.                         B164 \nORLANDO Don't worry about it. You're all good. Just relax. Throw strikes. They can't touch you. Just throw strikes. \n", "test2_true": "Miguel nods.   Orlando goes back behind the plate. \nMiguel glances to the runner at first, then delivers... \nUMPIRE Strike! \nOrlando nods, encouraging.      Throws the ball back. \nMiguel takes another deep breath. He whispers a prayer to himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and... \n...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field. \nMiguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases. \nSTU shakes his head in disappointment. \nC164   FROM THE BULLPEN, Salvador watches, concerned.                     C164 \nD164   FROM THE STANDS, Earl and Helen clap for encouragement.            D164 \nE164   MIGUEL does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering toE164 himself, which makes him look crazy. \nAnother deep breath.    Another pitch... \nUH-OH. \nThis one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt to avoid contact. It's on. \nUMPIRE (ejecting Miguel) You're outta here! \nThe batter leaps to his feet, walks out toward the mound, pointing his finger at Miguel, PISSED. \nMiguel opens his arms, inviting a fight.     Orlando steps between them. \nBATTER Fucking Puerto Rican piece of shit! \nMIGUEL (in English) Fuck you, cocksucker! \nBoth benches clear, as players rush out onto the field to restore order. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       84. \nMiguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the other players swirl around them, creating little sub-conflicts of their own. It's a mess. \nThe sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again. There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence. \nMiguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself... Hold, until... \n...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind. \n165   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE SHOWERS - A LITTLE LATER                       165 \nMiguel showers alone. \n166   INT. HIGGINS KITCHEN - NIGHT                                        166 \nMiguel eats a late dinner at the table. Earl sits at the other end, sipping some tea, while Helen does dishes at the sink. The mood is uncomfortably tense. Nobody says a word, until Miguel musters up the courage. \nMIGUEL I'm sorry. \nHelen turns off the faucet, turns around. Earl methodically sets down his mug, stands up, and crosses to Miguel. Puts his arm around his shoulder, wherein... \n...Miguel breaks down, hugs Earl around the waist, his face pressed against his stomach. He's crying. Hold. \n167   INT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - COACHES' OFFICE - EVENING         167 \nStu addresses Miguel before the game. Though his words are encouraging, his tone is detached, cold. Miguel senses this, listens, dejected. \nSTU You played with your emotions, and your emotions got the best of you. Happens to everyone. It's just a nasty part of the game. Nobody likes to admit it, but it is. The true test of our character as athletes... is how we come back. It's up to you. \nStu notices Hardy, the Swing mascot, pass by his office door. \nSTU Hardy! Don't wander off; I gotta talk to you about that accountant... \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    85. \n168    EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALLPARK - NIGHT                            168 \nMiguel sits out in the bullpen with the other relievers, while Stu continues in V.O. \nSTU (V.O.) So, um, anyway, I'm bumping Sal into your slot in the rotation. I'd like to see how you handle a relief spot. \nA168   ON THE MOUND, Salvador fires in the opening pitch.                A168 \nB168   IN THE RADIO BOOTH, Jack Jefferies does his play by play.         B168 \nJACK JEFFERIES Moving up from relief, Torres makes his third start for the Swing. I tell ya, this lanky kid from the Dominican Republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. Reminds me of a young Pedro Martinez... Hey there Bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. So pick yours up at the box office today... \n169    IN THE BULLPEN                                                    169 \nSimilar to an earlier sequence of JUMPCUTS on Miguel reacting to the game from the dugout, we now HOLD on Miguel, solemn and detached, from the bullpen. \nNOTE: the frame for the following images contains the first 3-4 rows of FANS seated behind the bullpen, so we can also use them to gauge what might be happening on the field. \nPLAY 1: Miguel, the FOUR RELIEVERS, and the fans clap for a nice play. \nPLAY 2: The fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit. \n", "test2_id": 1519, "test3_input": "PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco. \nPLAY 4: A new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field, leaving only two others with Miguel. \nPLAY 5: Miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the \"Chicken Dance\" behind him. \nPLAY 6: The fans leap to their feet in applause. The two relievers high-five. Miguel CLAPS, going through the motions. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07         86. \nPLAY 7: Miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the fans sing along to \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\" \nPLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only Miguel and one other guy. \nPLAY 9:   Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game, but... \n...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out onto the field. \nAs the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. Hold. \n170   INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                170 \nMiguel grabs a slip of paper from his nightstand. His large duffel bag is packed full in front of him. On the wall, his NYC calendar is turned to AUGUST. \nHe goes to the phone.   Dials... \nAfter a long beat he hangs up. \n171   INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING                            171 \nHelen walks in to find Miguel washing the dishes in the sink. \nHELEN Oh, honey, you don't have to do that. \nMIGUEL (his English better than ever) No problem. I want to help. \nHELEN Well, thank you, Miguel. \nHelen grabs a dish towel.      They do the dishes together in silence. After a beat... \nMIGUEL Thank you, Helen. \nHelen smiles, pats Miguel on the back.     HOLD. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   87. \n172   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - EARLY MORNING                   172 \nEarl drops off Miguel near the team bus, as players and coaches load their gear in, and get on. \nMiguel cautiously approaches the bus, sees Salvador, hesitates... \nMIGUEL I forgot something in the clubhouse. I'll be right back. \nAs Miguel turns, Salvador grabs his bag, which is still on his shoulder. \nSALVADOR Here, I'll load your bag. \nMiguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes. Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs away with Salvador looking on. \nED Where's he going? \nSALVADOR Bathroom. \nAT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees... \n...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window.   Sal raises his hand, very subtly waves goodbye. \nMiguel continues on his way. \n173   EXT. BURLINGTON BUS DEPOT - MINUTES LATER                         173 \nA local taxi pulls up, and Miguel hops out with his duffel bag. \n174   INT. BUS - DAY                                                    174 \nMiguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him. \nHe shoots her a cautious smile. \n175   INT. MOVING BUS - DAY/EVENING                                     175 \nMiguel stares, wide-eyed, out the window at the shifting landscapes, daytime into evening... \n--cornstalks. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    88. \n--bridges and rivers. \n--city lights. \nHe sleeps against the window, his Clemente book open on his lap. \n176   INT. MOVING BUS- LATER                                            176 \nFrom the New Jersey turnpike, Miguel sees the approaching Manhattan skyline in the early morning light. He sits up straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the distance. \n", "test3_true": "Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment. \nHe locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles. His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM. \nMiguel smiles. \nAT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a Metrocard vending machine nearby. \n178   AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER                                    178 \nFortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches and BEEPS, he's got his card. \n179   AT THE TURNSTILE                                                  179 \nHe swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile won't budge. He studies the message: \"SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS TURNSTILE\", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again, this time very slowly, but still can't get through. \nAn IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly. \nMiguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass. \nAfter the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again. \n180   INT. SUBWAY PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL                                     180 \nAs Miguel strolls through the underground hallway that connects the various Times Square subway lines, he sees... \n--a TEAM OF BREAKDANCERS performing for tips. \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   89. \n--billboard ads for movies, music, dermatologists, Mets baseball, etc. \n--a HOMELESS MAN passed out on the ground. \n--a WOMAN selling a random collection of objects: VHS tapes, batteries, a used blender... \n181   INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MOVING                                        181 \nMiguel observes other passengers, when the train emerges above ground. He stands, looks out the window as the train passes Yankee Stadium. \n182   EXT. 167TH ST. - THE BRONX     - DAY                              182 \nMiguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others. \nMiguel paces up the block, looking for something.    He smiles when he finds... \n...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and Spanish) hangs in the window. \n183   INT. EL RESTAURANTE CARIBE - DAY                                  183 \nMiguel takes a seat at the counter, smiles to the waitress, REYNA (cute, 20-something, Dominican). \nREYNA (in Spanish, of course) Talk to me. \nMIGUEL Is Jorge working today? \nREYNA Jorge? \nMIGUEL Jorge Ramirez. \nA bus boy, RAFAEL, overhears as he passes by. \nRAFAEL Jorge, the ball player! \nMIGUEL Yeah! \nOfficial Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   90. \nREYNA Oh. The ballpayer... He left about two weeks ago. \nRAFAEL I think he drives a car now. \nMIGUEL Do you have a phone number for him? His old one isn't working. \nReyna shrugs, looks to Rafael. \nRAFAEL (shaking his head) Sorry... But I think he was staying down at concourse village on 156th. \nREYNA He still comes in to eat sometimes. \nMiguel nods, looks off, a little anxious. \n184   EXT. 156TH STREET - DAY                                         184 \nMiguel glances up at the dozens of high-rise apartment buildings in every direction. \nHe walks away, discouraged. \n185   OMITTED                                                         185 \n186   EXT.

He looks up at the park's grand exterior with wonder. Approaches to get a closer look. \nThe Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a glimpse of the field through an iron fence.

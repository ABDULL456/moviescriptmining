INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY As they come inside. Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in each other's arms. 
The surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken floorboards. Rob and Kit stretch out. All the passion, all the tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that something is moving on the water below... 
And when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor! 
Kit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves. 
EXT. DOCK - DAY 
By the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage. 
ROB Skip! You sonofabitch! 
But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered skiff which continues bobbing out to sea. 
ROB 
starts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward, plunging 'into the water to reach the boat. 
ROB Skip... Skip! 
But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong. 
EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - DAY 
Rob and Kit come struggling up the path. Chaz trains his videopak on them from the porch . He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and sandwiches after their sweaty workout. CHAZ (commentary while he tapes) Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex. 
ARCH (CALLING ) Well, how was it? 
ROB Where's Skip? Anybody seen him? 
NIKKI Who wants to know? 
ROB Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer! 
They sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing . 
KIT (FRANTICALLY) We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...! 
CHAZ Well, if it was Skip... 
KIT I saw his face! 
ROB (DEMANDINGLY) Has anybody seen him since last night? 
They all realize they haven't. 
ROB (cont .) Jesus Christ... 
Rob turns, rushing into the house. 
INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY 
Rob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight bag. 
He turns and bounds up the stairs. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 
Rob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open. A cheap rubber hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling on frail, metal springs. 
Rob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out of his way and throws it down. 
This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room. 
But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure. 
The room is untouched, the bed unslept in. 
EXT . PORCH - DAY 
Rob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand. She approaches. 
MUFFY (noticing their distress ) Something wrong? 
Rob rushes by her. 
ARCH Wait! I'll go with you!

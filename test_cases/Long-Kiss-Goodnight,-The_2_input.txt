CLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass. 
TIMOTHY (O.S.) I want money, Charly. I know you've got numbered accounts, we all do. I'll let you know where and when. Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees. 
CHARLY You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*. 
TIMOTHY I'll be in touch. 
He hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL: 
The .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T operator. THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled. Charly points to the switchboard: 
CHARLY Give me an ANI trace. Do it. 
EXT. PINE-COVERED MOUNTIANS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING 
Set back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign: *Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty pole. Blinks forlornly. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME 
TIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the room: 
TIMOTHY It's done, she hooked. All I gotta do is set the ransom meet. 
PERKINS She mustn't suspect a trap. 
TIMOTHY No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, remember? Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate. 
Perkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her. Next to a brown paper bag. 
PERKINS God. We're monsters, aren't we...? (pause, then:) Forget Charly. Talk to me about tonight. 
TIMOTHY The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy. (points) What's in the sack? 
Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly. 
PERKINS That...? Something to prove that I'm not a complete ogre. 
He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL. Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow. 
PERKINS See? The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas. Very popular item. It... well, it pees. You put water in it and... oh, fuck you. 
INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK STATE - TWILIGHT 
Charly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS! *Where it's Christmas all year long*! 
HENESSEY Almost dark now. 
CHARLY Another ten minutes. You want my Crazy Meal action figure? 
HENESSEY Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing? We've got money, we could negotiate... 
CHARLY *I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's dead weight if she's sedated. 
HENESSEY Not so emotional, I'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here. 
CHARLY Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I can. This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy. 
HENESSEY Yeah? How come you know so much about this fucking guy? 
CHARLY Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know. 
HENESSEY I'm here. Suppose you tell me. 
CHARLY Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back in 
She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in: 
CHARLY I'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember...? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch...? 
The look in her eyes is feral. 
CHARLY It's almost dark. Let's get it done. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHTTIME 
Full dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck. 
EXT. SURROUNDING MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME 
In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss Nightvision binoculars. 
Welcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow. Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars, head in hands. 
HENESSEY What's the matter? 
CHARLY They're here. 
HENESSEY Who?

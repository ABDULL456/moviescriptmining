NICK I'd like to ask you a few more questions. 
CATHERINE I'd like to ask you some, too. 
She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles. 
CATHERINE For my book. 
She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches her. 
NICK (wary) What kind of questions? 
She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to him. 
CATHERINE How does it feel to kill someone? 
He looks at her a long beat. 
NICK (finally) You tell me. 
CATHERINE I don't know.  But you do. 
Their eyes are on each other. 
NICK (finally) It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire. 
CATHERINE Four shootings in five years.  All accidents. 
NICK (after a long beat) They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop. 
A long beat, as they look at each other. 
NICK Tell me about Professor Goldstein. 
BEAT. 
CATHERINE There's a name from the past. 
NICK You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins? 
She looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her eyes off him. 
CATHERINE Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. (she smiles) That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. (a beat) Hazel is my friend. 
NICK She wiped out her whole family. 
CATHERINE Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. 
NICK Didn't you study it in school? 
CATHERINE Only in theory. (she smiles) You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice. 
He stares at her a long beat. 
CATHERINE (quietly) What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much? 
NICK (after a beat) No. 
He stares at her, almost horrified. 
CATHERINE (quietly) Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do? 
She steps closer to him. 
CATHERINE Tell me, Nick. 
She puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand roughly, holds it. 
NICK I didn't. 
CATHERINE Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew. 
They are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the hand. 
CATHERINE Your wife knew, didn't she?  She knew what was going on.  Nicky got too close to the flame.  Nicky liked it. 
He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed against each other -- their eyes digging into each other. 
CATHERINE (in a whisper) That's why she killed herself? 
He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her go, turns away from her.

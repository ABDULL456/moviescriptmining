{"test1_input": "43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning. He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like some hopeful guy with a hot date. \n43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise. \n43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool. \nTIM Some cop is scoping for you, dude. \nJohn looks around the corner of the \"Afterburner\" ride.  Sees the cop showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way. \nJohn ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news. \nTHE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him. \nJOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back. THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed. John breaks into run.  So does the cop. Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John. John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms. \n44      INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR \nJohn emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects to the parking garage.  He's running full out, when around the corner ahead of him comes... \nTERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses. \nSLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR'S BOOT crushes the flowers as it moves forward. \nJOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber, slow and fluid. \nJohn looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop is aiming his gun at him! John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he's screwed.  Then something crazy happens... \nTERMINATOR Get down. \nJohn instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM! \nTHE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he fires the pistol.  The pistol's shot goes wild. \nTERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another. Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING. Then silence. \nTHE COP lies still on his back. \n44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta. \n44B     The \"cop\", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human, pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol. \nON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody holes in the motorcycle jacket. \nJOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator's body has blocked the bullets. \nThe Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound. Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts walking toward the \"cop\". The empty magazine clatters to the floor. The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide. Terminator still has twenty feet to go. He doesn't break his purposeful stride. \nThe cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator's chest.  He doesn't even flinch. Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's wardrobe to shreds. \nCLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second. \nWe realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don't know the details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is). A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800 Series \"Arnold\").  This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a few surprises. \nT-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first. He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and disappeared. \nJOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage. \n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd. \n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run. \n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away. \nHe sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show. The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked. \n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE \nJohn is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see -- The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him. John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage. \nJohn looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000 is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street. \n46      EXT. STREET \nJohn shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK. The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck. \n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph. T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him, up ahead, weaving through traffic. \n", "test1_true": "47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL \nJohn slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a narrower tributary which has vertical sides. \nHe looks back.  No sign of pursuit. 47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow. The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right into the center of the canal. \nIt crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering speed. \n47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray, backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And... it's gaining. \n47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow- truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet behind him and still gaining. \n47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall of metal filling frame behind him. \n47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the truck in the canal below. \n47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike. \n47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700- pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights for control. \n47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny Honda. Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him onto the Harley, in front of him.  John's Honda weaves and falls, smashing instantly under thundering tires. \nThe Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially a short tunnel. \n47I     The truck can't fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into the concrete abutment at seventy. \n47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks explode. \nTerminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal, disappearing around a bend. \n47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass. Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of flame.  A figure appears in the fire. Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly. The figure emerges from the flames. \nIt is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed. Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us. \nWith each step detail returns. First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features, ears... \n47K     But it's still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair, mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around. \nIt is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society. \n47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up. T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000 blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so perfect. It walks among the other cops unnoticed. Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away. \n48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nTerminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent of father/son, out for an evening ride. \nJohn is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know. \nJOHN Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike! \nTerminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn. They head into a nearby alley. \n49      EXT. ALLEY \nTerminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John checks him out.  Tentatively speaks. \nJOHN Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right? \nTERMINATOR Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101. \nJOHN No way! \nJohn touches Terminator's skin.  Then the blood on his jacket. His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him. \nJOHN Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah! (stepping back) You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside? \nTERMINATOR I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton. \nJOHN This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal? \nTERMINATOR My mission is to protect you. \nJOHN Yeah?  Who sent you? \nTERMINATOR You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time. \n", "test1_id": 2673, "test2_input": "SARAH Down on the floor!  Now! \nThey comply.  She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding her hostage.  She's actually pulling this off. \n71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can't see, it a third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He's poised, ready to jump her when she comes abreast of him. \nON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner. The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand. Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs \nSILBERMAN Get her! \nThey scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner. One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound. \n72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol. Heads for the security entrance. \n73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies charge after her. She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door. Tries it.  Locked. Footsteps like a drum solo behind her. \nShe fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in. The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt. Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it. She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch on the other side.  He's too late. \nSarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys. \n73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond. She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door. She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked. \nShe flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her. She slams the bars shut.  CLANG. Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her. The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage. \nShe reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach. He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off. \nSarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies. They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the lock -- The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in. Silberman shouts at them. \nSILBERMAN Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!! \nThe orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor to another set of doors. \n73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead. Now she's home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she's nearly there when the elevator doors part... \nTERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her. Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares. Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward. Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor, staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun. \nShe loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity. She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be screaming if she could get the breath to do it. In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall. \nShe runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and figures out instantly what happened. \nJOHN Mom!!  Wait! \nSarah doesn't hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare. They take off running after Sarah. \n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle. She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two orderlies leap into the fray. \nSARAH No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!! \nShe is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don't even look where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor. \nThey have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her. Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare. She screams in utter hopelessness. \nTerminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the floor. The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder. Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys. Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine. One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an office door, splintering it into kindling. \nSilberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn't human. He feels the fabric of reality crumbling. Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him, then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a second. \nSarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her. John kneels next to her. \nJOHN Mom, are you okay? \nShe looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator. Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad? \nIncredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see. \nTERMINATOR Come with me if you want to live. \nThe orderlies are stirring. \nJOHN It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help. \nSarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers. Terminator lifts her to her feet. \n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the walls of bars.  John doesn't know what we know, but he knows something's not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow John's gaze. The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side. Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up. \n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn't stop. Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste forced past an obstacle. Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this. That faint snapping sound is his mind. There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap. \n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It's been a heavy day for her. Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the shotgun and starts backing up. \n", "test2_true": "Sarah doesn't need to be told twice. T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power. Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES. The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000. \nTerminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a second. \n73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead, Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and John slaps the button for \"Garage Level\". \nThe doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner. Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning. The rounds hit the steel doors as they close. T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap. 73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that are punching holes in the other side. \n73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second later.  The elevator hasn't moved yet.  SSWWIKK! \n73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches the muzzle right INTO T-1000's face -- BOOM!! 73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000's head blown apart by the blast.  It is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends. \n73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly. There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the doors apart with inhuman strength 73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT. It falls two floors and... \n74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof. Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up. Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling. BEAT... Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears down four feet into the elevator car. It is inches from Sarah's face. She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof. Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches. Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in the ceiling. Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them slices open her upper arm. \n75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide enough. They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby. \nTerminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!? \n76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big enough to... Pour itself through. A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame as Officer X. \nIt seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and sees -- \n77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the clutch. The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie. \nTerminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator. The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the back wall of the elevator. Terminator rolls to his feet. Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it. Terminator catches the life flare with one hand. Levels the shotgun with the other. With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank. Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000. Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM! \nThe explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah toward the exit ramp. \n78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital security car comes screeching down the other way. Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a shrieking halt.  She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands. \nSARAH Out of the car!! \nThe patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round through the glass next to his head. \nSARAH RIGHT NOW! \nThe door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and dives into the front passenger seat as -- \n78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the tires on the slick ramp. Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket and starts feeding them in. Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely in control.  Because... \n79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below. This guy won't quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it runs. It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining. \n80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide. The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate. John hands the shot gun back to Terminator. He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer. The T-1000's face is right in the headlights. 80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal visible in the hole, which then closes. 80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire. The car crashes backward through the security barricade. \nTERMINATOR (calmly) Hang on. \nHe cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping ends with a screech. T-1000 is almost on them. Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward. \n80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk. Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid. Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down, punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up. Terminator turns to Sarah. \nTERMINATOR Drive. \nTerminator heaves himself half out the driver's window.  Sarah slaps her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side. \n80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and missing John by inches as he ducks. It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as -- \n80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car. Fires point-blank. Hits the T-1000's arm just above the \"hand\" which anchors it to the car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand. \n80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car. John looks out the back window, his eyes wide. He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running. But he's dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the liquid-metal killer won't catch them on foot. \n80G     John watches, in awe, as the \"crowbar hand\", stuck into the trunk right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob. \n80H     The car speeds off into the night. REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup, watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down. \n80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the T-1000's shiny cop shoe.  The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the main mass, disappearing into the \"shoe\". \n81      INT./EXT. SECURITY CAR \nA GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight highway.  Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in the wind. \n81A     INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.  The air is blowing in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by electronic night-vision.  His eyes glow faintly red. \nJOHN Can you see anything? \n", "test2_id": 2674, "test3_input": "SARAH Now, Enrique. (turns to Terminator and John) You two are on weapons detail. \nCUT TO: \nA103    EXT. COMPOUND/BEHIND THE TRAILERS \nThere is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the trailers.  John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand. \nJOHN Hook it on. \nTerminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the tractor.  John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads, pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate moves slowly under six inches of sand. \nJohn drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the ground.  Like the mouth of a tomb.  The kid drops down from the tractor and walks to the hole. \nJOHN One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead. \nA104    INT. WEAPONS CACHE \nFrom inside the \"tomb\".  Sunlight slashes down into a cinder-block room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long.  Sand spills down the steps.  The walls are lined with guns. \nJohn precedes Terminator into Sarah's weapons cache.  Rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, mortars, RPGs, radio gear.  At the far end, boxes containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling. Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.  He picks up a MAC-10 machine pistol.  Racks the bolt. \nTERMINATOR Excellent. \nJOHN Yeah, I thought you'd like this place. \nA105    EXT. COMPOUND/NEARBY \nSarah emerges from a trailer.  She has changed.  Boots, black fatigue pants, T-shirt.  Shades.  She looks hard. Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with Yolanda.  He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him, \nSALCEDA This is the best truck, but the water pump is blown.  You got the time to change it out? \nSARAH Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. (she pulls him away from Yolanda) Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get out tonight, too, okay? \nSALCEDA Yeah, Saralita.  Sure. (he grins) Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life. \nShe slaps him on the shoulder. \nCUT TO: \nA106    INT. WEAPONS CACHE \nTerminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo.  John is selecting rifles from a long rack. \nJOHN See, I grew up in places like this, so I just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow shit up. \nJohn grabs an AK-47 and racks the bolt with a practiced action. Inspects the receiver for wear.  Doesn't like what he sees.  Puts is back.  His movement are efficient.  Professional.  Uninterested. \nJOHN Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a regular school.  The other kids were, like, into Nintendo. \nTerminator has found a Vietnam-era \"blooper\" M-79 grenade launcher. A very crude but effective weapon.  He opens the breech and inspects the bore. \nJOHN Are you ever afraid? \nTerminator pauses for a second.  The thought never occurred to him. He searches him mind for the answer... \nTERMINATOR No. \nTerminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades. \nJOHN Not even of dying? \nTERMINATOR No. \nJOHN You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other? \nTERMINATOR No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter. \nJohn is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards and forwards like Bat Masteron. \nJOHN Yeah.  I have to stay functional too. (sing-songy) \"I'm too important\". \nTerminator pulls back a canvas tarp, revealing a squat, heavy weapon with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder.  Chain-ammo is fed from a canister sitting next to it.  A G.E. MINI-GUN.  The most fearsome anti-personnel weapon of the Vietnam era. Terminator hefts it.  Looks at John as if to say \"Can I?  Please?\" \nJOHN It's definitely you. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Sarah and John have their weapons and supply selections laided out on two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing.  Maps, radios, documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics.  Sarah is field- stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.  There is no wasted motion. \nNot far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.  They're greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump. \nJOHN There was this one guy that was kinda cool. He taught me engines.  Hold this a second.  Mom screwed it up, of course.  Sooner or later she'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote. \nJohn thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of parental connection is obvious. \nTERMINATOR Torque wrench please. \nJOHN Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad. \nTERMINATOR You will. \nJOHN Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt? (Terminator hands it to him) Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye. \nThey crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight. \nTERMINATOR Why do you cry? \nJOHN You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts. \nTERMINATOR Pain causes it? \nJOHN Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it? \nTERMINATOR No. \nTerminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the engine catches with a roar. \nJOHN Alriight!!  My man! \nTERMINATOR No problemo. \nJohn grins and does a victorious thumbs up. Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly. John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again. \nA108    SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and Terminator. \nA109    SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying.  It is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg.  Trying to get him to walk more casually.  John walks, then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.  They try it again.  Continued ad lib as we hear: \nSARAH (V.O.) Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.  The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy.  And it would die to protect him.  Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up.  In an insane world, it was the sanest choice. \nSarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman made hard and cold by years of hard choices. \nCUT TO; \nA110    EXT. ROAD - DAY \nA police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the outskirts of Los Angeles.  A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a freeway in the distance.  Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it. \nA111    IN THE CRUISER.  The T-1000 sits inside.  John's notes and letters are spread out on the seat beside it.  Sarah's voice speaks from a cassette deck.  John's tapes.  Her voices mixes with the static filled chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its targets. \nSARAH ... if we are ever separated, and can't make contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.  I'll rendezvous with you there. \nT-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section. It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier. \nECU on envelope.  We see the postmark:  \"Charon Mesa, Calif.\" \nTIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.  It glances up at the sound of crunching gravel.  In the rear-view it sees a BIKE COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.  The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser. \nBIKE COP Howdy.  I saw you pulled over here earlier. Everything okay? \nT-1000 Everything's fine.  Thanks for checking. (it gets slowly out of the car) Since you're here, though, can I talk to you a second... \nCUT TO: \nA112    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/MINUTES LATER \nThe T-1000 thunders along on the Kawasaki 1100, doing about a hundred and twenty.  PAN WITH IT until it recedes toward the horizon. \nCUT TO: \nA113    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON) \nSarah sits at the picnic table.  The weapons are cleaned and her work is done.  She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder. She draws her knife from its belt sheath. Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter \"N\". \n", "test3_id": 2675}

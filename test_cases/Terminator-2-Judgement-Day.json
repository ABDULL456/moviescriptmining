{"train": "\"TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY\" \na Screenplay \nby \nJames Cameron \nand \nWilliam Wisher \nRevised final shooting script \n1       EXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nDowntown L.A.  Noon on a hot summer day.  On an EXTREME LONG LENS the lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity.  In SLOW MOTION they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to bumper.  Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.  The image is surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to \nDISSOLVE TO: \n2       EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT \nSame spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles. Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark white in the moonlight against the charred rubble. A TITLE CARD FADES IN: \nLOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029 \n3       ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.  Beyond the mound is a vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.  The rush hour crowd burned down in their tracks. \n4       WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round has sagged in the firestorm.  Small skulls look accusingly from the ash-drifts.  WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing and laughing in the sun.  A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch lines are still visible. \nCAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the tiny skull of its owner.  HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks: \nVOICE 3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines... \nA metal foot crushes the skull like china. \nTILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle. It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting. \nThe SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in progress. \n5       EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT \nTHE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla army.  Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms. \nSEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS: 5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light. 5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion. 5C      Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK. \n5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator 5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator 5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg), with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the ground. \n5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing machines. \n6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches the combat with night-vision binoculars.  He wears the uniform of a guerrilla general, and a black beret.  He is still amid running, shouting techs and officers. \nC.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his eyes fill frame, then... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.  FILLING FRAME. \nVOICE (SARAH CONNOR) Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines, sent two terminators back through time.  Their mission: to destroy the leader of the human Resistance... John Connor.  My son. \nThe first terminator was programmed to strike at me, in the year 1984... before John was born. It failed. \nThe second was set to strike at John himself, when he was still a child.  As before, the Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A protector for John.  It was just a question of which one of them would reach him first... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n7       EXT. TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT \nWild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot of an all-night truck stop.  Then... \nThe strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY. Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP! \nThrough the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man. TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face: devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its surroundings. \n8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT \nOn a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on... \n13C     HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police cruiser.  FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser's door then MOVE UP as Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.  He looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his power, his expression emotionless and judgmental. Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night. \nCUT TO: \n14      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE/GARAGE - DAY \nTIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR, who at his moment is ten years old and busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike.  He has ripped Levi's and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.  The Ramones' \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" blasts from a boom box next to him. \nA WOMAN, JANELLA VOIGHT, stands in the doorway of the garage, yelling over the music. \nWOMAN ...John?  John!  Get in here right now and clean up that pigsty of yours. \nJohn's friend TIM, a thirteen-year-old Hispanic kid, watches as John replies by turning up the volume on the boom box. Janelle gives up with a SLAM of the house's back door. \nTIM Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right? \nJOHN Gimme that Phillips right there. \n15      INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM \nJanelle storms into the room.  TOD VOIGHT, her husband, watches sports on the TV.  They're both in their thirties.  Middle-class working stiffs. \nJANELLE I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid. He won't even answer me. (neither does he) Todd?  Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna do something? \nHe sighs.  Throws down the TV's remote and heads for the garage. \n16      INT. GARAGE \nJohn hops on the bike.  Kick-starts it.  Tim picks up John's nylon bag, then climbs on the back.  Todd ENTERS and shouts over the engine, which John revs louder and louder. \nTODD John!  Get your ass inside right now and do what your mother says! \nJohn pins Todd with a defiant glare. \nJOHN She's not my mother, Todd! \nHe revs the engine and peels out of the garage, with Tim almost falling off the back.  They take off down the street. \n17      EXT. VACANT LOT/DRAINAGE CANAL \nJohn cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced-in drainage canal.  He guns the bike through a hole in the retaining fence.  Tim's eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment. \n17A     IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along, throwing up a roostertail of muddy water.  Tim shouts, pretending he didn't just see his life flash before his eyes.  He slaps John on the back. \nTIM Major moves, homes!  So... where is your real mom, anyway? (John doesn't answer) She dead or something? \nIt's hard to read John's expression. \nJOHN She might as well be. \nJohn twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward. \nCUT TO: \n18      EXT. PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL - DAY \nA SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads: PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Beyond it squats an imposing four-story building.  Institutional brick. Barred windows.  About as inviting as KGB headquarters.  Security guards patrol the manicured grass. \n19      INT. HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING \nSunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall.  The room is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink, toilet, and a dented metal mirror.  WE HEAR a rhythmic grunting, small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time. \nPAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing outward.  A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg.  Tendons knot and release as SOMEONE does pull-ups.  A man of tangled hair hides the face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back. \nWIDER.  A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the top leg of the vertical bedframe.  Her body is straight and taut. Knees bent so the feet clear the ground.  The arms are lean and muscular.  The inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up.  Like a machine.  No change in rhythm. \n20      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR \nFIGURES MOVE TOWARD US down a corridor of polished tile and two- tone walls.  DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a smug criminal psychologist, leads a group of young INTERNS.  Following laconically, are THREE BURLY ATTENDANTS. \nSILBERMAN The next patient is a 29-year old female diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder. The usual indicators... depression, anxiety, violent acting-out, delusions of persecution. (the interns nod judiciously) Here we are. \nSilberman stops at one of the SOUNDPROOF STEEL DOORS.  There is a two- way speaker beneath a tiny window.  Silberman flips the intercom switch. \n21      INT. CELL \nSilberman's scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window.  HIS VOICE comes over the tinny speaker. \nTIM So she's pretty cool, huh? \nJOHN Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested. \nTIM No shit? \nJOHN Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say? \nJohn has tried to sound casual, but we see in his eyes that is really hurts.  He slaps Tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his Honda. John fires up and they whine off down the alley. \nCUT TO: \n26      INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY \nCLOSE ON COMPUTER TERMINAL, attached to the dash.  A Juvenile Division file.  Subject: John Connor.  Below his ARREST RECORD are his vital stats.  Mother: Sarah Connor.  Legal Guardians: Todd and Janelle Voight.  And below their names, an address: 523 S. Almond. Reseda, Ca. \nOFFICER X stares at the screen for a moment.  Then gets out the car. \n27      INT./EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE - DAY \nTIGHT ON FRONT DOOR as Todd Voight opens it, revealing the unsmiling face of Officer X beyond the screen door.  Todd greets him with a weary sigh. \nOFFICER X Are you the legal guardian of John Connor? \nTODD That's right, officer.  What's he done now? \nOfficer X ignores the question.  He casually scans the living room. \nOFFICER X Could I speak with him, please? \nTodd shrugs, showing the cop he's past his patience with the boy. \nTODD Well, you could if he was here.  Be he took off on his bike this morning.  Could be anywhere. You gonna tell me what his is about? \nOFFICER X I just need to ask him a few questions. \nJanelle appears in the doorway behind Todd, concerned. \nJANELLE There was a guy here this morning asking about him, too. \nTODD Yeah, big guy.  On a bike.  Has that got something to do with it? \nOfficer X registers the significance of that.  He realizes who the big guy must be.  He smiles.  Reassuringly shakes his head no. \nOFFICER X I wouldn't worry.  Do you have a photograph of John? \nTodd stares unhappily at the cop.  Turns to Janelle. \nTODD Get the album, Janelle. \nCUT TO: \n28      EXT. STREET \nANGLE THROUGH AN ALLEY from the main street.  We see John and Tim flash by on the Honda a block away.  Hold a beat.  Then... \nA BIG CHROME WHEEL ENTERS FRAME.  BOOM UP a leather-clad leg to Terminator's implacable face.  It surveys the area slowly as the bike idles, then kicks it into gear and moves on, scanning in a slow shark-like manner, not aware that it missed its prey by seconds. \nCUT TO: \n29      INT. SARAH'S CELL - DAY \nCLOSE ON SARAH.  She is shackled, hands and feet, to the bed. Sunlight falls across her pale face.  A hand enter frame, gently stroking her cheek.  She wakes up to see -- \nKYLE REESE.  Sitting on the edge of her bed, looking exactly the same as we last saw him in 1984.  Scruffy blonde hair and a long raincoat. \nSARAH Kyle..?  You're dead. \nHe gives her a gentle smile. \nREESE I know.  This is a dream, Sarah. \nSARAH Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff... \nHe puts a finger to her lips.  Then silently unfastens her restraints. They gaze into each other's eyes.  And in the look that his death and the horror she has been through since hasn't touched their love at all. \nSARAH Hold me. \nVIDEO SARAH You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him... (she gestures are the attendant) everybody... you're all fucking dead! \nShe is raving, half out of her chair.  The orderly moves to inject her with something. \nVIDEO SARAH You're the one living in a dream, Silberman, not me!  Because I know it happens.  It happens! \n31C     Silberman pauses the tape... freezing Sarah's contorted face. Real Sarah turns away from the screen, he expression stony. \nSARAH I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much better, now.  Clearer. \nSilberman gives a calculated paternal smile. \nSILBERMAN Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive lately. \nSarah looks up at him.  Her voice is hopeful. \nSARAH It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to. \nSILBERMAN And what it that? \nAs she answers, WE PULL BACK, revealing that we have been looking through a one-way mirror from an adjacent OBSERVATION ROOM.  In the shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the earlier rounds, and a couple of STAFF PSYCHOLOGISTS.  They smoke and make the occasional note. \nSARAH You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son. \nSILBERMAN I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist? \nCLOSE ON SARAH.  Her voice sounds hollow. \nSARAH They don't exist.  I see that now. \nSilberman leans back, studying her.  Toying with her. \nSILBERMAN But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press. \nSARAH If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory. \nSILBERMAN I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up? \nSarah shakes her head no. \nCUT TO: \n32      EXT. CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS - DAY \nThe corporate headquarters of a mega-electronic corporation.  As imposing cubist castle of black glass. \n33      INT. SECOND FLOOR/ELEVATORS \nThe elevator doors slide open with a whisper and MILES DYSON strides out.  Black.  In his early thirties.  The star of the Special Projects Division.  He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man with much to do. \nHe reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD through the scanner.  The door unlocks with a clunk. The sign next to the door reads: SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. \n34      INT. SECURITY STATION \nHe nods to the guards as he passes through the security checkpoint. They can see all activities on the floor on their bank of monitors. He unlocks another service door with his card and enters -- \n35      INT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (A.I.) LAB \nThe lab is quite large, comprising banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas.  Extremely high tech. \nDYSON Greetings, troops. \nHe is jokingly saluted by fellow members.  Not a lab coat in sight. This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright. They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as we know it.  A young LAB ASSISTANT rushes over to Dyson.  Name tag says he's BRYANT. \nBRYANT Mr. Dyson?  The material teams wants to run another test on the uh... on it. \nDYSON Yup.  Come on.  I'll get it. \nDyson produces an unusual-looking KEY from his pocket as they stride through the lab.  Bryant has to hustle to keep up. \nBRYANT Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven't been here that long, but I was wondering if you could tell me... I mean, if you know... \nDYSON Know what? \nBRYANT Well... where it came from. \nDYSON I asked them that question once.  Know what they told me?  Don't ask. \n43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning. He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like some hopeful guy with a hot date. \n43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise. \n43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool. \nTIM Some cop is scoping for you, dude. \nJohn looks around the corner of the \"Afterburner\" ride.  Sees the cop showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way. \nJohn ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news. \nTHE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him. \nJOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back. THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed. John breaks into run.  So does the cop. Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John. John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms. \n44      INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR \nJohn emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects to the parking garage.  He's running full out, when around the corner ahead of him comes... \nTERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses. \nSLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR'S BOOT crushes the flowers as it moves forward. \nJOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber, slow and fluid. \nJohn looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop is aiming his gun at him! John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he's screwed.  Then something crazy happens... \nTERMINATOR Get down. \nJohn instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM! \nTHE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he fires the pistol.  The pistol's shot goes wild. \nTERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another. Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING. Then silence. \nTHE COP lies still on his back. \n44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta. \n44B     The \"cop\", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human, pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol. \nON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody holes in the motorcycle jacket. \nJOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator's body has blocked the bullets. \nThe Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound. Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts walking toward the \"cop\". The empty magazine clatters to the floor. The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide. Terminator still has twenty feet to go. He doesn't break his purposeful stride. \nThe cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator's chest.  He doesn't even flinch. Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's wardrobe to shreds. \nCLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second. \nWe realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don't know the details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is). A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800 Series \"Arnold\").  This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a few surprises. \nT-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first. He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and disappeared. \nJOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage. \n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd. \n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run. \n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away. \nHe sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show. The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked. \n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE \nJohn is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see -- The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him. John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage. \nJohn looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000 is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street. \n46      EXT. STREET \nJohn shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK. The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck. \n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph. T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him, up ahead, weaving through traffic. \nJOHN Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem? \nStarts dragging John back to the bike.  John spots a couple of collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts yelling to them. \nJOHN Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this psycho off of me! \nThe TWO JOCKS start toward him.  John yells in outrage to Terminator. \nJOHN Let go of me!! \nTo his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on his butt. He looks up at the open hand. \nJOHN Oww!  Why'd you do that? \nTERMINATOR You told me to. \nJohn stares at him in amazement as he realizes... \nJOHN You have to do what I say?! \nTERMINATOR That is one of my mission parameters. \nJOHN Prove it... stand on one foot. \nTerminator expressionlessly lifts one leg. John grins.  He's the first on his block... \nJOHN Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great! \nThe two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark glasses, standing like a statue. \nFIRST JOCK Hey, kid.  You okay? \nJohn turns to him.  No longer needing to be rescued. \nJOHN Take a hike, bozo. \nFIRST JOCK Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit. \nJOHN Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?! (to Terminator) Grab this guy. \nTerminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar. the guy's legs are pinwheeling. \nJOHN Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag? \nImmediately, things get out of hand.  The guy's friend jumps behind Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson -- Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car -- Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead. John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger -- John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares, shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too. He screams at Terminator. \nJOHN Put the gun down!  NOW!! \nTerminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.  John scoops it up fast then turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened. \nJOHN Walk away. \nThey do.  Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back. \nJOHN Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! \nTERMINATOR Of course.  I'm a terminator. \nJohn stares at him.  Having your own terminator just became a little bit less fun to him. \nJOHN Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people! \nTERMINATOR Why? \nJOHN Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't! \nTERMINATOR Why? \nJOHN You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this. \nTerminator doesn't get it.  John just stares at him.  Frightened at what just almost happened.  He gets a glimpse of the responsibility that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator, who puts it away. \nJOHN Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come along, that's fine with me. \nCUT TO: \n58      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT \n250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement. Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his head, bouncing him off the linoleum.  Lights out, Douglas. She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys.  Then swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick. \n65B     Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet. She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police- style.  She looks dangerous. \nCUT TO: \n66      INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR \nA long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you in through a heavy door.  A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby.  She looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000) walking toward her. \nT-1000 You have a Sarah Connor here? \nShe assumes he's with the other cops.  Smiles. \nNIGHT NURSE Running late, aren't you? \nShe turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the cops coming toward the door from the other side. \nNIGHT NURSE Your friends are on their way out now... \nWhen she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there.  She goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird. \n66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard. The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the night desk.  Silberman faces him. \nSILBERMAN Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night. \nThe security guard nods.  Silberman goes back into the secure area of the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and the guard locks the door behind them. \n66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary. His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle. \n66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME.  An instant later the floor starts to move. It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard. \n66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working. The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip. Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD. \nT-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard. \nThe T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the \"liquid floor\" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard takes its first step. \n66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself. He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and, inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real guard's face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye. It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans- orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull. \nLife quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight, hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor. \n66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past, dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below the countertop. \nNIGHT NURSE Whatcha got, Lewis? \nT-1000/GUARD Just some trash. \nShe nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body into the utility closet. \n66G     INT. CORRIDOR/NIGHT RECEIVING DESK \nT-1000/Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse. \nT-1000/GUARD All set. \nShe glances toward it.  Sees the Beretta in its holster. \nNIGHT NURSE Gotta check the gun first, Lewis. \nT-1000/GUARD Yeah, sorry. \nT-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as it mimes putting the gun in. \n66H     CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker.  Instead of setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You'd ever guess it was really an intelligent liquid metal. \nT-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through. \nCUT TO: \n67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT \nA small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors. \nThe two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing SARAH CONNOR is in #19. \n67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn't glance twice at Lewis the Guard passing by. \nSARAH Down on the floor!  Now! \nThey comply.  She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding her hostage.  She's actually pulling this off. \n71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can't see, it a third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He's poised, ready to jump her when she comes abreast of him. \nON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner. The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand. Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs \nSILBERMAN Get her! \nThey scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner. One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound. \n72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol. Heads for the security entrance. \n73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies charge after her. She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door. Tries it.  Locked. Footsteps like a drum solo behind her. \nShe fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in. The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt. Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it. She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch on the other side.  He's too late. \nSarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys. \n73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond. She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door. She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked. \nShe flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her. She slams the bars shut.  CLANG. Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her. The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage. \nShe reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach. He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off. \nSarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies. They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the lock -- The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in. Silberman shouts at them. \nSILBERMAN Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!! \nThe orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor to another set of doors. \n73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead. Now she's home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she's nearly there when the elevator doors part... \nTERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her. Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares. Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward. Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor, staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun. \nShe loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity. She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be screaming if she could get the breath to do it. In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall. \nShe runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and figures out instantly what happened. \nJOHN Mom!!  Wait! \nSarah doesn't hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare. They take off running after Sarah. \n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle. She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two orderlies leap into the fray. \nSARAH No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!! \nShe is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don't even look where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor. \nThey have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her. Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare. She screams in utter hopelessness. \nTerminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the floor. The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder. Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys. Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine. One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an office door, splintering it into kindling. \nSilberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn't human. He feels the fabric of reality crumbling. Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him, then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a second. \nSarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her. John kneels next to her. \nJOHN Mom, are you okay? \nShe looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator. Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad? \nIncredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see. \nTERMINATOR Come with me if you want to live. \nThe orderlies are stirring. \nJOHN It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help. \nSarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers. Terminator lifts her to her feet. \n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the walls of bars.  John doesn't know what we know, but he knows something's not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow John's gaze. The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side. Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up. \n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn't stop. Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste forced past an obstacle. Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this. That faint snapping sound is his mind. There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap. \n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It's been a heavy day for her. Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the shotgun and starts backing up. \n81B     TERMINATOR'S POV.  A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as day. \n81C     Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone. \nTERMINATOR Everything. \nJOHN Cool. \nSarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is happening.  But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984. She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable. Then she turns to John in the back seat. \nSARAH You okay? \nHe nods.  She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him. She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones. \nHe pulls away from her.  He hates her always checking him, treating him like he might break, like some piece of rare china. \nJOHN I said I was okay. \nSarah looks at him, exasperated and stern. \nSARAH It was stupid of you to go there. \nJohn stares at her, surprised. \nSARAH Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than that.  You're too important!  You can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine. Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed. \nWe see his chin quiver.  He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is for her to love him.  He hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to be the man of steel she demands. \nJOHN I... had to get you out of the place... I'm sorry, I... \nHis face crumples.  He starts to cry.  Sarah gives him a cold stare. \nSARAH Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John. Other kids can afford to cry.  You can't. \nHe's trying to be brave, he really is.  Terminator turns and sees the water leaking from his eyes.  It doesn't make and sense to him. \nTERMINATOR What is wrong with your eyes? \nJohn turns away, ashamed.  Sarah lets her breath out, realizing how keyed up she is.  She turns to Terminator, giving him a wary once- over. \nSARAH So what's your story? \nCUT TO: \n82      EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL \nThe cops have shown up, as they always do.  There are black-and-whites everywhere, and ambulances are arriving.  Two cops and an orderly are required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman, who is raving at the top of his lungs. \nSILBERMAN ... it was all true and we're all going to die and the changed, I saw him change!! \nIt's quite pathetic. A nurse shoots him up with a sedative.  They lead him away. \n82A     T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops.  No one notices him. It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night. \n83      INT. CAR \nTerminator drives steadily into the black night. \nSARAH This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it? \nTERMINATOR Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds. \nSarah thinks about that.  Then: \nSARAH Can it be destroyed? \nTERMINATOR Unknown. \nThey ride along in silence for a few seconds. Sarah sees something up ahead, some lonely neon in the blackness. \nSARAH Pull in here.  We have to ditch this car. \n84      EXT. SERVICE STATION - NIGHT \nA rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around. They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office.  A sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS.  They continue around the building to the garage's back door. \nAT THE GARAGE DOOR.  Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up door and raises it.  Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight. Terminator rolls the door down behind them. \n89A     WIDER.  John walks around Terminator and looks at his face. Eyes open, he is completely inert.  Dead. \nJohn lifts his huge hand.  The dead servos whine sullenly as he forces them.  It's like rigor mortis.  He releases the hand and it stays in the lifted position.  Sarah examines the CPU chip. \nJOHN Can you see the pin switch? \nShe ignores him.  See looks at Terminator. The back at the chip. Then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer. John realizes what she is about to do.  Dives at her as the sledge is whistling down. \nJOHN No!!!! \nHe slaps his hand down over the chip. Sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers. \nSARAH Out of the way, John! \nJOHN No!  Don't kill him! \nSARAH It, John.  Not him.  It. \nJOHN Alright, it!  We need it! \nJohn keeps his hand right where it is. \nSARAH We're better off by ourselves. \nJOHN But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that. \nSARAH I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again. \nJOHN Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will. \nSmart kid.  He's got her.  She nods, reluctantly.  He palms the chip and studies it minutely. \n89B     John takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the other position. It is now in \"write\" mode.  Then he grimaces as he inserts the wafer back into the slot in Terminator's skull. \n89C     TERMINATOR VISION flares back to life in a burst of static.  The image forms.  Sarah and John stands behind him in the mirror. \nTERMINATOR Was there a problem? \nJohn glances sheepishly at Sarah,  Then smiles at Terminator. \nJOHN No problem.  None whatsoever. \nCUT TO: \n90      JOHN SLEEPING, lying on a pile of rags next to a stack of tires. The lights are off.  Sarah sits nearby, cross-legged, he back against the wall. The .45 is cradles in her lap.  She looks weary, but she won't allow herself to sleep with Terminator present. \nBy the office windows, in a slash of moonlight, is Terminator.  He stands silent and still, watching the night.  Only his eyes move, tracking with the occasional car passing on the road.  He figure silhouetted and still. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n91      SAME IMAGE.  Now DAYLIGHT streams in the dusty windows. Terminator has not moved.  Faithful machine sentinel.  He turns at a sound.  John stirs, waking up.  He squints into the sunlight.  Sarah is still awake.  She gets up, wincing at the pain in her arm. \nCUT TO: \n92      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY (LATER) \nJohn and Terminator walks to an old Chevy pickup parked behind the garage.  The day is clear but windy.  Dust devils chase themselves behind the place.  The pickup is locked but Terminator breaks the side window with his fist and opens the door.  He and John climb in. \n92A     IN THE PICKUP.  Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.  When it shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.  This starts the vehicle. It takes about three seconds. \nIn fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John flips down the sun visor.  A set of keys drops out and John catches them.  Dangles them in front of Terminator's eyes. \nJOHN Are we learning yet? \n92B     Sarah comes out.  She's found a mechanic's coverall inside, used but fairly clean.  It doesn't fit her too well, but it's better than the stuff from the hospital.  She's still barefoot. The sun, which she hasn't seen in months, hurts her eyes, Terminator and John pull up in the pickup.  She gets in. \n92C                             TERMINATOR We need to get as far from the city as possible. \nSARAH Just head south. \nCUT TO: \n93      INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/HIGHWAY - DAY \nTHE OPEN ROAD.  The pickup roars through light traffic down a long stretch of highway.  They set three abreast on the bench seat, John in between, like some improbable family on a car trip. Sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer. \nSARAH Keep it under sixty-five.  We can't afford to be pulled over. \nSECOND KID Am not! \nFIRST KID Are so! \nJohn and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the death.  Sarah rounds the front of the truck, and sees the kids.  John sighs, solemn.  He looks up at the cyborg. \nJOHN We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean. \nTERMINATOR It is in your nature to destroy yourselves. \nJohn nods, depressed. \nJOHN Yeah.  Drag, huh? \nSARAH I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible? \nTERMINATOR The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. \nSARAH Why him? \nTERMINATOR In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor. \nSARAH Then what? \n98B     Terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks. \nTERMINATOR In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record. \nSARAH (getting behind John) Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right? \nTERMINATOR Basically. (starting the engine, backing out) The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug. \nSARAH And Skynet fights back. \nThey accelerate back onto the highway. \nTERMINATOR Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia. \nSARAH Why attack Russia? \nTERMINATOR Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here. \nSARAH Jesus. (beat, then) How much do you know about Dyson? \nTERMINATOR I have detailed files. \nSARAH I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything. \n99      INT. DYSON HOUSE - DAY \nMiles Dyson sits at the huge desk in his study.  He is deep in thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal. Next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear.  On a Sunday morning, when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson is hard at work. \nIN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor. \nA WOMAN'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him.  He doesn't hear her.  His wife, TARISSA, extends her tongue and traces it down the back of his neck.  He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning. She's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee.  He's been up for hours. He turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is standing there. \nShe watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen. We see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box of his world. \nTARISSA You going to work all day? \nDYSON I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one... \nHe points to a metal box on his desk, about two feet long.  As assembly of small cubes.  It looks like a dinosaur version of Terminator's CPU. \nDYSON ... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies... \nTARISSA You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back. \nDYSON I can't \nTARISSA Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today. \nDYSON Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here. \nHe takes her hands.  We see a childlike excitement in his face.  He wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery, the satisfaction of creation. \nDYSON Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process -- \nSARAH Now, Enrique. (turns to Terminator and John) You two are on weapons detail. \nCUT TO: \nA103    EXT. COMPOUND/BEHIND THE TRAILERS \nThere is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the trailers.  John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand. \nJOHN Hook it on. \nTerminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the tractor.  John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads, pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate moves slowly under six inches of sand. \nJohn drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the ground.  Like the mouth of a tomb.  The kid drops down from the tractor and walks to the hole. \nJOHN One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead. \nA104    INT. WEAPONS CACHE \nFrom inside the \"tomb\".  Sunlight slashes down into a cinder-block room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long.  Sand spills down the steps.  The walls are lined with guns. \nJohn precedes Terminator into Sarah's weapons cache.  Rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, mortars, RPGs, radio gear.  At the far end, boxes containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling. Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.  He picks up a MAC-10 machine pistol.  Racks the bolt. \nTERMINATOR Excellent. \nJOHN Yeah, I thought you'd like this place. \nA105    EXT. COMPOUND/NEARBY \nSarah emerges from a trailer.  She has changed.  Boots, black fatigue pants, T-shirt.  Shades.  She looks hard. Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with Yolanda.  He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him, \nSALCEDA This is the best truck, but the water pump is blown.  You got the time to change it out? \nSARAH Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. (she pulls him away from Yolanda) Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get out tonight, too, okay? \nSALCEDA Yeah, Saralita.  Sure. (he grins) Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life. \nShe slaps him on the shoulder. \nCUT TO: \nA106    INT. WEAPONS CACHE \nTerminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo.  John is selecting rifles from a long rack. \nJOHN See, I grew up in places like this, so I just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow shit up. \nJohn grabs an AK-47 and racks the bolt with a practiced action. Inspects the receiver for wear.  Doesn't like what he sees.  Puts is back.  His movement are efficient.  Professional.  Uninterested. \nJOHN Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a regular school.  The other kids were, like, into Nintendo. \nTerminator has found a Vietnam-era \"blooper\" M-79 grenade launcher. A very crude but effective weapon.  He opens the breech and inspects the bore. \nJOHN Are you ever afraid? \nTerminator pauses for a second.  The thought never occurred to him. He searches him mind for the answer... \nTERMINATOR No. \nTerminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades. \nJOHN Not even of dying? \nTERMINATOR No. \nJOHN You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other? \nTERMINATOR No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter. \nJohn is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards and forwards like Bat Masteron. \nJOHN Yeah.  I have to stay functional too. (sing-songy) \"I'm too important\". \nTerminator pulls back a canvas tarp, revealing a squat, heavy weapon with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder.  Chain-ammo is fed from a canister sitting next to it.  A G.E. MINI-GUN.  The most fearsome anti-personnel weapon of the Vietnam era. Terminator hefts it.  Looks at John as if to say \"Can I?  Please?\" \nJOHN It's definitely you. \nCUT TO: \nA114    NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip. \nA115    ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking. She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty dog and loving it.  Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her hands.  Backlit, stylized.  She looks over at John.  Loading guns and supplies. \nA116    ANGLE ON kids playing. \nA117    SARAH'S HEAD droops.  She closes her eyes. \nA118    TIGHT ON small children playing.  Different ones. Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.  Very idyllic.  A dream playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides, and a jungle gym.  It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.  But here the grass is vibrant green and the sun is shining. \n118A    Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the playground.  An outsider.  Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers playing with their kids.  A grim-faced harbinger. \n118B    Some girls play skip-rope.  Their sing-song weaves through the random burbling laughter of the kids.  One of the young mothers walks her two-year-old son by the hands.  She is wearing a pink waitress uniform.  She turns to us, laughing. It is Sarah.  Beautiful.  Radiant.  Sarah from another life, uncontaminated by the dark future.  She glances at the strange woman beyond the fence. \n118C    Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.  She starts shouting at them in SLOW MOTION.  No sound comes from her mouth.  She grabs the fence in frustration, shaking it.  Screaming soundlessly. Waitress Sarah's smile falls.  Then returns as her little boy throws some sand at her.  She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the fence were a shadow, a trick of light. \n118D-118F  OMITTED \n118G    THE SKY EXPLODES.  The children ignite like match heads.  Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed. \n118H    THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children. Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips into her, blasting her apart and she... \n119     Wakes up. All is quiet and normal.  The children are still playing nearby.  Less than fifteen minutes have gone by. \nBathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table. Every muscle is shaking.  She is gasping. Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't escape from the madness which haunts her. \nShe looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.  They are:  \"NO FATE.\" Something changes in her eyes.  She slams her knife down in the table top, embedding it deeply in the words.  Then gets up suddenly and we -- \nCUT TO: \nA120    LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound with grim purpose.  She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15 assault rifle.  Her face is an impassive mask.  She has become a terminator. \nA120A   JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it.  She slams it in gear.  Salceda walks up to John. \nSALCEDA She said you go south with him... (he points at Terminator) ... tonight, like you planned.  She will meet you tomorrow in... \nBut John is moving, running after her. \nJOHN Mommm!! Wait!! \nA120B   MOVING WITH SARAH as she leaves the compound.  We see John running after her... yelling.  Can't hear his words.  She looks in the rear- view mirror but doesn't slow down. \nCUT TO: \nA121    EXT. COMPOUND - DUSK/MINUTES LATER \nJohn and Terminator ponders the message carved into the top of the picnic table.  Sarah's knife is still embedded there. \nJOHN \"No fate.\"  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes \"The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" \nTERMINATOR She intends to change the future somehow. \nJOHN I guess, yeah -- (snaps his fingers as it hit him) Oh shit!! \nTERMINATOR Dyson. \nJOHN Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away! \nJohn motions to Terminator and breaks into a run. \nJOHN Come on.  Let's go.  LET'S GO!! \nCUT TO: \nA122    INT./EXT. SARAH'S JEEP - DUSK \nSarah speeds through the darkening desert.  Expressionless.  In her dark glasses, she looks as pitiless as an insect. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA123    EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nTRACKING WITH THE BRONCO, Terminator and John heading toward L.A. \nTERMINATOR This is tactically dangerous. \nJOHN Drive faster. \nDYSON I think so, yeah.  When? \nDyson looks at her, Terminator, then John.  Sees his answer. \nDYSON Now? (he takes a breath) Yeah, right. \nHe turns to his wife.  Her face is streaked with tears, but her eyes are strong and clear.  Tarissa puts her hands on his arm.  She is stunned by what she's heard, but dealing with it.  She believe them. \nTARISSA Miles, I'm scared.  Okay.  But the only thing that scares me more than you going... is you not going. \nHe nods.  She's right. \nSARAH (to Terminator) Is it safe for them here? \nTERMINATOR (to Tarissa) Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack. (to the others) Let's go. \nCUT TO: \n138B    EXT, HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nPavement rushing at us, lit by headlights.  Beyond, darkness. \nSARAH (V.O.) The future, always so clear to me, has become like a black highway at night.  We were in uncharted territory now... making up history as we went along. \nTILT UP to reveal a rectangle of light ahead.  The Cyberdyne Building... \n139     INT. CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS BUILDING/LOBBY - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON A CARD-KEY SCANNER as Dyson's hand zips his security card through a slot in one motion.  There is the sound of a servo-lock, and -- \n139A    DYSON enter the spacious lobby, followed by Sarah, John, and Terminator last of all.  In a frontal angle, the others block Terminator from view. \nTHE GUARD at the front desk, GIBBONS, looks up as Dyson moves toward him.  Dyson is pale and sweaty, but smiles warmly at the guard, speaking well before he reaches the desk. \nDYSON Evening, Paul.  These are friends of mine from out of town, I just thought I'd take them up and show them around. \nGIBBONS I'm sorry, Mr. Dyson.  You know the rules about visitors in the lab.  I need written authoriz -- \nK-CHAK!  Gibbons is staring down the barrels of Sarah's .45 and Terminator's MAC-10. \nTERMINATOR I insist. \nThe guard is too stunned to move.  We see that Terminator is wearing his jacket and one black glove. Gibbon's eyes go to the silent alarm button on the console. \nSARAH Don't even think about it. \nGibbons nods.  He stays frozen.  Terminator circles quickly and gets the guard out of the chair.  John pulls a roll of duct-tape from his knapsack and tears off a piece. \n140     INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR \nELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and Terminator leads the group warily into the corridor.  They have a cart piled high with gear in nylon bags. Dyson motions down the corridor to the right.  As they walk, he continues to fill them in -- \nDYSON The vault needs two keys to open.  Mine... (holds up key) ... and one from the security station.  It's in a locker but my card should access it.  Here we go. \nThey stand in front of a wide security door.  A sign above reads SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION:  AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.  Dyson zips his key-card through the scanner and the door unlatches. \n141     OMITTED \n142     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/LOBBY \nA ROVING GUARD, MOSHIER, strolls down the long corridor from the first-floor office block.  A punch clock swings at his hip, and he's just completed his circuit of the building.  He passes the back of elevators and rounds the corner to the front desk, calling out -- \nMOSHIER Honey, I'm home... \nHe sees the desk is deserted and frowns.  Figures Gibbons must be in the can, so checks that first before getting alarmed. TRACKING WITH HIM to the restroom around the corner, \nMOSHIER Hey, man, you shouldn't leave the -- \n142A    OVER HIS SHOULDER we see past the door as he pushes it open, revealing Gibbons handcuffed to the urinal.  Moshier spins on a dime and sprints to the desk where he slams down on the silent alarm button. \n153     INT. SECURITY STATION \nThe security station is a pass-through area with a counter, behind which are desks and a bank of monitors, showing boring movies about empty corridors.  Dyson crosses quickly to a locker behind the monitor area.  He swished his card repeatedly through the scanner on the locker.  Nothing happens.  The light on the locker is blinking red.  Sarah notices Dyson's alarmed expression. \nDYSON What?  WHAT IS IT? \nDyson whips around, staring at a light flashing on the console behind him. \nDyson is lying amid the ruins of his dreams.  Sprawled on the floor, he has his back propped up against the desk.  He is bathed in his own blood, which runs out in long fingers across the tiles.  His breathing is shallow and raspy.  He still holds the book, trembling, above the switch. \nIn his lap is the picture from his desk.  He has pulled it from the debris next to him.  A tear trickles from his eye.  His wife and children smile up at him through broken glass. \n168     OMITTED \n169     CUT TO THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE, at the moment of death, the instant the light fade from his eyes and he is gone -- His arm drops and the book his the switch -- \n170     EXT. BUILDING \nAs the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire. Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky. The cops look up, stunned.  The helicopter banks away from the heat. Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers break ranks, pulling back. \n171     ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.  A BIKE COP who has just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward the building. \n171A    T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building.  It enters on the second floor, which is now a burning maze. \n172     INT. SECOND FLOOR/OFFICE/CORRIDOR \nT-1000 drives into the smoky wreckage.  It draws a Hoechler and Koch MPK machine pistol and cruises slowly into the firelit offices, scanning. \n172A    IN THE CORRIDOR the bike skirts flaming wreckage as it idles forward. T-1000 scans the leaping shadows for its prey. \n173     INT. GROUND FLOOR/ELEVATOR/LOBBY \nThe elevator doors part and Terminator eases a look out into the corridor.  The walls on either side of him ERUPT WITH BULLET HITS. The SWATs have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off.  They're totally trapped, cut off and screwed. \nJOHN (to Sarah) Don't forget.  It's always darkness right before... you're totally fucked. \n173A    The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators.  It spews the vicious CS gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops Sarah and John, who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator. \nTERMINATOR Keep your eyes closed.  Don't move. (they nod, eyes squeezed shut) I'll be back. \nHe slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into the corridor. \n173B    BLAM.  A tear-gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down the corridor.  It skids to rest in front of Terminator, throwing out a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor. 173C    In the elevator, Sarah and John are choking, handing the breathing mask back and forth desperately.  They're scarred.  This looks like it. 173D    ANGLE ON THE SWAT TEAM, gripping their weapons at the mouth of the corridor.  They watch the boiling cloud, waiting. \n173E    THEIR POV -- on the wall of boiling smoke.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Walking Totally unaffected.  Terminator emerges from the smoke.  Not even misty-eyed.  Not what they expected. \nLEADER (through megaphone) Stop where you are.  Lie down on the floor, face down.  Down on floor, now! \nHe continues to stride toward them. The SWATs tense up.  They've never seen anything like this.  They're not sure what to do.  Closer and closer. \nLEADER Drop him. \nThey OPEN FIRE.  The corridor is filled with CRACKING THUNDER.  The rounds tear into Terminator's chest.  Stomach.  Face.  Thighs.  His leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him.  The SWATs think the guy's wearing body armor or something.  They keep firing. The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps moving. \nLEADER You're not hitting him! \nSWAT #1 (getting scared) Yes I am! \nTerminator draws his .45 smoothly.  Unhurried.  He shoots the nearest man in the left thigh.  As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots him in the right thigh.  Terminator bends down and picks up the shrieking man's weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER. \nIt is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum. Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't penetrate.  But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full- swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles, gasping. \nTerminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters, revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest. \nThe remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and -- KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling. \n173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white- knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor, choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh. \nTerminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the smoke. \n174     EXT. BUILDING \nSmoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It is a total rout. \n175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist. \n175A    INT. SWAT VAN \nTerminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear. \n176     INT./EXT. LOBBY \nThe tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a roaring engine. \n176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he seals the corridor with the back of the van. \nWith the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving the pickup back and forth across the lanes. The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently. \nJOHN Faster!  He's right on us! \nTerminator doesn't reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still around his neck, and reaches for a grenade. \n191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens, filling frame with chrome and lights. \n191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding. \n191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail screeches along the other side. \nThe pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between the big-rig and the divider Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel. Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides. The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in. Metal and glass shower in through the side windows. The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being shaken right out of his teeth. The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind them. \n191C    INT. TANKER CAB \nT-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup. The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained hammering. \n191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP \nTerminator slides toward the passenger side.  Keeping his foot on the gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver's seat. \nTERMINATOR Drive for a minute. \nJOHN Where you going?! \nTerminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand. Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its frame.  It flies over the top of the truck. \n191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up. He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed. 191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream. \n191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like a pendulum behind the cab. \n191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards. Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen vapor.  It is gaining again. \nTerminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload. 191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP. \n191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES. \n191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES. The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts out, obscuring the whole front of the truck. \n191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back of the pickup.  Driving it right through the intersection at the bottom of the ramp, and straight toward -- \nEXT. STEEL MILL \nThe chase has led them to an area of heavy industry. \n192     THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup right through them.  Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier. \nJohn isn't even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There's nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant. \n192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup. He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and -- Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood. 192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. Right into T-1000's face. The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to SHUDDER AND 192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING. Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside. \n192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways across the pavement. It begins to topple. Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top. With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement. \n192E    John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building looming right in front.  The huge rolling doors are partly open. No choice. He steers right through them into the mill, as -- \n192F    Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab -- He flies through the open doors as -- The tanker hits the building and -- \n193     INT. STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE \nTerminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as -- The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o 193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230. \n193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are slammed forward, hard. \n193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across the floor. He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a massive machine. \n193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD. Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck. \n193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one elbow to survey the scene. \n193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees what they are running from... \n193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing vapor rolls down the center. \n193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen flows around its feet. \n194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it walks... \n204B    JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.  It is a cul-de- sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE. They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will decide their fate. \n204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would take to turn, the 204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the back of its head. 204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist almost to the elbow. \n204F    But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips Terminator's wrist, and the head \"emerges\" somewhere else, the geometry shifting faster than we can follow. 204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine. \nTerminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah and John. \nSarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He falls into a maze of pipes and girders. \n205     INT. MAZE OF MACHINES \nJOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap.  She could follow him but she doesn't.  SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him. John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches thick, slides toward him.  He rolls out of the way.  When he looks back, he cannot see the opening. \nJOHN Mom!  MOMMM!! \n206     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES \nTERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him.  Steel workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around.  He gets hold of the end and uses it as a lever.  With titanic effort he spreads the massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint. \n207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will have. She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the RIOT GUN and FIRES. \nA207    T-1000's face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her. She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but -- A208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her. The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye -- \nT-1000 Call to John.  Now. \n207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah. \n207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with fury. Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator falls back against the wall. \nBehind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear track. 207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the armor. The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again. Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the wall... The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified on a wall of machinery. The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in. He slides to the floor. \n207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward. \n207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl, feebly. Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His exposed machine eye burns red with determination. \nWe see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out for it as -- \n207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator's back, through a gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth, widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it down. It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator's chest. And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye. \nCUT TO: \n208     INT. MAZE OF MACHINERY \nJohn scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter.  Above him, vast machines churn untended.  He hears a voice... SARAH'S Calling low and urgent to him. \nSARAH John?  John?  Can you hear me?  Where are you? \n208A    He crawls out of the shadows. Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES.  Molten steel glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace.  Heat shimmers the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality. \nJohn sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him.  She can barely move, her leg bathed in blood.  He runs toward her. \nSARAH (gasping) Help me, honey... \nTIGHT ON SARAH, her stoic face, as she hobbles forward, reaching out to him.  Something rises behind her, OUT OF FOCUS. \n209     ANOTHER, IDENTICAL, SARAH... but this one has a shotgun. Aimed right at us. \n209A    JOHN freezes.  Which is which?  He looks down.  The first Sarah's feet are melded with the floor, sucking and fusing with the tiles as she walks.  They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the knee. \nSARAH John, get out of the way!! \nJOHN (screaming) SHOOT!!!! \n209B    John dives aside.  The Sarah-form spins, changing into you-know-who. Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it.  BOOM!  It staggers back. K-CHAK.  She chambers another round.  BOOM!  It staggers again. K-CHAK.  BOOM!  And again.  And again. \n209C    The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot. The craters in the T-1000's body \"heal\" slowly.  Its power is waning. She FIRES again.  And again.  Her eyes blazing with feral intensity. She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL. \nK-CHAK... CLICK.  She's empty.  The T-1000 is right at the edge.  In a second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly. She has failed.  Now it will kill them both, Except... \n210     CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, as the chain drive brings it into view. Half human flesh, half chrome steel. His red eye gazes right at us as he -- FIRES. \n210A    The T-1000 takes the round in the belly.  The grenade EXPLODES inside its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten steel and -- \n211     The T-1000's head and upper body reappear above the molten steel. It is screaming.  A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream. It is changing, morphing, transforming into anything and everything it's ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it -- We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames until they merge into one face -- \nThe T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel. We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing. \n", "test1_input": "John gives him an amazed look. \nJOHN This is deep. \n50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJohn and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness, Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up and back. \nJOHN So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you? \nTERMINATOR Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy. \nJOHN What does that mean? \nTERMINATOR Liquid metal. \nJOHN Radical. \nTERMINATOR You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever. \nJohn mulls that over. \nJOHN Where we going? \nTERMINATOR We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities. \nJOHN Can I stop by my house? \nTERMINATOR Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there. \nJOHN You sure? \nTERMINATOR I would. \nCUT TO: \n51      EXT. PAYPHONE \nJohn is quickly going through his pockets for change.  He has plenty of bills but no quarters. \nJOHN Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter? \nTerminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials. \n52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJanelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife. She answers sweetly. \nJANELLE Hello? \nJOHN (filtered through phone) Janelle?  It's me. \nIn the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at something. \nJANELLE John?  Where are you, honey?  It's late.  You should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole. \nAT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator. \nJOHN (whispering) Something's wrong.  She's never this nice. \nIN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen's back door. Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog's barking. \nTODD What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at? SHUT UP, YOU MUTT! \nTIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto the floor. (Don't go away.  We'll find out what happened in a moment) \nAT THE PAYPHONE \nJOHN The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already there.  What should I do? \nTerminator takes the phone from John's hand.  Janelle's voice is floating through the receiver. \nJANELLE (filtered) John?  John, are you okay? \nTerminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of John's voice... \nTERMINATOR (in John's voice) I'm right here.  I'm fine. (to John, a whisper) What's the dog's name? \n", "test1_true": "Terminator nods.  Speaks into the phone. \nTERMINATOR Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can hear him barking.  Is he okay? \nJANELLE (filtered) Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you? \nTerminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone.  Turns to John. \nTERMINATOR Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go. \nTerminator heads for the bike.  John, shocked, stares after him. \n53      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN \nJanelle hangs up the phone.  Her expression is neutral.  Calm. \nPAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are glassy and lifeless. \nThe spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP. 53A     Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and color, transforming back into a hand, and then... \n53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door. \n54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT \nT-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it, barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP. Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar. The tag reads \"MAX\". T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house. \n55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nDark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley, watching John pace before him.  John's brain is calling time-out. This is all too weird. \nJOHN I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches? \nTERMINATOR Anything it samples by physical contact. \nJohn thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters. \nJOHN Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes? \nTERMINATOR No.  Only an object of equal size. \nJohn's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems downright conventional next to the exotic new model. \nJOHN Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me? \nTERMINATOR It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes. \n56      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT \nT-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door.  The shower is running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor. \n56A     In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the dark. Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes marked \"Messages from Mom\".  In it are some letters, and envelopes filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the photos... \nSHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim. Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in the mountains. \n57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nJohn is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances down at John. \nJOHN We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that. (he looks up) But everything she said was true. (he stands) We gotta get her out of there. \nTERMINATOR Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her. \nJOHN Oh, great.  And what happens to her? \nTerminator's reply is matter-of-fact. \nTERMINATOR Typically, the subject being copied is terminated. \nJOHN TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now! \nTERMINATOR Negative.  She is not a mission priority. \nJOHN Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me! \nJohn strides away.  Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm. John struggles against the grip.  Which doesn't do him much good. \n", "test2_input": "135     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/STREET \nTerminator and John leap from the jeep, sprinting toward the house. The shots sound muffles from outside. \nJOHN Shit, we're too late! \n136     INT. HOUSE \nAdvancing with Sarah we enter the living area.  Tarissa has Blythe and she's screaming at Danny, who has run back to his collapsed father. \nTARISSA Danny!  DANNY! \nDANNY Daaaaddddeeee! \nDanny is pulling at Dyson, crying and screaming, as his father tries to stagger forward.  Tarissa drops Blythe and runs back for Dyson, grabbing him.  Sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed. \nSARAH Don't fucking move!  Don't FUCKING MOVE!! (she swings the gun on Tarissa) Get on the floor, bitch!  Now!!  Fucking down! NOW!! \nSarah is crazy-eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment. The kill has gone bad, with screaming kids and the wife involved... things she never figured on.  Tarissa drops to the knees, terrified as she looks into the muzzle of the gun.  Blythe runs to Dyson and hugs him, wailing. \nBLYTHE Don't hurt my father! \nSARAH (screaming) Shut up, kid!  Get out of the way!! \nDyson looks up, through his pain and incomprehension.  Why is this nightmare happening?  The black gun muzzle is a foot from his face. \nDYSON (gasping) Please... let... the kids... go... \nSARAH Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!! \nWe see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate this man she doesn't know.  It's a lot harder face-to-face.  She is bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes.  Blinking, she wipes it fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun.  The .45 is trembling. \nTIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes. She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny. Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract as she tenses to fire. But her finger won't do it. She lowers the gun very slowly.  It drops to her side in one hand. \nAll the breath and energy seems to go out of her. She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like \"Stay where you are, don't move\".  As if, should they move, the fragile balance might tip back the other way. She backs away from them slowly, panting.  It's as if she's backing away in terror from what she almost did.  She reaches a wall and slumps against it.  Slides down to her knees.  The gun falls limply from her fingers. She rests her cheek against the wall. \n136A    The front door is kicked in. Terminator steps inside.  John grabs his sleeve and pushes past him. He scopes out the situation in two seconds... Sarah, the gun, the sobbing family.  John moves to Sarah while Terminator checks Dyson. \nJohn kneels in front of his mother.  She raises her head to look at him.  He sees the tears spilling down her cheeks, \nJOHN Mom?  You okay? \nSARAH I couldn't... oh, God. (she seems to she him for the first time) You... came here... to stop me? \nJOHN Uh huh. \nShe reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly, surprising him... drawing him to her.  She hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside her, from a spring she had thought long dry.  She hugs him fiercely as the sobs wrack her. \nJohn clutches her shoulders.  It is all he ever wanted. \nJOHN It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out. \nSARAH I love you, John.  I always have. \nJOHN I know, Mom.  I know. \nTARISSA looks around at the bizarre tableau.  Terminator has wordlessly ripped open Dyson's shirt and examined the wound. \nTERMINATOR Clean penetration.  No shattered bone. Compression should control the loss of blood. \nHe takes Tarissa's hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and exit wounds. \nTERMINATOR Do you have bandages? \nDYSON In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us? \nDanny nods and runs down the hall. John disengages from Sarah.  She wipes her tears, the instinct to toughen up taking over again.  But the healing moment has had its effect, nevertheless. \nJohn walks toward Dyson and Terminator. \nDYSON Who are you people? \nJohn draws the Biker's knife from Terminator's boot.  Hands it to him. \nJOHN Show him. \nTerminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms. John takes Blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall, away from what is about to happen. \n", "test2_true": "TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip, leaving a bloody skeleton. \nBut the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne, \nHOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him. He's seen one of these before. Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn't hear her. \nDYSON My God. \nTERMINATOR Now listen to me very carefully. \n137     INT. HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER \nSarah puts out her fifth cigarette.  She's sitting on the counter. John, Terminator, Dyson, and Tarissa are at the kitchen table, under a single overhead light. \nDyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge.  His shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the harsh kitchen light.  TRACKING AROUND THE TABLE as Terminator speaks... we don't hear the words. \nSARAH (V.O.) Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all down.  Skynet.  Judgment Day... the history of things to come.  It's not every day you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths. He took it pretty well, considering... \nTerminator finishes speaking. \nDYSON I feel like I'M gonna throw up. \nHe looks around at them, clutching the table like he's about to blow away.  His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror.  This is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim world.  His voice is pleading. \nDYSON You're judging me on thing's I haven't even done yet.  Jesus.  How were we supposed to know? \nSarah speaks from the shadows behind them.  Dyson turns to find her looking right at him. \nSARAH Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards. \nJOHN Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue. (to the Dysons) She's still tense. (to Sarah) We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right? \nTARISSA But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes? \nDYSON (seizing on that) That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,, \nSARAH (coldly) That's not good enough. \nDyson's voice is pitiful. \nDYSON Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay? \nTERMINATOR No one must follow your work. \nDYSON (thoughts racing) Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care. \nCUT TO: \n138     FIRE ROARING IN A METAL TRASH BARREL. Stacks of files are dumped onto it. WIDER reveals we are in -- \n138A    EXT, DYSON'S BACKYARD - NIGHT \nTerminator dumps lighter fluid liberally over the fire, which flares up, lighting his face demonically.  Sarah, Dyson, Tarissa, and John return from his office with more stuff -- files, notes, optical disks. Even his kids are carrying stuff.  It all goes into the fire.  Dyson drops the prototype onto the fire... his eyes hollow and distant. \nHe stares into the fire, watching his world burning.  The has a sudden thought. \nDYSON Do you know about the chip? \nSARAH What chip? \nDYSON They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... (to Terminator) It's gotta be from the other one like you. \nTERMINATOR (to Sarah) The CPU from the first terminator. \nSARAH Son of a bitch, I knew it! \nDYSON They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know. \nSARAH Those lying motherfuckers! \nDYSON I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it. \nTERMINATOR I must be destroyed. \nSARAH (to Dyson) Can you get us in there, past security? \n", "test3_input": "DYSON I've worked for years on this thing. \nSwinging awkwardly but with great force he smashes the axe down onto the processor prototype, exploding it into fragments.  His shoulder is agony, but he looks satisfied. \n149     INT. SECOND FLOOR SECURITY STATION \nJohn taps away at his little lap-top, which is running code combinations into the card-key lock.  Suddenly, the green light on the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk. \nJOHN Easy money. \nHe whips it open, revealing a rack of keys.  But the VAULT-KEY is distinctive, a long steel rectangle on a neck-chain.  John grabs it and runs toward the lab. \n150     INT. LAB \nSarah and Terminator are working like a crack team, rigging the explosives.  She is taping the claymores to the gas cans with duct tape to create powerful incendiary bombs.  Terminator is attaching claymores and blocks of C-4 plastic explosive to the large MAINFRAME COMPUTER cabinets nearby.  All the claymores are wired back to one detonator with has a RADIO-CONTROL RELAY switch. \nDYSON How do you set them off? \nTerminator shows him a REMOTE DETONATOR, a small transmitter with a red plunger. \nTERMINATOR Radio remote. \nHe makes a plunger-pushing motion with his thumb and an accompanying \"click\" sound.  Dyson nods. Just then John comes running in, holding up the key. \nJOHN I got it.  Piece of cake. \nSARAH (to Dyson and Terminator) Go!  I'll finish here. \nThey run out as the SOUND OF SIRENS grow louder outside. \nTERMINATOR I'll deal with the police. \nJOHN Remember what I said, you can't... \nTERMINATOR Trust me. \n151     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING \nThe security duo of Moshier and Gibbons cowers behind cars in the parking lot in front of the building.  They turns as L.A.P.D. BLACK- AND-WHITES pour into the lot, turn the area into a disco of whirling blue and red lights. \n152     OMITTED \n153     EXT. CYBERDYNE BUILDING \nThe cops are jumping from their cars and ducking behind them. Emphasis on small arms here.  Behind them an ugly BLACK SWAT VAN screeches into the lot. \n153A    We hear the THUMP OF ROTORS as a POLICE CHOPPER arrives and swings in close to the building.  It rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the second floor offices. \n154     INT./EXT. SECOND FLOOR OFFICE \nTerminator crosses the office toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. He is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark offices.  Without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward the window. 154A    Glass explodes outward and the desk topples, falling to the sidewalk below. \n154B    Terminator, standing at the edge, FIRES A LONG BURST with strafes the police cars lines up below.  Cops duck as glass flies.  Terminator, with his superb aim, hits no one.  But noticed is served. \n154C    The cops (surprise) FIRE BACK.  Terminator turns and is walking calmly from the window as glass, office furniture, drapes etc. are riddled by return fire.  A few rounds hit his back, but he doesn't notice.  He reloads as he walks. \n155     INT. VAULT ANTECHAMBER \nTIGHT ON A KEY inserted into one of the vault locks. \nWIDER as John and Dyson stand poised, hands on keys. \nJOHN And let's see what's behind door number one. \nDyson nods and they turns the keys together.  The vault grumbles to itself, withdrawing it locking bolts with a final KLONK! Together Dyson and John swing the door open. \n156     EXT./INT. LOBBY \nThe varsity takes the field as the SWAT TROOPERS sprint forward by squads.  They flank the lobby and work their way inside, deploying rapidly.  They move and freeze, behind cover, quivering with adrenaline.  They have all that great SWAT equipment:  body armor, gas-masks, M-16s, tear-gas launchers, ropes.  The works.  They make a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut.  They're well- trained and deadly. \n157     OUTSIDE we see cops firing TEAR GAS grenades through the broken windows into second-floor offices. \n158     INT. VAULT \nJohn and Dyson are isolated from the world in this silent steel womb. Dyson opens the cabinet containing the terminator relics.  It's John turn to stare with uneasy deja-vu as he sees the terminator hand and CPU. \nThen in one vicious move he sweeps his arm behind the inert-gas flasks and hurls them to the floor.  They SHATTER.  John snatches the CPU and the metal hand out of the broken glass. \n", "test3_true": "Clutching the steel hand and pocketing the chip like it's a Mars bar he just bought, John runs out.  Dyson follows. \n159     INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL \nWe see the advance squad of SWATs make it to one of the stairwells. They start up, two at a time, covering each other ritualistically by the numbers. \n160     INT. LAB/HALL \nJohn pelts into the lab with Dyson stumbling along behind him. Sarah is just finished wiring all the charges to the central detonator. \nJOHN Ready to rock? \nSARAH Ready. \nJohn tosses her the metal hand.  She catches it and bends to put the hand in her empty back-pack.  Sarah zips the pack and starts to shuck into it. \nDyson's running out of steam.  The bandages at his shoulder are soaked with seeping blood.  He stands in the middle of the lab, saying goodbye in his mind, looking weak and empty. Terminator strides into the lab. \nTERMINATOR Time to go.  Right now. \nHe and John head back the way they came, through security. Sarah sees that in her work, she has set the detonator down twenty feet away, near where Dyson is standing. \nSARAH Dyson, hand me the detonator.  Let's go -- \nHe gingerly picks up the detonator.  Starts toward her.  Then -- 160A    CRASH!!  THE DOORS AT THE BACK END OF THE LAB ARE KICKED OPEN. SWAT LEADER  and two others OPEN FIRE. Their M-16s rake the room.  Sarah dives behind a computer cabinet. Dyson is HIT.  He is slammed to the floor by the impacts. \n161     IN THE HALL, John hears the firing and spins to run back. \nJOHN Mommm!!! \nTerminator grabs him as bullets slam into his broad back.  He makes it around the corner with John, out of the line of fire. \n162     IN THE LAB, bullets rake over Sarah's head, smacking all around her, clanging into the machine protecting her.  She can see Dyson, slumped on the floor.  Debris and flying glass rain on her as the SWATs pour on the fire.  The detonator is clutched in his hand.  He rolls to face her, his eyes bulging from the pain of his torn-up guts. \nDYSON Go. \n162A    Sarah hesitates a split second.  Then she snap-rolls and fast-crawls through broken glass and debris into the hall where -- \nTERMINATOR grabs her by the jacket and hauls her roughly to her feet. Bullets rake the walls behind them as they sprint forward.  They round the corner.  John does a fast take that she's not hit and they run together through the security checkpoint. \n163     INT. SECURITY STATION/CORRIDOR \nJohn reaches the first door, and tries it.  Locked. Terminator unslings the M-79 blooper smoothly, opening the breach. \nTERMINATOR Get back. \nHe pulls a grenade from the bandolier over his shoulder, and slides it into the bore.  Flick his wrist.  The breech snaps shut.  Sarah and John have a split second to duck and cover. \nTERMINATOR Cover you ears and open you mouth. \n163A    They do.  KABOOM!!! Twenty feet away the door, and half the wall around it, EXPLODES outward.  The backblast hits Terminator full force, but he strides through the smoking hole before the debris has even hit the floor. \n164     OMITTED \n165     INT. LAB \nSWAT LEADER moves cautiously through the lab.  Cat-stepping, he circles around a desk which block Dyson's body from his view.  His M-16 is leveled crisply.  We look over his shoulder as he rounds the desk, revealing -- \nMILES DYSON is not dead.  He will be very soon, but at this moment he is conscious.  He has propped himself up against the desk, and holds a BOOK in one hand.  A heavy technical manual. \nBelow the book is the detonator, upright on the tile floor. The message is clear.  \"Shoot me, the book drops on the plunger. Adios.\"  Dyson wheezes, trying to draw enough breath to talk. \nDYSON I don't know... how much longer... I can... hold this thing... \nSWAT Leader seems to see the wires, the claymores, the gas cans all around him for the first time.  His eyes, visible through his gas- mask, go very wide. He spins and motions his squad back. \nLEADER Fall back!!  Everybody out!  Move it!  OUT NOW! \nThey retreat so fast they crash into the next group coming up the stairs. \n166     INT. CORRIDOR \nTerminator reaches the main elevators.  Hits the button.  Sarah and John are coughing and stumbling in the choking darkness, buddy- breathing with the single mask.  The doors open.  They get in the elevator and head down. \n167     INT. LAB \n"}

They reach Rebecca's car. 
DULANEY Can I see you later? 
REBECCA You can see me now. 
Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around. 
Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in darkness. 
DULANEY What are you doing? 
She steps down and kisses him again.  For a moment he tries to resist. 
REBECCA I want you inside me. 
His desire fills him.  He pushes her back onto the hood of her car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down and unbuttons his pants. 
INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe and carrying a tea service on a tray.  He places it on the bed and sits beside him. 
REBECCA Something wrong? 
DULANEY Paley could be a problem tomorrow. 
REBECCA I'm sure you'll be able to handle him. 
DULANEY I'm glad you have such confidence in me. 
REBECCA Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out. 
DULANEY (sits up; very concerned) What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh? 
The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for asking such a question. 
DULANEY I'm sorry. (she doesn't look at him) Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really. 
He takes her hand.  She slowly looks at him and smiles.  She points to the tea service. 
REBECCA Sugar or honey? 
DULANEY Honey. 
She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the pleasure of his touch. 
INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the room.  Sharon is asleep.  Dulaney enters quietly.  He watches her.  He looks over at the nightstand. 
HIS POV 
A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation.  Dulaney is carrying her on a beach.  He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO.  They are both laughing. Dulaney looks back at Sharon.  He is a man lost within himself. He walks to the bathroom.  Sharon opens her eyes and stares at him. 
INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING 
Court is in session.  Cardenas stands. 
CARDENAS The State calls Doctor Alan Paley. 
Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand. 
CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

CARDENAS Where did you meet Miss Lawson? 
DR. PALEY At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.

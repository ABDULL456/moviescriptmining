Brigitte is using the vehicle's portable phone as she eyes the silhouettes of the family -still at the dining table - in the window above her. She stares at her watch during the following, 
911 OPERATOR (O/S) 911, do you need fire, ambulance or police, please. 
BRIGITTE (speaking very 
QUICKLY) Sam McDonald is not the Beast of Bailey Downs. He was at the Highway Home Motel when Trina Sinclair was killed. Sam didn't do it. 
Brigitte whips the phone shut, hanging up. She breathes out long and slow. 
BRIGITTE (V/O) In case this was the last thing I'd do. I wanned Sam out of it. Sam shouldn't suffer. 
INT. FITZGERALD DINING ROOM - LATER 
Brigitte hovers in the door way. Henry is reading the paper. 
HENRY That Sinclair girl was found at the Bernstein's, can you believe it? 
PAMELA What, last night? I didn't hear a thing! Never going to have these done in time. Henry help. Pamela is feverishly creating little straw witches and such party decorations. She has a se]ecl.i.on of dried flowers, wheat etc on the table before her. 
PAMELA Brigitte, honey we're thrilled you two are making friends. But next time you two do something like this give Mummy a little more notice, will you? Hate having to scramble. Brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction. 
HENRY What's your sister up to? Brigitte looks at Henry as he works on a little witch. 
PAMELA She said she had a lot of work to do on her costume. Should we dress up, you think? Henry grimaces. He sifts through the dried plants before them. Brigitte double-takes the pile. 
PAME-LA oh, Henry. You're no fun at all. 
Brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat. 
BRIGITTE What is this stuff? 
PAMELA Just weeds, old cuttings from the yard. 
BRIGITTE No, THIS stuff. Brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple flowers. 
PAMELA Oh, I had that around the dahlias. Man at the greenhouse said it'd keep the cats out. Seemed to do the job. It's got a funny name - nun's robe, priest hat, something 
BRIGITTE Monkshood. 
PAMELA That's right. Do we have a budding botanist in the family?! 
HENRY Pun intended. Pamela giggles as does Henry. Brigitte grabs a fistful of monkshood and races for the door. 
PAMELA Hey, we need that! Brigitte! But Brigitte is gone. 
PAMELA That was my accent colour! 
INT. BASEMENT PROPER - DUSK 
The half-finished basement has a rec room which Pamela has decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party. Punch sits ready next to case-lot pop and Tupperware brimming with snacks.

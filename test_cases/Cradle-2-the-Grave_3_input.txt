Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy. And Odion's eating it up. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via earwig mike -- FAIT Tommy. 
INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY 
Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform. TOMMY Here come da bug man. 
EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door. TOMMY Hey.    Howzit? DOORMAN What the hell you doing? TOMMY Pest control. Don't tell me you didn't get your notice. DOORMAN What notice? TOMMY See, that burns my ass right to the bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my job... Anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed. DOORMAN Yeah?    How come? TOMMY 'Cause foreign people're bringing all 
their scary-assed foreign bugs over here. Y'know, in their luggage and shit. And then the bugs're getting loose and fucking everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick... Anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread. DOORMAN We're doing business inside. Can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray. TOMMY Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it. DOORMAN Manager's busy. TOMMY ... Okay. Your call. Just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow. DOORMAN Quarantine people? TOMMY They'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... Peace out. Tommy starts to go. DOORMAN Wait, wait, wait. Tommy stops. DOORMAN City's really gonna come and close us up? TOMMY Quicker'n a Zip-loc. DOORMAN ... You sure you're not fucking with me? TOMMY I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why would I be fucking with you? The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then -- 
TOMMY Look. Let's do this. You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. How's that? The Doorman considers a moment.     Then -- DOORMAN ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and come on. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin. Odion's starting to salivate. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of the room. The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around in amazement. 
TOMMY ... Look.   At.   This. DOORMAN Just do your thing and go, bro. TOMMY Roger that. He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes -- TOMMY Just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in. OFF the closing door...

His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl. 
GEKKO (CONT'D) It's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done. You got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors. Present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes. Only there aren't enough to go around. Management has them. You don't. If they throw Bluestar into Chapter 11--which I think they will--then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property. 
We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a roll, glaring at Gekko. 
WILMORE (pilot) With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing? 
GEKKO Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut. 
Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on. 
GEKKO And seven more hours a month. 
Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks. 
CARPENTER What kind of time frame are we talking about here? 
GEKKO Give me a year. If we're still losing money, the reductions stand. If however, we move into the black, I return part of the givebacks, salaries go back to present levels, and... (a beat) we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock. You'll own part of the airline. 
Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back. 
WILMORE Are you prepared to put that in writing? 
GEKKO I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days. 
CARPENTER What's your marketing strategy? How do you plan to return us to profitability? 
GEKKO Why don't I give Bud an opportunity to answer that. 
Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass. BUD Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I want you to know my door will always be open to you cause I know from my Dad it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize. Our computer software is weak, we update it, we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown. You don't sell a seat to a guy for $89 when he's willing to pay $389. Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war. Two -- Advertising -- more, more, and aggressive, attack the majors. Three -- expand our hubs to Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas, reorganize all our feeder schedules, think Big -- guys, we're going after the majors! 
The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination. 
GEKKO (looking for reactions) Cards are on the table. What do you think? 
WILMORE (restrained, hopeful) If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people. 
CARPENTER (approvingly) You've sketched some broad strokes. I'd like to see the fine print. But so far so good. 
Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence. 
CARL I guess if a man lives long enough, he gets to see everything. And I mean everything. What else do you have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko? 
Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly. 
GEKKO Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen. 
CARL There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know. 
GEKKO (smiling) I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb? 
CARL (smiling) No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions. (looking at Wilmore and Carpenter) I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ... 
BUD Now, wait a minute, Dad... 
GEKKO (shrugs, keeping his composure) Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain. 
Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at the others. 
CARL (looks at Bud) 'Course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader. With those qualifications, why should I doubt his ability to run an airline? 
There is frozen silence at the table. 
GEKKO Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground. 
CARL ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day... 
Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his piercing look. He hurries after his father. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering him. 
BUD (seething) Congratulations. You did a great job of embarrassing me in there-- not to mention yourself! Save the "workers of the world unite" speech for next time Dad, I heard it too much growing up. You're gonna get axed Dad, no two ways about it, you and the whole airline are going down the tubes, you hear me, just like Braniff, you don't have a chance in hell, and if it isn't Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

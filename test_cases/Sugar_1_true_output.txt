Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment. 
He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles. His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM. 
Miguel smiles. 
AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a Metrocard vending machine nearby. 
178   AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER                                    178 
Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches and BEEPS, he's got his card. 
179   AT THE TURNSTILE                                                  179 
He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile won't budge. He studies the message: "SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS TURNSTILE", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again, this time very slowly, but still can't get through. 
An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly. 
Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass. 
After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again. 
180   INT. SUBWAY PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL                                     180 
As Miguel strolls through the underground hallway that connects the various Times Square subway lines, he sees... 
--a TEAM OF BREAKDANCERS performing for tips. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   89. 
--billboard ads for movies, music, dermatologists, Mets baseball, etc. 
--a HOMELESS MAN passed out on the ground. 
--a WOMAN selling a random collection of objects: VHS tapes, batteries, a used blender... 
181   INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - MOVING                                        181 
Miguel observes other passengers, when the train emerges above ground. He stands, looks out the window as the train passes Yankee Stadium. 
182   EXT. 167TH ST. - THE BRONX     - DAY                              182 
Miguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others. 
Miguel paces up the block, looking for something.    He smiles when he finds... 
...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and Spanish) hangs in the window. 
183   INT. EL RESTAURANTE CARIBE - DAY                                  183 
Miguel takes a seat at the counter, smiles to the waitress, REYNA (cute, 20-something, Dominican). 
REYNA (in Spanish, of course) Talk to me. 
MIGUEL Is Jorge working today? 
REYNA Jorge? 
MIGUEL Jorge Ramirez. 
A bus boy, RAFAEL, overhears as he passes by. 
RAFAEL Jorge, the ball player! 
MIGUEL Yeah! 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   90. 
REYNA Oh. The ballpayer... He left about two weeks ago. 
RAFAEL I think he drives a car now. 
MIGUEL Do you have a phone number for him? His old one isn't working. 
Reyna shrugs, looks to Rafael. 
RAFAEL (shaking his head) Sorry... But I think he was staying down at concourse village on 156th. 
REYNA He still comes in to eat sometimes. 
Miguel nods, looks off, a little anxious. 
184   EXT. 156TH STREET - DAY                                         184 
Miguel glances up at the dozens of high-rise apartment buildings in every direction. 
He walks away, discouraged. 
185   OMITTED                                                         185 
186   EXT. (ANOTHER) STREET - DAY                                     186 
Miguel continues to follow the elevated subway tracks, which lead him straight to... 
...YANKEE STADIUM. He looks up at the park's grand exterior with wonder. Approaches to get a closer look. 
The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a glimpse of the field through an iron fence. He grabs hold of the bars, attempts to climb just enough to get a better view, but...

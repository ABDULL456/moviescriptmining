An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial. He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel. Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel and looks at her. She appears to be dead.

Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to loosen.

ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.

CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the trap door in tact.

ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream- ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on the ground. 
ASHLY 
Stay back. 
His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA advances toward him, laughing. 
ASHLY 
Linda please, if you can still hear me. Keep away. 
His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream, she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk- ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls. He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin.

Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body. 
ASHLY 
Oh..... 
It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut. A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the rifle again and cautiously moves to the door. 
92   IN - S.B. 
He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him. He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL backs away and spots the open front door.

SERGEANT What's the charge? 
OFFICER Assault with a deadly weapon. 
JIM Listen-- 
SERGEANT (annoyed) He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you? 
JIM My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here. 
SERGEANT Come back tomorrow. 
JIM I'll wait for him. 
SERGEANT Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? (to hoodlum) Ever been booked before? 
JIM turns away, notices a phone on the wall--puts in a coin, asks for a number. 
Bedroom of JUDY's parents.  Through an open door we hear a radio playing-- a late disc-jockey show for teenagers in which numbers are dedicated by request.  JUDY'S MOTHER and FATHER are in bed, FATHER has phone in his hand. 
JUDY'S FATHER Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who? Never heard of you. 
He hangs up phone, looks at his wife.  She rolls over in bed. The FATHER turns off the bed lamp, then sits up, worried in the dark. 
JUDY's bedroom.  It is her radio we have heard.  She turns off light, opens the door a crack, and looks out toward her parent's room. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Traveling shot.  PLATO.  He is coming up the walk to his house.  When PLATO has come a few feet, somebody whistles. PLATO and camera stop.  Short, quiet whistles come from the boxwood and shrubbery on both sides of the walk.  PLATO turns and starts to run, camera following.  He gets to his door, tries the key, but in his panic it will not go into the lock.  Suddenly a hand reaches in and jerks him around. CRUNCH stands above him.  GOON closes in from the other side. All very tense and hotted up! 
PLATO What do you want! 
CRUNCH You know what we want.  We want your friend. 
GOON We got eyes for him. 
PLATO Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops are cruising every-- 
GOON Where does he live? 
PLATO reaches up swiftly and rings the bell.  GOON grabs him. CRUNCH cracks him. 
CRUNCH You better tell us and I'm not kidding. 
PLATO My old man's got a gun. 
GOON His old man's got a gun.  What do you think of that! (drives a hard blow at PLATO's belly) Your friend talked-- (belts him again) Now you talk!  Talk! 
The door opens and the NEGRO WOMAN is there.  CRUNCH sends PLATO spinning into the house past her.  He falls. 
NEGRO WOMAN (yelling) What you doing!  What you doing to him!  You clear out of here 'fore I call the police! 
She swings at CRUNCH who faces her, challenging. 
NEGRO WOMAN Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now! 
MOOSE Let's go, Crunch. 
They turn and move past camera.  PLATO gets up off the floor. We hear the sound of a heap starting.  The NEGRO WOMAN closes the door. 
Inside PLATO's foyer as NEGRO WOMAN bolts the door. 
NEGRO WOMAN Why you like to mix with bad boys like that?  Why you get in trouble all the-- 
PLATO I have to go out.  I have to warn him. 
He starts up the stairs.  She follows him heavily. 
NEGRO WOMAN You not going anywhere!  You staying home while your mama's away. 
Bedroom of PLATO's mother, a lacy affair with imported dolls on the pillows.  PLATO rushes in, opens the drawer of the night-table and pulls out a gun.  He checks to see that it is loaded.  The NEGRO WOMAN appears in the door and stares at him, turns on the light which illuminates the bed-lamp. 
NEGRO WOMAN John!  What you doing with that! You leave that be!  Put it down before you hurt yourself.  Hear me? 
But PLATO moves past her and out of the room.  She turns after him.

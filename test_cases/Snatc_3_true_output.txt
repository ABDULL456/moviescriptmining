I hope we gonna get a better show this time. 
BRICK TOP 
This will make up for it.     Micky's going down in the fourth.     Terry over there is in charge of   the bets. Now you'll have to forgive   me. Brick Top leaves with Ken. 
BRICK TOP (CONT'D) 
Have we got the lads at the- camp site? 
(CONTINUED) 
118   CONTINUED: 
KEN 
Yeah they are there. Cut to a shot of some of Brick Top's heavies waiting in a car outside the campsite. 
BRICK TOP 
Where's that fuckin pikey? 
119   INT. BACK OF WAREHOUSE 
Brick Top is standing in front of Micky whose eyes are still semi open. 
BRICK TOP 
What's wrong with you? You stoned? Is he fuckin stoned? 
TURKISH            .   - 
He's like that before a fight. He turns his attention to Micky. 
BRICK TOP 
Now you know when you're going down? 
TURKISH 
Of course he knows when he's going down. 
KEN 
Hey fuck face, who's speaking to you? He asked him didn't he? 
TURKISH 
Fuck face? I like that, I ' l l have to use that one next time -I want to impress your mum Ken. 
MICKY 
The fourth... or was it the fifth.. 
BRICK TOP 
There's a campsite full of pikies that might not think you're so fuckin funny when they 'are putting the flames out on their children's backs. Cut to a shot of Brick Top's boys lighting a cigarette in the car outside the pikies. 
120   INT. WAREHOUSE 
Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse. He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON. 
THE REFF 
Alright lads no eye gouging no biting. Do your worst. Back to your corners. 
We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white, Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night" eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward, after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious onslaught. 
TURKISH 
I don't like the look of this Tommy, bring the van up to the back door. This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him back to his corner. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
They are on ya. You got to hurt him Micky. Otherwise we are rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do -something, it looks like it' s rigged. Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low, BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up. 
(CONTINUED) 
120   CONTINUED:    - 
BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s made out of water. He falls through the water like he's sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky 1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi- conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten, Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "Good Night" on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody is in trouble. 
Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties. 
TURKISH (CONT'D) 
Tommy get the van. 
TOMMY 
I have it, it's waiting. Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky. 
TURKISH 
We are off Micky, hold tight, and move quickly. , Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his mobile telephone. It rings. 
121   EXT. CARAVAN, PIKEY CAMPSITE 
Darren picks up the phone. 
DAREN      . 
If you would you like to speak to your friends, you'll have to speak a little -louder. 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED: 
We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone down. 
BRICK TOP 
Right lets get outta here. Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out of there, accompanied by Ken. 
BRICK TOP (CONT.'D) 
Where's the car Ken? 
KEN 
I t ' s coming now. 
BRICK TOP

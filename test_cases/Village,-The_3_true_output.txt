Lucius:  I am not the one with secrets. 
Alice:  What is your meaning? 
Lucius:  There are secrets of every corner of this village.  Do you not feel it?  Do you not see it? 
He points at the black box in the corner of the living room. 
Alice:  That is for my own well-being, so the evil things from my past are kept close and not forgotten.  Forgetting would be to let them be born again in another form. 
Lucius (standing):  Then let us open it. 
Alice (final):  No.  Perhaps we should speak with Edward Walker together.  He may be able- 
Lucius:  He hides, too.  He hides his feelings for you. 
Alice:  Oh! 
Exasperated and startled, she turns and walks to her bedroom.  He follows her. 
Lucius:  Sometimes, we don't do things, yet others know we want to do things, so we don't do them. 
Realizing he bungled that statement badly, he hangs his head a bit and makes a sort of "oh, darn!" motion with his hand.  Alice returns to her bedroom door. 
Alice:  What nonsense are you saying? 
Lucius:  You needent worry.  Nothing will happen to me.

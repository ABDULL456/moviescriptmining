SCOTTY comes back in room feeling better. 
SCOTTY Man, that one made me puke! 
MOM (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist camp magazine and handing it back to him like it's poison) You forgot something... 
SCOTTY (Looking around confused) Are we leaving? 
MOM Yes you are. 
SCOTTY guiltily takes back magazine as BIRDIE drags him out. 
BIRDIE Bye, Mrs, Sutphin. 
CHIP (Affectionately) Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty. 
MOM Bye, Birdie. (Sitting down next to CHIP on his bed) Chip, honey...I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand.. I'm your mother and I love you. 
CHIP Oh Mom... 
MOM (Suddenly his buddy) Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart? (Giggling scarily) PLEEEASE? 
CHIP looks back at his MOM in sudden confusion. 
24.    SUTPHIN KITCHEN. 
SPIN-WIPE to tomato sauce topped meatloaf being taken out of the oven by MOM.  Subtitle appears "6:30pm" and fades out. 
25.    SUTPHIN DINING ROOM. 
DAD, MISTY and CHIP sit around dining room table. MOM enters with the meatloaf and a smile. 
MOM (Jokingly) Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf! 
CHIP Looks good, Mom! 
DAD Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey. 
MOM Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... (Passes it to her) 
MISTY Yummy.  Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer. 
MOM (Appalled) Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know. 
CHIP Carl's a jerk! 
DAD He certainly drives like a jerk. 
MISTY (Getting upset) Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it? 
DAD Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy. 
MOM I'm happy too and we want you to be happy. 
CHIP (Mockingly) I'm so happy I could shit. 
MOM CHIP!  You know how much I hate the brown word! 
Suddenly a scream from outside is heard. 
26.    EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE. 
ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, the busy-body next door neighbor is running across lawn from her house to the Sutphins. 
MRS. ACKERMAN Beverly!  Beverly!

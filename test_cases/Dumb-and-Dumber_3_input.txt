HARRY Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both. 
HELEN I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to meet. 
HARRY (taken aback) You were? 
HELEN That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary. 
Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry. 
HARRY Really? 
For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh? 
MARY Helen, you're embarrassing me. 
HELEN Well you are, aren't you? (to Harry) Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you available? 
Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd. 
HARRY Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball. 
Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer. 
HARRY (CONT'D) Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure. 
ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns. 
LLOYD How come you didn't call me over? 
HARRY Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow. 
Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS. 
LLOYD Wha... you... I... it's... (smiles) I love you, man. I love you! 
Lloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE. 
HARRY Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene. 
Lloyd steps back elated. 
LLOYD This calls for a toast! 
He grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it. 
LLOYD (CONT'D) You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal. 
Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND ZIPS ACROSS 
THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN WIDER- 
EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP! 
A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage. 
THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW 
Owls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to extinction. 
Harry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar. 
HARRY (under breath) I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd. 
The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while J.P. Shay looks on nervously. 
J.P. SHAY Maybe it was just a coincidence. 
ANDRE Don't be stupid. It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours. 
J.P. SHAY But how could anybody off a bird with a cork? 
ANDRE These guys arent' just anybody. They're good. Look what they did to Mental. He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web. 
J.P. SHAY But the bastards already got our money. What the hell more could they want? 
Andre runs his fingers through his hair.

GEORGE We've got to do something about this. 
INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA 
George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge wall safe.  Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard.  The Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the proceedings. 
GEORGE Are you comfortable with this? 
DIEGO George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. 
GEORGE And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks. 
DIEGO Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us? 
INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY 
George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president congratulates them and hands them documentation. 
GEORGE I love it. 
BANK PRESIDENT I'm sorry. 
GEORGE I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book.

Diego and Inez's wedding.  The ceremony.  The ring.  The kiss.  The lineup with all of the bridesmaids.  George is the best man, and the only American. 
INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly throws his arm around George's shoulder. 
DIEGO I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George? 
GEORGE You're a lucky man, Diego. 
DIEGO I love you, my brother, do you know that? 
GEORGE I love you too, man. 
George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I'll be right back, Diego. 
INEZ Look, honey, a power boat. 
DIEGO Great, baby, great! 
They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly towards Mirtha. 
GEORGE Hello. 
MIRTHA Hello. 
GEORGE Do I know you? 
MIRTHA I don't think so. 
GEORGE Why are you smiling? 
MIRTHA Why are you smiling? 
GEORGE I don't know.  My name is George. 
MIRTHA I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George. 
GEORGE What is your name? 
Cesar arrives. 
CESAR Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee, Mirtha. 
He kisses her. 
GEORGE Mirtha. 
CESAR Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito. 
They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

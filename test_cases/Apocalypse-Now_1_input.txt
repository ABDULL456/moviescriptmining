The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de- bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R. 
CHIEF (to Willard) I can't see a fucking thing. 
There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard climbs forward, and looks down. 
CHIEF (continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette. Fucking plastic boat. 
Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole, warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean joins him, helping. 
WILLARD (shouting to Chief) What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down? 
CHIEF Who knows what's up there? 
WILLARD Can't be any worse than this. What do you think? 
CHIEF I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse. 
Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary. 
WILLARD Well, get in there. 
CHIEF This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes. 
There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks. 
WILLARD Get in there ! 
CHIEF This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. 
WILLARD Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river. 
It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't do as he says. 
CHIEF (finally relents, turns the helm) You're fucking crazy. You're going to get us all killed. 
The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary.

136  EXT. THE TRIBUTARY - P.B.R. - RAIN 
Rain is pouring down, but the P.B.R. is slowed down to a snail's pace by Hyacinths, literally across the waterway. 
Willard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through them with machetes.

cutting through. he looks to Chef, who has stopped cut- ting, and is staring into the jungle. 
WILLARD What do you see? 
CHEF I don't know. 
He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark and high -- totally impenetrable. 
WILLARD Keep cutting. 
They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong. 
139  VIEW ON CHEF 
cutting with all he's got. 
CHEF I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us. 
WILLARD Probably is. 
CHEF Whatdoya think it thinks. 
WILLARD That we're dumber than we look. 
Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them. It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later. 
Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon. 
CHIEF Lance -- 'bout twenty meters starboard. 
Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free. 
CHEF There in the trees ! 
Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

Lance's twin guns return the FIRE. The Chief moves to one of the heavy guns and joins Lance in returning the FIRE.

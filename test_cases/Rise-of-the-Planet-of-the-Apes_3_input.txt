INT. LAB - DAY 
DONNIE She's breaking my hand! 
CAROLINE Let go, Bright Eyes! You're hurting him! She tries to help pull Donnie away. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Let go! In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own. 
LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND 
THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY. 
HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH. 
FRANKLIN Lucky no! Stop! 
(TO CAROLINE) Hit the alarm! Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it. 
DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO... 
INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME 
LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he scampers - unattended - down the hall. 
GUARD #1 Uh oh. Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN 
SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO 
GET HIM FREE. 
GUARD #2 Hey, Len...? Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket... Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet... 
EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY 
Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest building. 
INT. BOARDROOM - DAY 
The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's pronouncement. 
BOARD MEMBER What about the safety of the virus? 
WILL Perfectly safe. We're using the most stable - A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS. Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW. 
WILL (CONT'D) 
NO! Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and pinning him to the wall. It happens fast. The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY 
INCISORS... â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK. The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again. 
Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams - collapses on the boardroom table. 
EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS. Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder packed in ice. He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him. 
WILL Are they gone? 
JACOBS Long gone. Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway. 
WILL Did they say anything before they left? I mean, about Phase 2. 
JACOBS Look around you, for Christ sakes. We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail. Will's gutted - devastated. 
WILL But we're so close. 
JACOBS You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here? I've got my own skin in this game! 
WILL What happened had nothing to do with the 112. (desperate to clarify) Take an already aggressive animal, make it smarter - you're going to get a potentially dangerous 
SITUATION -

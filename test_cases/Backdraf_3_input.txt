JACKSON Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin' stupid can a guy get? 
Stephen suddenly PUNCHES Jackson. 
STEPHEN You can't talk about my brother like that... 
HELEN (sighs) Here we go... 
And Stephen PLOWS into Jackson. Another fireman JUMPS to Jackson's aid. And Brian's there, defending his brother, PUNCHING OUT a fireman. The crowd finally pulls the two apart. 
JACKSON You're crazy, man! 
STEPHEN Leave me alone! 
AXE Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off! (Stephen calms a little) You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life? 
STEPHEN No. (beat) I need a drink. 
Stephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and JUMPS Jackson again. Brian pulls him off and drags him for the door. 
BRIAN You don't need a drink, man. You need to get outta here... 
As Jennifer watches Brian lead Stephen out the door. 
JENNIFER (to Swayzak) Ah those McCaffreys... just hate leaving a party with anyone left standing... 
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Brian leads Stephen toward his car. 
STEPHEN I'm okay... leave me alone... 
Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the sidewalk. 
BRIAN So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what? 
STEPHEN Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know? 
Brian stands there and folds his arms. 
STEPHEN I don't think I can get up. 
Brian lends an arm. 
STEPHEN Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too. 
BRIAN C'mon, let's crawl home. 
EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT 
Stephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him up onto the boat. 
STEPHEN ...Adcox, those guys...they don't get it... it isn't the goddamn promotion... or dad... I'm not my old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get me... I don't give a shit about being a captain... it's just... it's just they don't trust me anymore... (blows out painful breath) ...they don't trust me anymore... 
INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT 
Brian's flops his brother on the bed. Unties his shoes. 
STEPHEN If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. I could take my own goddamn shoes off... 
He clearly can't. Brian slips them off. 
STEPHEN You're such a pain in the ass... You've always been a pain in the ass... 
There's just a grim wall lamp above Stephen's face. 
STEPHEN Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind... 
BRIAN (touching light) This? 
STEPHEN Yeah... too bright... 
Brian turns off the dim light. Stephen's breathing deepens. 
STEPHEN They don't know... they don't know what I hear in there... 
Brian tucks the blanket around him. 
STEPHEN ...This boat could be okay, huh?... Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me... 
Stephen's voice drifts off into sleep. Brian watches a moment, the rare look of peace on his brother's face, then leaves. 
EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - NIGHT 
Dark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the chain link. 
EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - EXERCISE GROUND - NIGHT 
Is a practice stand-pipe. Brian counts down to himself, then rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant wrench and attaching the hose coupling. He does it again, over and over. 
EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - DAWN

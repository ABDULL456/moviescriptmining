{"test1_input": "A chanting CHIEF PRIEST leans in close to Agu's face. THREE INITIATORS inscribe messages from the Koran with black ink on wooden tablets. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) The rains are coming, Gentlemen. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nCOMMANDANT You are knowing what that is meaning. Mosquitoes, sickness, muddy squalor. Suffering if we are caught with our \"soldiers\" hanging out. \nThe men laugh at the \"penis\" allusion, but they know the rains mean change. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nTWO-I-C ...the Junta will tell the international community that we NDF are the reason this war continues. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT You, Hope, and you, Rambo, you are not from the same tribe as him. (he points towards Hope) But you are brothers before your enemy. \nHope, Rambo and the troops hum in agreement. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) What drove us to this larger family of strangers? Fear? \nHOPE No, sah. \nCOMMANDANT War? \nRAMBO Yes, Sah! \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu is perplexed by Two-I-C's explanations, the politics are beyond his understandings of the world. \nTWO-I-C The PLF could join the NRC, it would legitimize their cause, make us the sole enemy, and give them freedom to roam formerly Government controlled areas of the nation in policing actions. If this were... \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu is swept away with Commandant, the spectacle, the reactions from the other soldiers he enjoys. \nCOMMANDANT We have defended ourselves against criminal rapings and killings of our own people, first by the PLF, and now by the NRC government. \nThe men grow dark with this thought. Commandant seizes this sadness. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) But this has awakened a sleeping beast, Gentlemen. It has put the weapons of this war in the hands of you, the young, and therefore, the powerful. \nHe points to Agu, who raises his head. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) All of you, who were never listened to before, who have seen your loved ones gunned down, you have something that speaks for you now. \nThe men raise their rifles, growling a low pitched battle chant. \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu and the initiates sit on the raised platforms engulfed in smoke. \nTWO-I-C (O.S.) The new regime needs to control the trade in resources for the international community to waste time recognizing them. \nOne of the INITIATORS lays a variety of leaves on the fire below them as the SCRIBES wash the wooden tablets into a large enamel bowl. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nTWO-I-C You see, the colonists have never left Africa. Our very own politicians will steal our resources and give them away for pennies in exchange for private payoffs...but... \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nCOMMANDANT They are licking their wounds. They are feeling our sting. We, along with our other brothers fighting further south under Dada Goodblood, we command and control what the NRC needs. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C The Grass People in the South East control the lumber and gold, the Clay and Charcoal people in the South West, diamonds and rare metals, and the Coastal people, petroleum and fisheries. This is the reason the NRC are trying so hard to be calling themselves a \"reformation council.\" \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT Reformation of what? Money. Old men and money. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C They have spit on the constitution. They have spit on your rights. They have tried to spit on your future. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT War has spoiled their minds, Gentlemen. So they could have \"their turn to eat. \n", "test1_true": "Agu and the initiates are laid down in the open shallow graves. \nThe INITIATORS take the gray water from the enamel bowl and place the liquid into small bottles. \nEXT.

PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - NIGHT \nAgu lays in the grave in a haze of smoke and fire. \nTWO-I-C (O.S.) That is why we must not forget that we are the protectors of the people! \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C The richness of our nation is for the young. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT When there is an infection in your foot. A deadly deathly sickness in your limb that's going to kill you slow slow, what do you do? \nThe men do not know. One in the back yells out \"you go to the doctor!\" Generating a chuckle amongst other men. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) So maybe they should be calling us the doctor army and not the hunter army? We have to be cutting off that leg to save the body. That is how you prevent the NRC/PLF infection from spreading. \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nGOAT and CHICKEN sacrifices are made and stones are buried by the INITIATORS. \nThe Chief Priest pulls Agu out of the grave. \nCHIEF PRIEST (IN MENDE) You must die before you are reborn. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C Tomorrow we mobilize for major action, uniting all of our brother warriors under Supreme Commander Dada Goodblood, and with God's blessing, end this plague, end this war, end our oppression! \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu is forced to run a gauntlet through a line of NDF MEN with sticks, branches, and clubs. He is hit hard and without mercy, landing on the other end with his arms battered. \nONE of the initiates falls from a blow to the head and Agu watches in horror as he is quickly dispatched. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nThe men, aroused and growing in fury, grow louder as his speech culminates. \nCOMMANDANT Young men! Gentlemen! We will not wait to inherit it, we will not wait for them to just give it to us, we will take it, we will seize it from their rotting and decaying old hands. \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu looks at the charred remains of the MAN who they dispatched on the smoking platform. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) Victory! \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu and the NDF Soldiers yell even louder, some FIRING into the air in celebration. \nAGU AND TROOPS Victory! \nAgu raises his fist in the air, swept by the energy and fire of Commandant's speech. \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nThe CHIEF PRIEST gathers the charred pieces into a bowl and creates a paste from it. He performs a last ceremony with the cleansed initiates, slicing Agu's triceps, calves, back of his neck. He rubs the charcoal paste and medicinal herbs into the cuts. Then places amulets (bracelets, necklaces with the small bottles of ink, et al) on those cuts. \nThe initiates are lined up. Commandant steps forward with his BODY GUARDS, they pump their SHOTGUNS and fire into the initiates. They flinch but the bullets do not touch them. \nThe Chief Priest blesses them one last time. In each of their mouths he places a ball of mashed rice (like mochi). \nAgu, voraciously eating, hears the Chief Priest. \n", "test1_id": 297, "test2_input": "CHIEF PRIEST Eat the enemy if you bring him down. Become braver, his heart becomes your medicine. \nCOMMANDANT The spirits have blessed you and cleansed you. To the enemy, you are invincible. But there are rules you must follow to keep the spirits happy, to remain pure. \nCHIEF PRIEST No sex with women. No touching women. No talking to women. Stay pure. No looting. No touching dead bodies. No... \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DAY \nAgu gathers supplies from the structures of the camp, Commandant stands over him. \nCOMMANDANT Agu, you are a soldier now. The only way is forward. Do not be leaving any nice thing for the NRC or the PLF to be using if they are coming to this place. \nGriot and Preacher poor kerosene as well over other buildings as we PAN and see the entire battalion is lighting up their camp. \nCHICKEN LEGS Advancing in the rainy season? \nGRIOT Everyone will be on zero-zero-one now. \nHope shakes his head and grumbles to himself. \nAGU What is zero-zero-one? \nPREACHER It is meaning you, me, we all be hungry. \nGRIOT It means no breakfast, no lunch, only dinner. If you are wanting to eat when it is not dinner, then you are having to keep your dinner from before to be eating the next day. \nHOPE Or if we raiding or finding farm, then we can be eating what we find. Cow, chicken, baby... woman. \nThe FIRE roars to the sky, as their structures and shelters catch fire, the SOLDIERS start to file out of their camp. \nCOOK hands one baseball sized ball of garri to each soldier, including Agu, who smells it then quickly stows it in his rice bag backpack. \nEXT. JUNGLE PATH - LATER \nNDF Soldiers disinter weapons and ammunitions caches wrapped in plastic, stored from many weeks previous. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) You are knowing this tree? \nAgu sticks with Preacher, following him where ever he goes. \nAGU (O.S.) It is Iroko. These other trees I am not knowing, but I am calling them children of the forest because they are smaller than the rest. \nThe NDF decorate themselves with grass and leaves. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) When this tree is small, it is looking so so like a cassava plant, except that it has thorns. \nEXT. JUNGLE CREEK - DAY \nCommandant and Agu stand under a tall tree, Commandant seems genuinely overwhelmed and inspired by the scale of nature. \nCOMMANDANT It is even having a root like a cassava, but if you eat it, it will kill you with its poison. \nAgu hadn't learned that before. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) That is why you must be knowing how to use your thorns. You kill before you are killed. \nAgu nods, watching the wind sway the tops of the trees. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You will see the enemy is having small boy soldiers, too, who can kill before they can even speak. \nAgu turns back to the Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) I have seen them do things that are even making the Devil fall to his knee to beg for mercy. \nAgu nods, thinking he understands the analogy. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Have you killed a man before? \nAgu shakes his head. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You will. Today. \nAGU Yes, sah. \nAgu salutes. Realization delayed. Commandant nods, pleased. \nAIDE (O.C.) Commandant. \nCommandant goes to his Aide holding out a radio. Behind, his entourage has laid a map on the ground to study. \nCOMMANDANT (TO AGU) You will destroy anything that threatens us. As I would anything that threatens you, understand? \n", "test2_true": "COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (to his radio) Two-I-C, report. \nThen, queasily, he sees Hope and Chicken Legs watching him. \nHOPE Don't worry, killing is easy. \nCHICKEN LEGS Besides, you already eating a man. \nAGU What do you mean? \nCHICKEN LEGS What do you think was that ball of garri, the one you are eating in initiation? \nAgu, disgusted, notices Strika. His rifle dangling in his arms. He watches Agu blankly, Agu looks away. \nFeeling Strika's eyes still on him, Agu looks back, and Strika is right next to him. \nHe holds up a fruit foraged from the jungle. He breaks off a piece, an offering, and shares it with a grateful but nervous Agu. \nChicken Legs pantomimes eating and touching a satiated belly. \nEXT. EDGE OF JUNGLE, NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe NDF Soldiers tear through the jungle towards its lighted edge. They hop scotch positions, some kneeling and covering while others move forward and spread out with speed. \nThe choreography dazzles Agu, turning around to watch, Preacher grabs his collar and reorients him to follow. \nCommandant motioning with his hand, VHF RADIO in the other, down the command chain, C/O's, and Platoon Commanders each silently communicating hand orders. \nAgu runs with his Small Boy Unit past Commandant's position. \nHOPE (V.O.) In an ambush you don't make a sound. You get injured, you don't make a sound. You see a snake, you don't make a sound. You get bitten by a snake, you don't make a sound. You shut up! You take it! \nThe SBU spill out onto the road with limited commotion. Agu looks back to where they just came from, seeing nothing but green and a stretch of road 300 meters. \nEXT. AMBUSH LEFT FLANK - DAY \nAgu watches the boys of his unit sniff a brown crystal powder (brown-brown) while waiting in a ditch of foliage on the other side of the road from the main ambush force. \nStrika chews on a long root, Agu whispers to him... \nAGU They are calling you Strika? \nStrika nods, putting his finger up to his lips to communicate \"silence\". \nAGU (CONT'D) (WHISPERING) Are you liking war? \nYes, with a nod. \nAGU (CONT'D) Are you liking killing? \nIndifferent, with a shake. \nAGU (CONT'D) Is it easying to be doing? \nYes. \nAGU (CONT'D) Are you fearing death? \nNo, with a shake. \nAGU (CONT'D) (WHISPERING LOWER) Are you having parent? \nNo. \nAGU (CONT'D) I am still having mother. Somewhere. \nStrika continues to chew on the root. \nAGU (CONT'D) What is that you are chewing on? \nStrika rubs his belly as if to say it will make it feel better. He shares it with Agu, who puts it in his mouth. \nAGU (CONT'D) Are you liking Commandant? \nYes. \nAGU (CONT'D) Are you stupid? \nStrika looks at Agu like he could punch him. He snatches his root back. \n", "test2_id": 298, "test3_input": "AGU (CONT'D) Why are you not talking, then? \nGriot hands the two boys a plastic container. \nGRIOT (WHISPERING) Morale booster. \nAgu smells it. Nauseating. Chicken Legs stifles a laugh. \nHOPE (WHISPERING) It is good juju, making you stronger and braver. \nAgu sniffs, then as it drips down his throat, tries to spit out the rest. \nAGU (WHISPERING) It is tasting like licking rock. (smacking his tongue) And eating pencil. \nHope listens to his VHF Radio, turns to the rest... \nHOPE Shhh. They are coming. \nAgu notices all of the BOYS are lowering themselves even further into the bushes. \nPreacher posted behind a giant, red-dust-covered leaf, hisses at Agu, covered in ammunition belts, to scoot down with him. \nAgu notices the sudden stillness of everything, the only movement a swarm of mosquitoes descending upon them, he tries to beat them away. Then he feels breathing on his neck and turns slowly to see it is Strika. \nStrika motions, signaling him to focus down the road. The air wafts in translucent tendrils over the pavement. Then he sees it, rounding a bend, the dust cloud of a CONVOY of TRUCKS and LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLES rolling in their direction. \nAGU (V.O.) I am almost laughing and almost dying, even though I am not feeling like laughing. Inside my stomach and heart it is feeling like fire from a pepper. I am only thinking about what is going to be happening. \nThree trucks becomes FOUR TRUCKS, then FIVE. Large Caliber machine guns are mounted on some of them, as well as GOVERNMENT TROOPS who look out into the green margins of the road with distrust. \nThe ground shakes as they roll over Agu's position. The wheels nearly as tall as Agu would be standing next to them. \nEveryone waits in anticipation, biting lips and focused as the last truck passes Agu. \nANGLE FROM POV OF FIRST GOVERNMENT TRUCK \nA SQUAD of SBU-NDF SOLDIERS scurry across the road like a fleeing deer. Only one stays behind, CHICKEN LEGS, stopping, turning, revealing, an RPG. \nThe PLF DRIVER, realizing, slams on the breaks. Grinds the transmission into a lower gear, then neutral, fighting to get it into reverse when. ZWOOOF -- the RPG slams into his cabin. \nBOOM. The first truck's engine compartment shatters in a hail storm of shrapnel, fire and smoke into the cabin. \nHope signals aggressively. The SBU rushes onto the road dragging SPIKE STRIPS, RPGs and GPMGs. They ensure no retreat. \nFor a second, nothing happens. Agu closes his ears, expecting more gun fire, then. \nThe GOVERNMENT TROOPS hold their rifles into the air. \nONE MAN in the convoy yells out... \nARMY CORPORAL Please do not shoot us! \nAgu grips his machete harder. Sweat beads all over his face. He looks around petrified, confused, excited. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) On the floor! \nAgu sees SEVENTY NDF SOLDIERS emerge from the jungle, ANNOUNCING their presence with an echoing BARK. An impressive show of scale of force. \nPREACHER Agu, where is the fucking ammunition? \nAgu remembers he forgot the extra ammunition. He scrambles back down into the ditch as... \nKPWAP! Agu flinches and ducks. Someone in the bush sprays the truck, bullets ricochet off of the metal door of the middle truck, a windshield is shattered. Then all the NDF soldiers open fire. It is a quick and effective slaughter. \nAgu holds his ears. It all happened so quickly he didn't see the full carnage, but when he gets up, the trucks are chewed up and the men inside are dead. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) Disarm and disrobe them! \nRambo repeats the CALL, moves forward with another SBU squad. \nSome of the Government Soldiers are crying, as Rambo's men kick away the weapons and yank off their clothes. \nCommandant, his ENTOURAGE, and CONTROLLER, emerge from the bush with guns aimed and ready. He is proud of the catch. \nUpon seeing him, NDF SQUADS move up the road to secure the front and down the road to secure their tail. \nThe SBU moves to join the CENTER. Agu walks past a few trucks and stripped soldiers with necks strained towards death. \nHope grabs Griot and Preacher, jumps into the back of a truck and looks around, throwing useless items over the side. \nCommandant and his entourage look for a healthy man and are disappointed by all the dead men. Finally, they find one, the CORPORAL, alive. \n", "test3_true": "COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu, come here, enh. Come here right now. Come here. These are the dogs who killed your father. \nAgu looks disdainfully at the man quivering on the ground beneath Commandant, blabbering incomprehensibly, shaking his head at Agu. Agu's nerves fire off. \nOut of the corner of his eye, ONE GOVERNMENT SOLDIER runs for the bush. He is nearly naked, his body glistens with his comrades' blood. \nNo one seems to mind. Then, MUZZLE FLASHES out of the bushes at the end of the road. KWAP, KWAP-KWAP. Flesh explodes from the man's thigh and scatters to the ground. He falls without screaming. \nOur attention returns to the man held in front of Agu. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu, you will kill this man. \nThe Corporal moans dreadfully, pissing himself as he cries. The pool of urine from him and from Commandant is all around his flip-flops, mixing with blood. \nARMY CORPORAL Please, Sah. I am an engineering student from the university in the capital. I am supposed to be fixing bridges, not be a soldier. \nTears and snot run down his face. \nARMY CORPORAL (CONT'D) Please don't be killing me. Just be making me your prisoner. Please, I can be helping you. \nHOPE Sah! \nHope jumps into the SECOND truck with a fist full of maps. Griot follows him holding a box and offering it to Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT Open it. \nCommandant and his entourage step back a little bit, just in case it's booby-trapped. \nGRIOT What is it? \nGriot holds up a surveying scope. He offers it to Commandant who turns it around when his Aide interrupts and hands Commandant his rifle. \nCOMMANDANT No, no, this won't do. \nAIDE A pistol? \nCHIEF SECURITY OFFICER (CSO) That is too easy. \nTWO-I-C Why not the cutlass? \nCSO Does he have the strength? \nThey look at Agu, who looks back, lost. They discuss amongst themselves, then point at his machete. \nCOMMANDANT Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to the ground. \nCommandant unzips his pants and urinates on him. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu. See this thirsty goat. These are the tyrants who murdered your father. (back to the Corporal) Now look at him. \nAgu grips his machete harder. \nPOP. POP-POP The NDF Soldiers shoot NRC survivors. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Remember what they have taken from you. Remember your suffering and turn it into hate for them. \nNDF Soldiers, having finished off the survivors, collect supplies and check the function of the engines of the vehicles. They start to transfer supplies onto the lighter vehicles. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) (in Agu's ear) God and the spirit of your Father is wanting you to kill him. \nCommandant grabs Agu's hand, the one holding the machete and squeezes his own hand around Agu's. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Like this. Just bring this hand up and knock him well well. \nHe takes Agu's hand and raises it high. Agu stares into the petrified man's eyes. He looks at his feet, urine and blood splattered on them. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Use all of your force, imagine the blade sinking deep into him like chopping a coconut. \nAgu's face grimaces, as he gathers all his strength, he slams fiercely into the corporal's head. The blade splits the skin on the man's forehead and gashes his skull. \nThe man screams an unbearable, screeching, grating sound. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Yes! That is how you are dealing with the NRC. Do it again! And again and again until he shuts up. \nThe NDF Soldiers hold the Corporal up, goading Agu on. \nAgu brings the machete up, swings it hard. KWOMP! \nThe man's screams as sound grows dim. \n", "test3_id": 299}

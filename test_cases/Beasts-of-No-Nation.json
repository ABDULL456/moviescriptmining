{"train": "BEASTS OF NO NATION \nWritten by \nCary Joji Fukunaga \nBased on the novel by \nUzodinma Iweala \nMay 8th, 2014 SHOOTING SCRIPT \nFORWARD NOTE: \nThe dialogue in this screenplay is faithful in form to the novel, originally written in a lighter form of Nigerian Pidgin English known as Krio. \nKrio (and its various dialects) is used as a lingua franca throughout West Africa, from The Gambia to Cameroon, and is spoken by millions. \nFRONT CREDITS OVER BLACK: \nThe KRIO-accented VOICE of AGU (10). \nAGU (V.O.) It is starting like this... \nEXT. VILLAGE FOOTBALL PITCH - DAY \nAngle on: the plastic exterior of a screen-less television. \nThrough it we see children running in circles on a football pitch. \nAngle on the boy balancing it on his head, AGU (10), a warm smile and clever eyes. Next to him, DIKE, his littler best friend. \nAGU Which ones having talent? \nDIKE That one...not that one. \nEXT. VILLAGE MARKET - DAY \nAgu passes a line of YOUNG MEN lying on wheel barrows while carrying the TV. Dike and their YOUNG RECRUITS, the kids they were scouting on the football pitch, follow suit. \nEXT. ECOMOD CHECK POINT - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 14) \nAgu and Dike drop the TV down on a stool in front of the VILLAGE CONSTABLE, charming it up. \nVILLAGE CONSTABLE Agu, what am I supposed to be doing with this? \nAGU Watching TV, Massah. \nVILLAGER CONSTABLE It is not having a screen. \nAGU It is imagination TV. \nAgu has the YOUNG RECRUITS perform, framed in the empty space of the demolished television. The Constable is unimpressed. \nVILLAGE CONSTABLE It is garbage. Go, get out of here. \nAgu disappointed but not discouraged, looks at the PEACE OBSERVERS with optimism. \nEXT. ECOMOD TROOP TRANSPORT - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 15) \nAgu stands in front of white helmeted NIGERIAN troops. The 2ND LIEUTENANT humors him. \n2ND LIEUTENANT It doesn't have any channels. \nAgu turns the knob swiftly. \nAGU It is having 12, and one more, that is the imagination channel. \nHe addresses his YOUNG RECRUITS to PERFORM again. The 2nd Lieutenant is amused. \n2ND LIEUTENANT And how much for this treasure? \nAGU 3000. And you are giving us some of your foods. \n2nd Lieutenant motions to his CORPORAL to get something out of the carrier. The corporal comes back with several PLASTIC CONTAINERS OF RICE AND SAUCE. \n2ND LIEUTENANT Take these. \nAgu reviews the food. 2nd Lieutenant pulls out a pack of gum from his side pocket to sweeten the deal. Agu snatches up the takings, giving some cash to Dike and his recruits. \nEXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nAGU (V.O.) Big Brother, he is more concerned with his muscles, and his skin. Sometimes I add to his products. \nINT. AGU AND BIG BROTHERS ROOM - DAY \nBig Brother has captured Agu and is rolling him up in a thick carpet that makes it impossible for him to use his arms to escape. He looks like a tampon with a head as Big Brother props him up against the wall. \nAGU (V.O.) Big Brother is also concerned with sleeping. \nBig Brother is talking about sleeping with a girl in the village as he dances to music from a tape deck. \nAGU (V.O.) I am not liking his music, and I am not like his dancing, and if he is playing it loud loud I do not know how this girl will be sleeping. \nFuming, Agu looks like he is about to cry as he yells at his brother to be let go. \nINT. VILLAGE CHURCH - PREVIOUS SUNDAY \nAgu sits uncomfortably on one of the church benches amongst hundreds of people listening to a PASTOR with his SUPPORT STAFF with MUSICIANS behind them. \nAGU (V.O.) I am going to church every Sunday with my family. \nHe looks up, distracted, at the spinning CEILING FANS. Mother pinches his leg, motioning for him to pay attention. \nBig Brother is making eyes with a TEENAGE GIRL from across the aisle. She returns his affection coyly. \nAgu looks at Father who pretends like he is dozing to entertain Agu. \nAGU (V.O.) Father is saying that Pastor is thinking he can be talking so much because he is having his Reverend Doctorate -- that is making him doctor of \"talking.\" \nOn another pew, Dike sits with a well dressed family. They raise their chins in salutation as everyone stands to sing. \nEXT. VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY \nThe PARISHIONERS spill out of the church clapping and singing in a parade of music and dance. The church brass and percussion band BLASTING A CELEBRATORY TUNE. \nAGU   (V.O.) God is liking    music more than just talking so if    we are singing and dancing, then    He is listening to us well well. \nINT. AGU AND BIG BROTHERS ROOM - FROM BEFORE \nFATHER snatches the Tape Player from the shelf, hitting the machine to make it stop. \nFATHER What is wrong with you? You know you cannot waste batteries on such nonsense! \nAgu and Big Brother can't help laughing as Father slaps the laugh out of Big Brother from the back of his head. \nFATHER (CONT'D) (TO AGU) And you? What are you doing? (to Big Brother) Unroll him. \nBig Brother snaps the carpet, spinning Agu. \nFATHER (CONT'D) Agu. What are these?! \nFather holds up several the plastic containers of food. \nFATHER (CONT'D) Well? \nAGU I... \nFATHER I?   I. I. I. what? \nAGU I got them from the Nigerians. \nFATHER We do not need handouts. We are not beggars on the street. We are not refugees. I work for this family and I provide for this family. \nAGU But I earned- \nFATHER You will return them. \nAGU Yes, Father. \nFather looks at Agu a beat longer to ensure Agu understands, then he tenders a forced smile to release the tension. \nFATHER Good dancing. (TO AGU) Go on, help Mother. \nEXT. KITCHEN HUT - DAY \nAgu's Sister sweeps the grounds between the kitchen hut and the main house with a small wad of reeds fashioned into a broom. Agu grates a long reedy root into a bowl. \nInside the house, Agu spies FATHER resting on a chair while listening to the RADIO, a BBC-like AFRICAN CORRESPONDENT reporting... \nBBC CORRESPONDENT (O.S.) It would seem things are changing quickly within the interim government. As of this morning, the NRC junta moved to abolish all political parties, further consolidating their control of the government in the wake of the recent military coup... \nAgu's GRANDFATHER sits on a bench. His eyes are open, staring into the courtyard, but he does not appear to be awake, flies buzzing around his milky eyes. \nFather lunges after Agu. FREEZE FRAME again. \nEXT. AGU'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAgu sleeps on the front porch, afraid to go inside. \nAGU (V.O.) I am a good boy. But sometimes I am sleeping outside so I am not having to go inside and be getting a beating. \nThe lights go out on the porch. Agu looks out over the town as all lights go out. \nMother lights candles and lamps and steps out over him to see what is going on in town. \nFather walks over with his radio, shaking it for a better signal. She looks to him for an answer as a RADIO BROADCAST plays the voice of the LIEUTENANT GENERAL addressing the PLF and requesting they lay down their weapons in return for amnesty within 24 hours. \nFATHER Why so fearful? Doesn't the light go out all the time? It will come back. \nMother holds onto Father. Agu watches them from the doorway. She turns towards him, adjusting her display of fear. \nMOTHER Go on Agu, go to bed. \nAGU No beating? \nFather brings Mother in close, Agu waits for an answer. \nINT. AGU AND BIG BROTHER'S ROOM - MORNING \nFATHER Get up! Get up, now!    We are going to church! \nFather shakes Agu awake. Agu, still groggy, hides his face from the light. \nBIG BROTHER But it is not Sunday. \nAgu sees his Father's stress. So does Big Brother. \nEXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nAgu and his family watch as a long convoy of NRC Junta Army trucks enter their town. \nPASTOR (O.S.) It is saying in the Bible that God is only helping those who are helping themselves. \nINT. VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY \nAgu and family are pressed against the wall, everyone drips with sweat. \nAgu, between the towering adults, looks up at the fans but they are not turning. \nPASTOR Isn't God protecting the Israelites when they are having to leave their own home? \nBig Brother sees Agu struggling below and picks him up and puts him on his shoulders so he can see. Agu whispers to his brother... \nAGU Where is Dike? \nAgu scans the room for Dike and his family, but cannot see them. The Pastor speaks from a podium while an ECOMOD CAPTAIN, LOCAL IMAM, PARAMOUNT CHIEF holding his golden talisman, a LINGUIST, ASSISTANT PASTOR, VILLAGE ELDERS, ONE FEMALE REPRESENTATIVE sit behind him. \nAgu smiles to himself, the Pastor looks desperate to him. \nPASTOR We cannot allow ourselves to face voluntary self-destruction. May God bless us all! \nAGU (V.O.) Reverend Doctorate. \nAgu looks down at his Father to share his observation, but his father has a look that Agu has never seen before: fear. The entire room is gripped with it as they murmur their concerns and beliefs to their neighbors. \nMAN #4 What about our homes, property we leave behind? Our crops? Who will protect them? \nThe crowd goes silent as the PARAMOUNT CHIEF leans forward. \nPARAMOUNT CHIEF Linguist. \nThe Linguist joins him at his side, leaning over to listen. The crowd leans in, knowing that the Linguist will only filter. \nPARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) I am listening to the Pastor and to the Imam, and the representative for the women, and what they have to say is wise, but not all of it. It is right that we must be helping ourselves. (MORE) \nPARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) The NRC Junta telling us to be running away is not acceptable. Our forefathers have lived on this land for centuries. It is our duty to preserve it for our children. \nThe crowd adjusts and shifts nervously. \nPARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) Now that the NRC has broken its promise and entered the buffer zone, we should be accepting ECOMOD help and be sending women and the small small children to safer areas. But we who call ourselves men must stay. \nSome of the crowd reacts in favor of the Chief while many more MOAN in fear, drowning out the Linguist's call... \nLINGUIST (shouting over the crowd) The Section Chiefs and their deputies should be assembling after this to discuss protection of this village. We all must do our part. \nThe driver laughs off the suggestion. \nDRIVER 70,000. No boy. \nFATHER With the boy- \n-The driver raises his finger to shush him... \nMOTHER We will find another way. \nFATHER (TO MOTHER) No! (TO DRIVER) With the boy. \nDRIVER No bargaining. Or are you wanting your woman to be walking through the bush to the capital? \nMother looks prideful. \nMOTHER I would rather be walking then leaving my child. (MORE) \nMOTHER (CONT'D) (TO FATHER) I am not leaving him. \nFATHER (TO DRIVER) Please. How much to fit the boy? \nDRIVER No boy. \nTWO FAMILIES, seeing an opportunity, start OFFERING MONEY to the driver to take the Mother's space. Without recourse, Father starts pushing her towards the car. \nMOTHER No. No we cannot! \nFather is picking up Little Sister to place her inside. \nMOTHER (CONT'D) No, I cannot! \nFATHER (whispering, consoling) Do not scare them. You are strong. You will be okay. Take care of them and I will take care of our boys. Now get in, there is no choice. \nFather pays the Driver as Mother kneels down to Agu, unable to speak, on the verge of breaking down... \nMOTHER Remember to be praying praying to God all the time and not to be worrying, we will be seeing each other soon. \nShe hugs and kisses him, grabs his hands, before turning away. \nShe slides into the front seat, the gearshift situated between her legs, Sister and Little Brother on her lap. Three more people between her and the passenger door. All are hot, uncomfortable, and scared. \nAGU Mother! \nShe cannot bear to be looking at Agu, Big Brother or Father, instead, she looks a the faces around her, and then forward. \nFather holds Agu by both shoulders in front of him. Agu begins to cry. He cannot see Mother. He tries to move but Father holds him back. \nFATHER You are with the men now, Agu. Be strong, wave goodbye. \nBig Brother is holding back tears as well, struggling just as hard to be strong. \nThe engine rumbles to a start spewing black smoke onto Agu and what's left of his family. \nAs the car pulls away, Agu cannot help himself, he breaks away and runs after the car, crying after his mother. \nAGU Mama! \nAgu's brother grabs his hand and holds him back. \nBIG BROTHER Let's go home. \nFather looks at them tenderly. The square, filled with the sounds of straining engines and crying families. \nAGU (V.O.) And this is how it is starting. \nEXT./INT. AGU'S HOME - NIGHT \nThe last light of day. \nAgu, Big Brother, his Father and Grandfather sit around a meager plate of rice and sauce. \nThey eat quietly. Agu doesn't like the taste of his father's cooking. \nAGU (V.O.) If I am closing my eye, I am seeing the rainy season and how in my village, they are saying it is always bringing change too fast. You can be finding that the whole world is washing away beneath your feets. \nFather feeds Grandfather, the activity helping keep his thoughts in order. \nOutside, THUNDER rolls, or   something that sounds like it. Father is acutely aware of   it, as if it could be artillery. Agu doesn't seem to notice   as the camera moves away from the family and out towards the   wet countryside. \nAGU (V.O.) You can be walking on road and finding that you are swimming in river. You can be starting day all dry and warm and then be finishing with your clothes like another skin on your body. Nothing is ever for sure and everything is always changing. \nThey break the door open. Light, air, and sounds pour into the room. Everyone SIGHS. \nBULLETS obliterate the three men by the door. GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS appear in the doorway, everyone throws their hands up in surrender. \nEXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - MINUTES LATER \nAgu, Big Brother, Father, Grandfather and several of the men sit on the ground with their hands on their heads. THREE GOVERNMENT ARMY SOLDIERS hold them at gun point, prodding them, shoving their heads, toying with them and tying them up. \nAgu notices that some of the NRC SOLDIERS ARE CHILDREN just a couple years older than himself. \nA GOVERNMENT ARMY SERGEANT interrogates them. \nSERGEANT Which faction are you fighting for? \nFATHER We are not fighters. We are from this town. We were protecting the stores. \nSERGEANT You are Native Defense Forces? \nFATHER No. I am a Section Chief. We were tasked to stop looters. \nSERGEANT (to his Corporal) Bring the woman. (MORE) \nSERGEANT (CONT'D) (TO FATHER) You are calling us looters? \nGOVERNMENT ARMY Soldiers exit buildings and connecting streets carrying looted goods. They dump them into their trucks. \nThe Corporal returns with the OLD WOMAN from his jeep. \nSERGEANT (CONT'D) Do you know these men? \nThe old woman looks at Father, then at Agu and his brother. She shakes her head. \nOLD WOMAN I do not know them. \nThe MEN all YELL in protest. Agu looks angrily at the wretched woman. \nFATHER This woman, everyone knows she is crazy. Just talk to her, Massah, you will see she is not right in the head. \nOLD WOMAN They are not from here, they must be rebels. \nThe men protest. The Sergeant nods gravely. \nSERGEANT We, the armed forces of the National Reformation Council, find you to be spies and sentence you to immediate and summary execution. (to the soldiers around THEM) Waste them. \nFATHER (looking at his boys) Run! \nThe men rise, those who haven't been tied yet put their hands up and back away as the Government Army Soldiers shoot them to the ground, point blank. \nAgu and Big Brother run. \nAgu dodges around a corner as a bullet hits the wall beside him. \nSafely around the corner, he stops and looks over for Big Brother who was just a second ago behind him. Agu looks down, Big Brother is lying face down in a pool of blood. Agu reaches for his Big Brother as his body is pelted by bullets. \nReloading, they see Agu frozen in place. They aim to fire just as Agu regains his senses and runs. \nEXT. BUSH - CONTINUOUS \nAgu slams through the bush, branches scraping past him. His flip-flops slapping the red mud. Flinging it all over him. \nThe sounds of WAR gone. \nEXT. BUSH - DUSK \nAgu wanders on his own. Lost, confused, angry, his emotions overwhelming him. \nHe cries drunkenly, walking deeper into the wilds. \nEXT. FOREST TREE - NIGHT \nAgu tries to sleep on a branch of a tree, he still cries a mournful sob. \nEXT. FOREST - LATER \nAgu again wanders the intermittent bush and woods. \nHe finds one rotten fruit hanging from a tree. Devours it. \nEXT. FOREST CREEK - LATER \nA small babbling creek. Agu drinks water. The sounds of animals in the forest suffocating. \nRAMBO Botu botu botu. \nHe points to the helicopter in the sky, then slides his finger over his neck. \nAgu looks up at it again, his face gaunt with hunger. \nAGU (V.O.) Botu botu botu. \nEXT. JUNGLE HILL - DAY \nAt the front of the line, Commandant raises his hand and everyone stops. \nAn NDF SCOUT steps out from behind a tree. They salute each other. \nRambo taps Agu's shoulder. \nRAMBO Water. \nAgu dumps the ammunition and grabs a plastic jug of water to distribute to the soldiers. \nAt the head of the line Commandant picks up a thick baton- like stick from between the tall ribboned roots of a giant buttress tree. He swings the baton into a ribbon and it BOOMS like a bass drum, the entire trunk turned into a resonator. \nANGLE WIDE above the canopy of the jungle as the tree, which looms over the other trees, reverberates. \nThe sound startles Agu in the midst of pouring a cup of water for a soldier, GRIOT. The naked warrior, TRIPOD, stomps past him. He looks like a giant next to Agu. \nCommandant and everyone wait. BOOM BOOM - a distant retorting response. \nCommandant signals his men to move forward. Agu runs back to pick up the bands of ammunition as the troops now move ahead past Commandant up the valley walls. \nEXT. EDGE OF NDF CAMP, FIRE POST - DAY \nNDF soldiers file past an entrenched bunker that looks out over the valley. An NDF PICKET fires in the air, announcing and celebrating their return. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DAY \nCommandant, Agu and the rest of the company exit the denser woods, revealing an extensive camp housing 400 NDF combatants. It is constructed from a mixture of older thatch huts and lean-tos, haphazardly dispersed in a covered section of the jungle with a parade ground at its center. \nAn open grass field lies just beyond where soldiers play football. \nThe NDF Soldiers greet their COMRADES who also fire into the air in celebration, as well as handing over loot and goods carried by the CIVILIANS to the CHIEF SUPPLY OFFICER. \nThe rest of the soldiers disperse into their places in camp. Some continue conversing with friends as they remove all their heavy equipment, some slouch into corners to relax and rest, others light joints and take other sundry drugs. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - SAME \nCommandant hands Agu over to Two-I-C for deployment. Two-I-C, busy with the CIVILIAN PORTERS, ignores Agu until he is done. \nTWO-I-C (to the Civilians) ...to protect life and property. If you are wanting to stay, then stay, but you must be initiated. \nAll agree to stay. Two-I-C looks down at Agu. \nCOMMANDANT Two-I-C. \nTWO-I-C Yes, suh. \nCOMMANDANT This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him. \nCommandant salutes and walks away with his detail. \nTWO-I-C Yes, sah. (yelling to another) C/O Hope! \nHope runs up to Two-I-C and salutes him. \nHOPE Yes, suh. \nTWO-I-C This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him. \nTwo-I-C points to Agu and walks away. Hope appraises Agu dispassionately. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DUSK \nA COOK, holding a dog and smoking a cigarette, dispenses rice and sauce from the back of a hut to Hope and his NDF Small Boy Unit Soldiers. Others exchange cartons of cigarettes for other extras, peppers and juicier cassava chunks and more rice. \nTEN NDF SBU Soldiers, including the boys Strika, Hope, Griot (17), PREACHER (16), JUSTICE (13) and CHICKEN LEGS (15) collect their ration and sit around a fire to eat. Agu is ignored. He has no bowl. \nAgu, hungry, watches them with hawkish and ravenous eyes. They use their fingers, licking every last drop of food. Preacher sings a song as he finishes his bowl of food and lets it drop. \nAgu dives for it. He runs to where the cook was dispersing food but there is none left. The DOG, the Cook's pet, licks the rest. \nDespondent, he uses his hands to gather what little is left in his own bowl, then drops to the level of the dog and competes for scraps. \nA chanting CHIEF PRIEST leans in close to Agu's face. THREE INITIATORS inscribe messages from the Koran with black ink on wooden tablets. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) The rains are coming, Gentlemen. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nCOMMANDANT You are knowing what that is meaning. Mosquitoes, sickness, muddy squalor. Suffering if we are caught with our \"soldiers\" hanging out. \nThe men laugh at the \"penis\" allusion, but they know the rains mean change. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nTWO-I-C ...the Junta will tell the international community that we NDF are the reason this war continues. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT You, Hope, and you, Rambo, you are not from the same tribe as him. (he points towards Hope) But you are brothers before your enemy. \nHope, Rambo and the troops hum in agreement. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) What drove us to this larger family of strangers? Fear? \nHOPE No, sah. \nCOMMANDANT War? \nRAMBO Yes, Sah! \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu is perplexed by Two-I-C's explanations, the politics are beyond his understandings of the world. \nTWO-I-C The PLF could join the NRC, it would legitimize their cause, make us the sole enemy, and give them freedom to roam formerly Government controlled areas of the nation in policing actions. If this were... \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu is swept away with Commandant, the spectacle, the reactions from the other soldiers he enjoys. \nCOMMANDANT We have defended ourselves against criminal rapings and killings of our own people, first by the PLF, and now by the NRC government. \nThe men grow dark with this thought. Commandant seizes this sadness. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) But this has awakened a sleeping beast, Gentlemen. It has put the weapons of this war in the hands of you, the young, and therefore, the powerful. \nHe points to Agu, who raises his head. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) All of you, who were never listened to before, who have seen your loved ones gunned down, you have something that speaks for you now. \nThe men raise their rifles, growling a low pitched battle chant. \nEXT. PRIESTS JUNGLE CAMP (INTERCUT) - DAY \nAgu and the initiates sit on the raised platforms engulfed in smoke. \nTWO-I-C (O.S.) The new regime needs to control the trade in resources for the international community to waste time recognizing them. \nOne of the INITIATORS lays a variety of leaves on the fire below them as the SCRIBES wash the wooden tablets into a large enamel bowl. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) - DAY \nTWO-I-C You see, the colonists have never left Africa. Our very own politicians will steal our resources and give them away for pennies in exchange for private payoffs...but... \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) - DAY \nCOMMANDANT They are licking their wounds. They are feeling our sting. We, along with our other brothers fighting further south under Dada Goodblood, we command and control what the NRC needs. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C The Grass People in the South East control the lumber and gold, the Clay and Charcoal people in the South West, diamonds and rare metals, and the Coastal people, petroleum and fisheries. This is the reason the NRC are trying so hard to be calling themselves a \"reformation council.\" \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT Reformation of what? Money. Old men and money. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP ROCK (INTERCUT) \nTWO-I-C They have spit on the constitution. They have spit on your rights. They have tried to spit on your future. \nEXT. NDF PARADE GROUNDS (INTERCUT) \nCOMMANDANT War has spoiled their minds, Gentlemen. So they could have \"their turn to eat. \nCHIEF PRIEST Eat the enemy if you bring him down. Become braver, his heart becomes your medicine. \nCOMMANDANT The spirits have blessed you and cleansed you. To the enemy, you are invincible. But there are rules you must follow to keep the spirits happy, to remain pure. \nCHIEF PRIEST No sex with women. No touching women. No talking to women. Stay pure. No looting. No touching dead bodies. No... \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DAY \nAgu gathers supplies from the structures of the camp, Commandant stands over him. \nCOMMANDANT Agu, you are a soldier now. The only way is forward. Do not be leaving any nice thing for the NRC or the PLF to be using if they are coming to this place. \nGriot and Preacher poor kerosene as well over other buildings as we PAN and see the entire battalion is lighting up their camp. \nCHICKEN LEGS Advancing in the rainy season? \nGRIOT Everyone will be on zero-zero-one now. \nHope shakes his head and grumbles to himself. \nAGU What is zero-zero-one? \nPREACHER It is meaning you, me, we all be hungry. \nGRIOT It means no breakfast, no lunch, only dinner. If you are wanting to eat when it is not dinner, then you are having to keep your dinner from before to be eating the next day. \nHOPE Or if we raiding or finding farm, then we can be eating what we find. Cow, chicken, baby... woman. \nThe FIRE roars to the sky, as their structures and shelters catch fire, the SOLDIERS start to file out of their camp. \nCOOK hands one baseball sized ball of garri to each soldier, including Agu, who smells it then quickly stows it in his rice bag backpack. \nEXT. JUNGLE PATH - LATER \nNDF Soldiers disinter weapons and ammunitions caches wrapped in plastic, stored from many weeks previous. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) You are knowing this tree? \nAgu sticks with Preacher, following him where ever he goes. \nAGU (O.S.) It is Iroko. These other trees I am not knowing, but I am calling them children of the forest because they are smaller than the rest. \nThe NDF decorate themselves with grass and leaves. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) When this tree is small, it is looking so so like a cassava plant, except that it has thorns. \nEXT. JUNGLE CREEK - DAY \nCommandant and Agu stand under a tall tree, Commandant seems genuinely overwhelmed and inspired by the scale of nature. \nCOMMANDANT It is even having a root like a cassava, but if you eat it, it will kill you with its poison. \nAgu hadn't learned that before. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) That is why you must be knowing how to use your thorns. You kill before you are killed. \nAgu nods, watching the wind sway the tops of the trees. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You will see the enemy is having small boy soldiers, too, who can kill before they can even speak. \nAgu turns back to the Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) I have seen them do things that are even making the Devil fall to his knee to beg for mercy. \nAgu nods, thinking he understands the analogy. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Have you killed a man before? \nAgu shakes his head. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You will. Today. \nAGU Yes, sah. \nAgu salutes. Realization delayed. Commandant nods, pleased. \nAIDE (O.C.) Commandant. \nCommandant goes to his Aide holding out a radio. Behind, his entourage has laid a map on the ground to study. \nCOMMANDANT (TO AGU) You will destroy anything that threatens us. As I would anything that threatens you, understand? \nAGU (CONT'D) Why are you not talking, then? \nGriot hands the two boys a plastic container. \nGRIOT (WHISPERING) Morale booster. \nAgu smells it. Nauseating. Chicken Legs stifles a laugh. \nHOPE (WHISPERING) It is good juju, making you stronger and braver. \nAgu sniffs, then as it drips down his throat, tries to spit out the rest. \nAGU (WHISPERING) It is tasting like licking rock. (smacking his tongue) And eating pencil. \nHope listens to his VHF Radio, turns to the rest... \nHOPE Shhh. They are coming. \nAgu notices all of the BOYS are lowering themselves even further into the bushes. \nPreacher posted behind a giant, red-dust-covered leaf, hisses at Agu, covered in ammunition belts, to scoot down with him. \nAgu notices the sudden stillness of everything, the only movement a swarm of mosquitoes descending upon them, he tries to beat them away. Then he feels breathing on his neck and turns slowly to see it is Strika. \nStrika motions, signaling him to focus down the road. The air wafts in translucent tendrils over the pavement. Then he sees it, rounding a bend, the dust cloud of a CONVOY of TRUCKS and LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLES rolling in their direction. \nAGU (V.O.) I am almost laughing and almost dying, even though I am not feeling like laughing. Inside my stomach and heart it is feeling like fire from a pepper. I am only thinking about what is going to be happening. \nThree trucks becomes FOUR TRUCKS, then FIVE. Large Caliber machine guns are mounted on some of them, as well as GOVERNMENT TROOPS who look out into the green margins of the road with distrust. \nThe ground shakes as they roll over Agu's position. The wheels nearly as tall as Agu would be standing next to them. \nEveryone waits in anticipation, biting lips and focused as the last truck passes Agu. \nANGLE FROM POV OF FIRST GOVERNMENT TRUCK \nA SQUAD of SBU-NDF SOLDIERS scurry across the road like a fleeing deer. Only one stays behind, CHICKEN LEGS, stopping, turning, revealing, an RPG. \nThe PLF DRIVER, realizing, slams on the breaks. Grinds the transmission into a lower gear, then neutral, fighting to get it into reverse when. ZWOOOF -- the RPG slams into his cabin. \nBOOM. The first truck's engine compartment shatters in a hail storm of shrapnel, fire and smoke into the cabin. \nHope signals aggressively. The SBU rushes onto the road dragging SPIKE STRIPS, RPGs and GPMGs. They ensure no retreat. \nFor a second, nothing happens. Agu closes his ears, expecting more gun fire, then. \nThe GOVERNMENT TROOPS hold their rifles into the air. \nONE MAN in the convoy yells out... \nARMY CORPORAL Please do not shoot us! \nAgu grips his machete harder. Sweat beads all over his face. He looks around petrified, confused, excited. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) On the floor! \nAgu sees SEVENTY NDF SOLDIERS emerge from the jungle, ANNOUNCING their presence with an echoing BARK. An impressive show of scale of force. \nPREACHER Agu, where is the fucking ammunition? \nAgu remembers he forgot the extra ammunition. He scrambles back down into the ditch as... \nKPWAP! Agu flinches and ducks. Someone in the bush sprays the truck, bullets ricochet off of the metal door of the middle truck, a windshield is shattered. Then all the NDF soldiers open fire. It is a quick and effective slaughter. \nAgu holds his ears. It all happened so quickly he didn't see the full carnage, but when he gets up, the trucks are chewed up and the men inside are dead. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) Disarm and disrobe them! \nRambo repeats the CALL, moves forward with another SBU squad. \nSome of the Government Soldiers are crying, as Rambo's men kick away the weapons and yank off their clothes. \nCommandant, his ENTOURAGE, and CONTROLLER, emerge from the bush with guns aimed and ready. He is proud of the catch. \nUpon seeing him, NDF SQUADS move up the road to secure the front and down the road to secure their tail. \nThe SBU moves to join the CENTER. Agu walks past a few trucks and stripped soldiers with necks strained towards death. \nHope grabs Griot and Preacher, jumps into the back of a truck and looks around, throwing useless items over the side. \nCommandant and his entourage look for a healthy man and are disappointed by all the dead men. Finally, they find one, the CORPORAL, alive. \nCOMMANDANT Explain. \nTWO-I-C It's very difficult, suh. Our     men are fighting bravely but- \nCOMMANDANT But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task. \nCommandant motions for the MORTAR MAN to set up a mortar to help the HILL ADVANCE. \nEXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - SAME \nTwo-I-C and his forward operation team are hunkered down behind a building facing a PLF stronghold -- TWO MACHINE GUN nests with sand bags in front of the heavily defended bridge which looks like a former check point. \nTWO-I-C We need support, suh. The men's spirts are low, suh. \nBehind Two-I-C there is general chaos. The men are not advancing and many are retreating. JUSTICE is yelling at the men around him to help him carry an injured RAMBO to safety, but no one will help him. \nHe is driven to tears in the chaos, spinning in circles trying to get a grown-up to help him as Rambo bleeds out on the street. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) Sustain. \nEXT. BURNT VILLAGE, CENTRAL INTERSECTION - DAY \nCommandant lets his radio hang around his neck, watching the HILL BATTLE progress again. \nCOMMANDANT Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this. \nAgu and Strika obey. Commandant holds the scope up for them. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) This is a very special device, you can be seeing the enemy with it, even when they are hiding. \nAgu, through the scope, sees the FORWARD STRIKE NDF SOLDIERS unload and disperse. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You see? \nHe motions for the mortar to fire. Agu looks through it while the first blasts force the PLF to scurry. Strika, impatient for his try, paces. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) It's magic. (to the men) I need volunteers! Who has heart? Who wants to fight with me? Who isn't afraid of bullets!? \nThe men ROAR BACK in affirmation. Commandant moves amongst the men, placing his hand on their chest, feeling their hearts. \nWhen it's Strika's turn to look, Commandant interrupts his try by asking him if he has heart for battle. Conflicted between wanting to try out the scope and the call for battle, he affirms he is ready to fight while the \"toy\" is put away by the Aide. \nCommandant selects men and boys to go with him, those who aren't selected are pushed aside and kneel down in shame and disappointment. Amongst the selected are Agu, Strika, Hope, Chicken Legs, and Griot. \nAn AA technical rushes back around the market towards the intersection under a hailstorm of bullets and clouds of smoke, PREACHER is in the back firing back with RANDY and a couple other SBU's. \nThe Technical screeches into position at the top of the intersection leading to the bridge. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Chicken Legs, go! \nChicken Legs runs to the intersection with Griot in support, to fire an RPG down on the bridge. \nThe SELECTED TEAM, about 20 MEN and SBUs, advance towards the bridge. \nEXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nCommandant CHANTS a war chant, \"no retreat, no surrender, men dropping, men moving\". The men respond to the CHANT, all of them, a battle cry that rouses. They keep huffing into the chant as Commandant addresses them... \nCOMMANDANT These bullets? \nThe WHISTLE of bullets increases and, where most rational men would duck, has no affect on Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) They are nothing. No one can touch us! \nThe Commandant pulls a chanting Agu up near him and uses him as an example. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Are you afraid? \nAgu shakes his head, even if inside he is afraid. \nCommandant, along with Tripod and the Controller. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Moove it!    Gentlemen! Moooooove it! \nThe NDF SOLDIERS YELL again. A NERVE TINGLING BATTLE CRY. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) No retreat! No surrender! Men dropping! Men moving! \nThe bullets whistle by angrily. Then, a tidal wave of wind and fire is laid down on them, tearing up a building's wall and wooden kiosks around them. The men do not flinch, they believe they cannot be hit, although some MEN do go down, the majority continues the advance. \nAgu is astonished, but because everyone else keeps moving, so does he. To his left, Commandant smiles at him, loving the adrenaline of battle. TRIPOD prancing in front of them. \nCommandant lays out a line of brown-brown. He snorts it and beckons Agu to do the same. Agu, having seen others do this, knows how, but has never experienced it. He sniffs eagerly. The Brown-brown going straight to his head. \nCOMMANDANT You are wanting to know how to be leading? \nAGU No, sah. I am happying to be following you, sah. \nHis nose tingles. \nCOMMANDANT That is good, Agu, because there is no learning to be leading. Some men is born to leading, other is born to following, and other is only waiting to be dying. \nAGU I am following you, sah. \nCOMMANDANT No, Agu. You are different. You are reminding me of me when I was a little boy, and this means you are borning to be leader. But even the best leader Agu, must first be learning to be good follower. Sometimes I even have to be following the Supreme Commander, if when I am not agreeing. \nAGU Yes, sah. I am a good follower, sah. \nCommandant points at the map. Lines of two highways intersect near the bottom center. He points at it. \nCOMMANDANT You are seeing this place. Supreme Commander is saying this is important. So it is important for me then. \nAgu nods. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) If we get this place, then we can go to Taro. Is that where your mother is? \nAGU I am thinking she is in the Capital, sah. \nCOMMANDANT After Goodblood greets us, we all will be going to the Capital, that is a certainty. \nAgu nods. It is hard for him to think of her without feeling emotions, and he doesn't want to show Commandant these childish emotions. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am wanting to be helping you more than the others, Agu. \nPreacher SINGS somewhere in the encampment. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) But do not be telling anyone I am helping you like this, this will be our secret. Can you be keeping this secret, Agu? \nAGU (PLEASED) Yes, sah. \nAnd with Commandant's attention, he is able to forget, for this instance, his mother again. \nCOMMANDANT Then be saying it. \nAGU I can be keeping this secret, sah. \nCOMMANDANT In this family where I am being father, we cannot have the other children getting jealous, Agu! \nHe rubs Agu's head, roughly. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Kneel down in front of me. You do me this thing. \nAgu, respectfully, kneels down in front of Commandant as he blows out the lantern light. It is near darkness except for the campfires outside. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am not punishing you, Agu. I am helping you, to care for you. \nHe touches Agu on his shoulder, then his hands drift down Agu's arm to his hand. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) This is what commanding officer is supposed to be doing to his best boy soldier. Play with him, cherish him, protect him, enh? \nHe brings Agu's hand down towards his own genitals. Agu is too afraid to move. Commandant moves Agu's head towards his crotch. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Touch my soldier, Agu, with your mouth. This is a command. You took an oath to obey, and now obey. \nAgu's moves to do as he is told. We TILT AWAY AND UP to Commandant, leaning back and mentally departing. \nEXT. EDGE OF BURNT VILLAGE - NIGHT \nAgu's face appears out of the darkness, illuminated by the lantern lights. His face shows excruciating pain. Everyone is already asleep, so he tries to walk quietly, but it is too painful. He whimpers. \nStrika has been waiting for him. Agu collapses into Strika, crying. Strika holds him. They lay amongst all the other NDF Soldiers, who are already sleeping. \nAGU (V.O.) Strika. He is my only friend, Mother. His eye are too red, his teeth are too brown, his head is too too big, but he is my friend even if he is looking too ugly. \nStrika throws his arm around Agu, protecting him. \nEXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY JUNCTION - DAY \nThe convoy has stopped in the middle of the country side. Everybody is prepping themselves for battle. \nThe NDF Soldiers smoke their joints laced with powder, others sniff brown-brown, while loading up ammunition and prepping for combat. \nCOMMANDANT (O.S.) No one in the land we are going is your friend. They are the farmers who feed your enemy. \nEXT. SALT FLATS - DAY \nAgu kneels down looking for ammunition, drugs, he finds a foil filled with cocaine. \nA shallow river where Government Soldiers are SHOT DOWN in retreat behind Agu. The husk of a helicopter half submerged on the river's edge. \nAgu looks up at the sun... \nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nThe sun becomes the dirty glass light shade of a ceiling light. TWO LIZARDS face off inside of it. Agu's head tilts up, powder around his nose, he looks around, unsure how he got there. \nStrika beckons him to follow into \nEXT. JAH KINGDOM-LIKE DEN - NIGHT \nLit only by candle light, Agu's boy unit and other soldiers do more drugs, a dead PLF Soldier is propped up between Hope and Griot, they place a joint in its mouth. \nAgu walks through another room where money and loot is being counted, the MEN look at the drugged out Agu, only briefly. \nAgu notices THREE BOYS crying. \nAGU What is wrong with them? \nEXT. FORTIFIED HOUSE STREET - DAY \nAgu sits over the corpse of an NRC Soldier. He looks around, as if surprised that it is daylight. \nHope is speaking to him, but when words come out of Hope's mouth, they sound like a garbled language. \nAgu looks up at him blankly as he takes a hit from the joint. \nNow he is surrounded by SEVERAL of his BOY UNIT soldiers who stare and laugh at Agu sitting on the dead soldier. \nHe looks at the group of YOUNG BOY SOLDIERS crying. \nAGU What is wrong with them? Why are they crying? \nPREACHER Commandant won't let them go with him into battle. \nAGU Where is this battle? \nHe looks at Strika who shrugs his shoulders. Agu calls the crying BOYS over to him and leads them down the street.. \nEXT. FORTIFIED HOME - DAY \nAgu walks down the street with the CRYING BOYS just as his SBU blows up the gates of a fortified house. \nBOOM. The gates go down in a shower of explosives. Agu and the rest storm in. \nINT. FORTIFIED HOME \nAgu and Strika run upstairs, scavenging, breaking, scattering, tipping... \nThere are pictures on the wall. Family, smiling faces, long mildewed. \nHope is knocking down a door. KPWAM! KPWAM! \nAgu and Strika join in, kicking, kicking, kicking. They break through. \nINT. FORTIFIED HOME - BROKEN ROOM \nAgu looks down and sees the sky as the rest of the Boy Unit enters the house. \nAGU (V.O.) God, there is nothing to be keeping you from watching what we are doing. \nThe VOICES laugh, the world shakes. \nThey flip open an armoire. A quiet settles over the room as Hope and Griot take a moment to look at what they have found. \nA WOMAN, late-twenties, and her 10 year-old DAUGHTER hide with their backs to the men. \nThe woman looks like it could be an emaciated version of Agu's Mother, she even has THE SAME DRESS AS HIS MOTHER. \nAgu looks at them, his eyes, so high, seem to float on his shoulders. \nAGU Mother? \nHope looks at Agu, amused. Agu moves to hug her. \nAGU (CONT'D) I am not recognizing you. \nCOMMANDANT No. \nThe CSO and the rest of Commandant's entourage voice approval. \nPREACHER Pardon me, sah. \nSomehow, Chicken Legs has died, they drag the body to Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT What is happening to this one? \nTWO-I-C A piece of his own RPG is hitting his temple. \nCommandant closes the soldier's eyes with his fingers tenderly. \nAgu and Strika watch the odd moment of sentimentality, but in both of their eyes, there is none. \nPREACHER What do we do with them? \nCOMMANDANT Leave one living. Tell him to run north, to the next village, and to the next village after that, tell him to tell everyone that soon we come. This is just the beginning. \nTwo-I-C digests the orders. Preacher salutes, turns and walks towards the CIVILIANS. \nEXT. LOWER COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK \nThe NDF Convoy snakes through the wilderness in the last glow of skylight. \nINT/EXT. COMMANDANT'S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT \nAgu watches the passing pavement under the warm beams of headlights, grass and shrubs falling off into darkness. \nINT/EXT. COMMANDANT'S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY \nThe convoy crests a hill and descends down a rusting grand boulevard. A burned out caravan of Bush Taxis rusts on the side of the road. \nWe pan as it passes a colonial era sign on the highway \"WELCOME TO TARO, THE TOWN OF ABUNDANT RESOURCES\". \nANGLE through the windshield at the passing town sign. \nAgu looks up at Commandant. Commandant notices him looking at him, he smiles. \nCOMMANDANT Home, Agu. \nEXT. T.A.R. - NDF CHECK POINT - DAY \nThey approach an improvised check point guarded by SOLDIERS who look much like our NDF Soldiers from a distance. Rusted and shot up cars line the road side, as if pitched gun battles had taken place here long before. \nThe convoy stops a 100 hundred meters before it as THREE HEAVILY ARMED MEN approach them from the sides of the road, ready to fire. \nThey wear the same amulets and pieces of equipment as the NDF but their clothes are covered in a CHARCOAL rub and OIL dipped materials: the CHARCOAL FACTION of the NDF. \nCHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Halt!   Enemy or friend?! \nPREACHER Friend! \nCHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Drop your arms to be recognized! \nPREACHER We are NDF. (code exchanged) \nCHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Who is your Commander? \nCOMMANDANT I am. \nCommandant steps out of his vehicle, walking to the front, immediately protected by his entourage. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) What kind of welcome is this, enh, for a hero battalion? \nCHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER I am not having instructions to be receiving you. I will radio HQ. Hold ground. \nThe Charcoal NDF Soldier steps to the side with his VHF RADIO. He speaks inaudibly into it, looking back at the convoy, then receives instructions. \nHe sends another CHARCOAL NDF -- PRINCE, who JUMPS ONTO THE SIDE of Preacher's truck, waiving for the convoy to follow. \nCHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER (CONT'D) I have instructions to take you to HQ immediately. The Supreme Commander, he is awaiting you. \nThey pull through the convoy. About 30 CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIERS watch them go by curiously. \nCommandant, suspicious but willing to let this pass, waves his battalion off to the side of the road. \nINT./EXT. T.A.R. MAIN BOULEVARD - DAY \nWIDE ANGLE OVER TARO. Commandant's truck moves into town. \nINT. SUPREME COMMANDER HQ - ANOTHER WAITING ROOM - LATER \nThey are all sleeping. \nDEPUTY Commandant. \nThey stir. \nDEPUTY (CONT'D) The Supreme Commander felt ill and has gone home for the evening. \nThe Deputy can see this will not satisfy Commandant, who looks like he could squeeze the life out of this functionary. \nDEPUTY (CONT'D) But he invites you to his home first appointment in the morning. \nCOMMANDANT Where are you putting us to be sleeping? \nDEPUTY I hope this room, with the air conditioning, will be sufficient. Thank you, Gentlemen. \nINT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S HQ - HALLWAY - DAY \nThey walk down a pleasant hallway, as if they were on a museum tour, Strika and Agu are dazzled by the cleanliness of it all. \nDEPUTY Commandant, I trust you rested well. I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your Battalion this morning. \nCommandant walks past him. \nTWO-I-C Thank you, Deputy. \nINT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S OFFICE - DAY \nThey spill out into a foyer flanked by a dining room and an office with chairs arranged for long, circuitous conversations. \nCommandant takes a seat, the rest of the entourage hold back uncomfortably, along the edge of the room. \nThe Deputy enters a door on the opposite side of the room where UHF radio chatter links Goodblood to his commanders and fighters across the country. There, an elder statesman like intellectual appears in the doorway, DADA GOODBLOOD, followed by the deputy. \nEVERYONE stands and salutes. Agu strains to finally see the man they have all spoken about. He wears a fine combination of clothes, and looks smart, even in his morning slippers, newspaper in hand, Deputy holds his coffee. He sits on the smaller chair, near to Commandant. \nGOODBLOOD At ease Gentlemen. At ease... \nGoodblood smiles warmly as he sits. \nGOODBLOOD (CONT'D) Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT Supreme Commander, sah. \nGOODBLOOD I must apologize for yesterday, so much busy-ness these days, it's worn me down. \nCommandant doesn't hide his frustration. \nCOMMANDANT I'm sorry you were feeling weak, sah. \nGOODBLOOD I see your family has grown. \nHe looks at the entourage watching them, in particular the boys. \nGOODBLOOD (CONT'D) They will want to eat while we talk. Unless you are hungry, too? \nGoodblood looks at Deputy, who quickly realizes he must usher the men to the adjoining room that offers Commandant and Goodblood more privacy. \nCOMMANDANT I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a plate. \nTwo-I-C starts to move- \nGOODBLOOD Two-I-C, you stay. Deputy? \nThe Deputy nods dutifully. \nIn the dining room a table of European style food is quickly sacked by the men. Strika and Agu stuff croissants into their pockets and sit on the floor, rolling slices of meat and stuffing them in their mouths. \nAgu keeps one eye on the meeting, where the Commandant and Goodblood share weighted stares. Goodblood reading Commandant's emotional weariness, Commandant reading Goodblood's ill intentions. Two-I-C is paralyzed between them. \nCOMMANDANT What is this, Chief? Why are you making me wait? \nGOODBLOOD It is your duty. \nCOMMANDANT Something has changed, what is it? \nHe sniffs out Goodblood. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) We are not taking the Capital? \nApproaching Two-I-C, thinking he is dead. Two-I-C's eyes are open and he's trying to whisper something. Agu cannot hear it. He leans in closer. Two-I-C's breaths a death rattle. \nTWO-I-C You are just a boy. \nAgu looks at his hand, clammy and yellow, fingers gripping his blanket. \nTWO-I-C (CONT'D) Do you know you are just a boy? \nTwo-I-C begins to tremble, panic. Agu reaches for his hand, holds it. \nTWO-I-C (CONT'D) Was this all for nothing? \nHe looks at Two-I-C, unsure why he is feeling sad for this man at this moment. \nAGU (V.O.) It is like God is turning his gaze on Two-I-C. \nTwo-I-C exhales, the trembling ceases. He is dead. Agu, drawn by the fading light, walks to the balcony overlooking the town. \nCOMMANDANT Agu? Is that you. \nAgu can barely perceive Commandant sitting in the railing, his skin reflecting the faint embers of a joint cupped in his hands. Agu does not respond. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Agu. Come. Sit down with me. \nAgu leans into the railing. Commandant rubs the back of his neck. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) It is dangerous times now, Agu. Can't be trusting nobody. That is why it is always good to be sleeping with one eye open. And that is why I have you and Strika. \nTripod enters with RADIO OPERATOR. \nTRIPOD Goodblood is asking for you. \nCommandant waves him away. Tripod, aware things have changed, waits an explanation. \nCOMMANDANT Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you. \nAgu cannot tell if he heard him say it or if he dreamed he said it. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Sometimes I am. \nAGU Two-I-C is dead. \nEXT. UNFINISHED BUILDING - NIGHT \nPreacher SINGS over Two-I-C's body. They strip him of his \"Two-I-C\" jacket, his belt, boots, and anything else of use. He is left with only his dirty socks and underwear. \nAGU (V.O.) It is taking Two-I-C all day to be dying, and then he is dying when the moon is full and the night is shining like silver. \nCOMMANDANT You are my new Two-I-C. \nCommandant places the jacket on Tripod, who proudly puts it on over his bare chest. \nAGU (V.O.) The the only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying. \nCOMMANDANT This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong! \nMEN Strong and proud! \nCOMMANDANT That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out. \nThe NDF Soldiers take stock in what they have, burn their vehicles and move out. \nEXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT \nFog swirls along the canopy of the jungle. Commandant's tent has been reduced to a small lean to, separate from where everyone else sleeps under the trees. \nAGU (V.O.) Mother. If this war is ever ending I am thinking, I cannot be going back to doing child thing. \nEveryone sleeps. Suddenly they are attacked from unseen forces. Bullets pound the ground around them, burying men in dirt and tearing others up with shrapnel. \nAGU (V.O.) We are just wild animals now with no place to be going. \nAgu and Strika hold each other while bullet shells pour on them. The battle is over as quickly as it began. \nCommandant is frazzled. He picks up his hat, dusting it off, while yelling for the men to fall back. \nPreacher moves up and down the line, checking the men. \nPREACHER Tripod, Hope! \nAgu looks down the line. They are both bleeding. Hope is dead. Tripod still breathes, but his body is leaking blood from many wounds. He screams while staring wildly at everyone looking down at him, breathing. \nEXT. MUDDY RED TRENCH - MORNING \nAgu stands alone in knee deep water peeing into the same. He notices a floating corpse next to where he is peeing, its BOOTS looking in decent condition. \nHe stops peeing and pries the boots off, falling back into the water. \nWhen he gets up he notices the GIRL from the whorehouse, now fully pregnant trying to climb out of the trench to escape. \nHis first instinct is to grab his rifle and aim. She sees this, they lock eyes, but she tests him, stepping higher. He lowers his aim. \nShe thanks him with her eyes, but doesn't make it more than 15 feet before SWOOFFF, a bullet from a SNIPER far off on the other side of a BURNED FIELD drops her - the MEN the trench Agu is hiding in was built to hide from. \nAgu, only briefly saddened by the quick end to the girl, goes back to prying off the dead man's boot. \nEXT. MUDDY RED TRENCH - DAY \nThe rain mists on Agu, newish boots hanging on his shoulders from their laces. The MOTHER'S SONG sings again from some place off in the mist. \nAGU (V.O.) Mother, your song is making my body to move and I am not having to think anymore, not about Strika, not about this war, not about any of the thing that are jumping into my head. \nHe sits in a fox hole overlooking the burnt field. PREACHER tries to take a pop shot at someone on the other side of the field. \nPREACHER Ammo. Find me some fucking bullets to be shooting, Agu. \nAGU He is dead. \nPREACHER Who is dead? \nAGU Him. \nAgu points to the man he pried the boots from. Bored, he goes to find ammo, digging through abandoned rifles and dead bodies. \nAGU (V.O.) I want to be going to that person who is singing and taking all of the sound so I can be keeping it in my pocket, to be having it for myself. \nThe trench is filled with more water. Agu walks through it towards the inner part of the NDF defenses, the water up to his belly so he rests his rifle on his head. \nAGU (V.O.) I am wanting to lie down on the warm ground with my eye closed and the smell of mud in my nose, just like Strika. \nAgu looks at his reflection in the water staring back at him. He moves, it moves. He walks, it follows. Around him, the men have created smaller mini-indentations to protect themselves from the rain of shrapnel. \nAGU (V.O.) I am wanting to feel how the ground is wet all around my body so that if I am sweating, I am feeling like it is the ground sweating through me. \nNDF Soldiers are like ghosts in the heavy mist. He cannot see more than a couple feet in front of him at a time. \nAGU (V.O.) And I am wanting to stay in this same place forever, never moving for anything, just waiting waiting until dust is piling on me and grasses is covering me and insect is making their home in the space between my teeths. \nHe rounds an intersection in the trench with a wooden defense protecting it from exposure, leading deeper into the woods. \nAGU (V.O.) One onina tree will be growing from my body, so wide that its trunk is separating night and day and so tall that its top leaf is tickling the moon until the man living there is smiling. \nEXT. COMMMANDANT'S GOLD MINE - DAY \nAgu enters the gold mining area of their encampment. He sits to put on his new boots while looking at the lackluster industry. \nCommandant sits on a throne of earth, a purple rappa covering him from the rain like a tribal king. He stares at the sky, a joint hanging gingerly in his dirty fingers, ash floating on the water all around him. \nAGU Commandant, suh. We are out of bullets. \nCOMMANDANT Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our friend. \nAgu nods, dutifully. Commandant relights the joint. \nHe motions for Agu to come over to him. Agu does, slowly, trudging through the shallower water. Commandant puts his arm on him, gently caressing his back. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) It was not supposed to be the way it has come to be, Agu. \nAGU They are dead. \nCOMMANDANT Who are dead? \nAgu doesn't seem to know how to answer the question. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) EVERYONE- \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Everyone betrays you, eventually. But, I will always look out for you, Agu. I will look out for you because you are my son. \nOut of the mist, Agu hears voices, restless voices. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) And a son always protects his father. \nAgu pulls away from Commandant and trudges towards the entrance to let Preacher through. \nAs they pass a line of former ECOMOD TROOPS now re-organized as UN forces, Agu notices the 2nd Lieutenant from his home village, Alpha Town, the man he sold his imagination TV to, but the man does not recognize Agu. \nAs Agu stares at him, the 2nd Lieutenant is forced to make eye contact with him, but can't make out why this young fighter is staring at him. \nFADE TO WHITE: \nAGU (V.O.) In heaven, it is always morning. \nFADE IN: \nINT. ROOM - DAY \nA ceiling fan spins around in circles. Agu stares at it while laying in a clean bed of white sheets. \nHe is healthy. His skin fresh, his face filled in. His eyes clear. \nOutside, children scream -- with joy. \nAgu sits up. Child-like drawings of war flutter on a desk under the ventilation of the fan. He steps out of bed and stares out the window. \nPermanent wooden blinds split his view horizontally, but he can see through them, at DOZENS of children running into the turquoise waters of the ocean. \nAGU (V.O.) I am not knowing how long I am staying here, but I am staying here for a long time -- some week, some month -- I am not knowing. All I am knowing is how it is feeling here. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nAgu stares at the other children at play. \nHe notices a miniature crab running sideways in the sand, making a tiny trail. \nHe looks back at the kids playing by the ocean. \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nA young WOMAN, AMY (20s) watches Agu. He doesn't join the other children, he stays separate. \nAGU (V.O.) Sometimes I am eating even if I am not hungrying too much because I am fearing that the food is finishing for the next day. \nINT. AGU'S ROOM - DAY \nAgu dresses in new clothes, stares into a mirror at himself. \nAGU (V.O.) I am liking the clothes is clean and dry and it is not having any hole from bullet or blood from the last person who is wearing it. \nEXT. SHELTER COURTYARD - DAY \nThe children scream as FATHER FRIDAY, (50s) enters the compound in a Land Rover. They swarm him. \nINT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY \nFather Friday sits in front of Agu. \nFATHER FRIDAY Turn to God. Confession and Forgiveness and Resurrection, these are the things you need to know to bring the life back to your life... \nHe continues while Agu listens. \nAGU (V.O.) I am not knowing all what he is meaning. The only thing that is making sense to me is memory that I am having of another boy -- Strika - - sleeping next to me, so close because we are the only people protecting each other from all of the thing trying to kill us. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nEXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT \nAgu and Strika holding on to each other. \nINT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY \nAgu sits defensively in front of the Father. \nAGU (V.O.) The only thing I am knowing is the sound of people coughing and screaming, and the smell of going to toilet and dead body. And the feeling of the brown brown and djamba in my blood. \nINT. ROOM - NIGHT (FORMERLY SC. 150) \nThe same dorm room, several weeks earlier. \nAgu sweats in bed, his body aching as the drugs and poisons leave his system. He shakes in bed. \nINT. SHELTER KITCHEN - DAY \nThe kids, including Agu, raid the kitchen threatening the COOKS, they lock them inside the kitchen and take over the school. \nINT. SHELTER COURTYARD - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 159) \n", "test1_input": "The BOY who attacked Agu salutes Commandant. The Commandant addresses him... \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Strika. Is it you who is finding this thing? \nStrika nods his head proudly. Agu avoids looking at Strika as he passes him again. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Enh! Strika? Untie him. (to the other NDF Soldiers) So all of you grown men here, and it is Strika who is finding a prisoner? \nHe kneels down next to Agu as more men emerge from the bush, carrying clothing and loot. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) (addressing Strika but STUDYING AGU) Where are you finding him? \nStrika points to the ground. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Here? Is that right... where is Two- I-C? Two-I-C! \nCommandant looks at FAST KILL and BONE, two of his BODYGUARDS. They yell as the human telephone courses deeper into the bush. \nFAST KILL AND BONE Two-I-C! \nThrough the rustling grass, a THIN MAN emerges with a small SQUAD of MEN. His skin sweaty and yellow like tanned leather. \nTWO-I-C Commandant, sah! \nThe Commandant motions for him to approach. \nCOMMANDANT What are we to be doing with this thing? \nTWO-I-C This thing? It is just a boy. \nCOMMANDANT A boy. \nTwo-I-C is about to explain when Commandant raises his finger to quiet him. Now addressing him in front of the soldiers. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is nothing? A boy is harmless? \nCommandant looks at the NDF Small Boy Unit Soldiers near him. They scream in unison... \nNDF SBU Harmless no, sah! \nCOMMANDANT Does a boy not have eyes to see? \nNDF SBU Two eyes, sah! \nCOMMANDANT A boy has hands to strangle! \nNDF SBU Soldiers laugh. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) And fingers to pull a trigger. BUAH! \nCommandant simulates firing a gun towards the bush. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is not harmless. \nHe looks at the men. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is very dangerous. (TO STRIKA) Strika, are you trying to be eating this boy? \nStrika shakes his head no, smiling devilishly. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am looking at you. You are not seeming like soldier to me. Show me your fingers. \nAgu raises his open hands. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Your hands are like babies hands. What were you doing here? Why are you just laying by the ground like one dead rat? \nTWO-I-C Sah? We need to be move- \nCOMMANDANT I said wait. (TO AGU) You are from Alpha Town? \nAgu nods, shyly. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You should be telling me. \nTwo-I-C swears under his breath while looking nervously at black smoke rising above the trees in the distance. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Just tell me and I will be helping you. \nAGU My father is telling me to run. Run far far so the Army Soldier is not catching me and killing me. And then, and then I am just hiding in the bush and running running... \nCOMMANDANT And where is this your father? \n", "test1_true": "COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Alpha Town? The army is killing your father? \nAgu nods, still looking at the Commandant's pistol. The Commandant leans down towards him. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) We have just come from Alpha Town. It is burned to the ground. \nAgu shakes his head, he feels waves of emotion swelling inside of his chest. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Are you hungry? \nAgu nods yes. He bites his lips, trying to hold back tears. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Thirsty? \nAgu nods yes, again. Commandant motions to Strika, who immediately runs off. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) If you are wanting drink, you will drink, but that is having to wait until you are telling me your name. Are you hearing me? \nAgu nods, tears streaming involuntarily. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Everybody is calling me Commandant. What is everybody always calling you? \nAGU (ALMOST INAUDIBLY) Agu. \nCOMMANDANT Say it like you are proud of it. \nAGU Agu. \nCOMMANDANT Agu, enh? Well, that is what I will be calling you then. \nStrika returns with a bag of water. He gives it to Commandant, he tosses it to Agu. Agu tears the corner of the water bag with his teeth and drains the water from the bag. \nTwo-I-C scoffs. Agu looks back and forth between the two of them, he does not know what to say. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Leave this one with me. I will take this one under my charge, turn him into a warrior. Is that what you want? Do you want to be fighting the Army that is killing your father? \nAgu nods. Two-I-C has had enough... \nTWO-I-C Formation! \nCOMMANDANT You should be saying yes. \nAGU Yes. \nCOMMANDANT Say yes, sah. \nAGU Yes, sah. \nThe Commandant squints in approval, turns away and walks towards the front of his men. He nods to Two-I-C. \nCOMMANDANT Move on! \nThe other NDF Soldiers follow suit. \nC/O RAMBO, a dark and muscular COMPANY COMMANDER with sharp eyes and a red bandana (like the real Rambo), pushes Agu into line and places several heavy bands of ammunition over his shoulders. \nNext in line are a DOZEN CIVILIANS who carry generators, jerry cans, palm oil, water, rice bags and other looted goods for the NDF soldiers. \nAGU (V.O.) Mother, glory be to God in the Highest. I am still living... but I am soldier now. \nEXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY \nCommandant's NDF Soldiers march through the jungle. Agu struggles under the weight of his load but keeps pace. \nEveryone is deathly quiet, the sounds of the jungle, the birds, the insects, buzz over the creaking of trees under the heat. \nEXT. JUNGLE WATERFALL - DAY \nThe NDF, in a long single file line, snake their way past several waterfalls. \nEXT. NDF JUNGLE PATH - DAY \nNature is alive everywhere around them. They seem to move like they are invisible to all the animals in the jungle. \nAgu concentrates on moving his feet through the wet underbrush, wary of the animals that could bite him. A great shadow sweeps over them. \nAgu looks up to see the blades of a helicopter, so large it seems to move in slow motion. He stares at it in hypnotic wonder. \nWhen he looks down, he sees that all the NDF Soldiers have dived for cover. Rambo pulls Agu down into the underbrush. He is calm, but he whispers to Agu... \n", "test2_input": "Agu chops again. The THUD vibrates up his arm, droplets of blood suspend in the air and sparkle. \nAnger, memories of his father and his brother, gunned down in the street fueling anger he didn't know he could muster starts swinging harder. \nStrika walks over with his rifle and helps Agu. Together, they stomp and cut with increasing furry and vigor until the man's face becomes unrecognizable. \nAgu, suddenly feeling sick, rushes to the grass to vomit. \nCommandant pulls him up. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Watch his blood, Agu. That is justice. That is what God wanted. \nAgu looks up at Commandant, then at Strika. Common understanding, mutual blame, between them. \nAgu wipes the blood from his face, the NDF Soldiers celebrate, firing into the air, SING and dance around the dead government soldiers. It is a great victory. \nAGU (V.O.) Mother, I have kill a man. \nA mosquito drowns in blood. No one notices this but Agu. \nAGU (V.O.) It is the bad sin and I am feeling like I am dying inside, like each breath can be my last and my heart will stop its beating. But I am knowing, too, it is the right thing to be doing. \nEXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DUSK \nNDF SOLDIERS SING A RHYTHMIC SONG while organizing the looted clothing and weapons. SEVERAL are already dressed in the new clothes taken from the Government Soldiers. \nAgu and Strika dig through one of the vehicles looking for any contraband. Agu finds CIGARETTES under a seat and shows them to Strika. \nTWO CIVILIAN TRUCKS arrive from down the road loaded with SQUADS of Commandant's NDF forward strike troops. \nMechanics fix the engines of the lighter convoy vehicles. Supplies are finished loading. Platoons and Companies re- organize. \nMachine guns and anti-aircraft guns are mounted on the trucks, turning them into improvised attack trucks: a.k.a., TECHNICALS. \nTwo-I-C hands Commandant one of the Government Soldier's nicer FN-FAL RIFLES. \nCommandant checks the chamber, looks down the barrel from the breech, replaces the loaded clip into it, turns towards Agu and gives it to him. Two-I-C is surprised. \nCOMMANDANT Always keep it with you. \nTWO-I-C If you are losing it, then I will be losing you. \nCommandant winks at him to affirm their pact. Strika approaches with some captured Army accoutrements in hand. \nCOMMANDANT You are my Special Guards now. (TO STRIKA) Both of you. \nStrika stands at attention and salutes affirmation, as does Agu, mimicking Strika. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) (to his CSO) CSO. Take note and act accordingly. \nCSO Suh. \nCOMMANDANT Agu and Strika are now my Special Guards. \nCSO, not knowing what that actually means, just agrees. \nCSO Yes, suh. Special Guards. \nAgu sits down with his rifle, looking at it proudly. \nAGU (V.O.) Always be keeping it. If you are losing it, then they will be losing you. \nStrika tosses Agu a pair of green army pants and an ammunition vest. \nAgu holds them up. Far too large but he tries them on anyway, using a piece of hemp as a belt. He looks up to thank Strika but he is already chasing after Commandant. \nEXT. SAVANNAH - MORNING \nThe NDF Convoy cuts through the rolling countryside, past burnt frames of vehicles. Agu rides with Strika in the back of Commandant's truck. \nEXT. SAVANNAH - MORNING \nNDF SBU Soldiers spread out in the bush, scavenge for food. Agu and Strika play, a rare glimpse of childish fun for them. \nHope and Griot chop through the plants when suddenly a BUSH RAT dashes out of its hiding spot. Excited, they swing their rifles around and OPEN FIRE, killing it and nearly killing each other. \nAgu and the other SBU run to see what they shot when the horn of the CONTROLLER sounds off, like the WHISTLE of a tea kettle, heralding the distant thumping of a HELICOPTER. \nCOMMANDANT Gentlemen! Cover! Cover! \nAgu looks at Strika. \n", "test2_true": "AGU Botu, botu, botu. \nVehicles are quickly covered with natural camouflage and netting. \nANGLE WIDE: the NDF BATTALION kneels, disappearing into the bush. \nAgu, in the taller grass with Strika, Justice, Chicken Legs, Hope, Griot, and Preacher, watches the sky through the blades apprehensively. \nThe sound, its proximity unclear, suddenly nears. It circles, its THUMPING dangerously near. Agu can see the rocket launchers on its miniature wings. \nAgu and Strika lay on the ground, staring into the face of the dead rat. \nIt seems like at any second they could all be destroyed, then just as suddenly, the sound of the helicopter fades and is gone. \nSafe, they breath in relief. \nEXT. SAVANNAH TRAIN DEPOT, CAMP FIRE - NIGHT \nThe Small Boys Unit laugh quietly. Commandant sits with them at the fire. \nCOMMANDANT ...ooh, and they are having so many foods to be eating... \nAgu salivates, he is as hungry as those listening... \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) ...chicken, and cow, and goat, and vegetable, and fruit, any kind of fish you are wanting because the fishermen are always bringing everything from the sea. There is nothing they are not having in this place... \nThe fire twinkles in all the NDF Soldier's eyes. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) The best thing this town, this town of abundant resources, is all the womens. \nThe men smile to themselves. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Ah, woman in this place are just too beautiful. If you just see women here, before you are even knowing it, your soldier is standing at full `tenshun. They are having breasts so soft and so round that their clothes are rejoicing to be holding them. And they are having bottoms with specs so nice that anytime they are sitting down, the ground is also rejoicing. They are knowing well well how to make a man feel good with their kissing and loving, kai! The last time I am in this place, enh, my soldier is hurting too much for me to even be easing myself. \nMore laughter. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) You all will see, because that is where we are going, gentlemen. You will see it all with your own eyes. \nThe men's eyes glaze over deliriously staring into the fire. Then a SOUND causes them all to turn, weapons up in defense. \nTWO-I-C Commandant, sir! \n12 CIVILIAN REFUGEES stare in bewilderment at their encampment, followed by two NDF PICKETS who salute Commandant. \nCOMMANDANT Who is this? \nTWO-I-C Refugees, sir. They say the PLF and the NRC took their village three days ago. They killed most, but let these ones go. \nCommandant stews on the intel. The SBU watch him, waiting for him to make a decision -- will it be battle? \nCOMMANDANT Well, let us be giving their village back, huh? \nEXT. EMPTY LOT, BURNT VILLAGE - DAY \nANGLE WIDE over a burnt out village. Civilian trucks and cars smolder. A BATTLE is raging. From across town we see that the PLF defend a hill that the NDF are advancing on. \nCommandant watches the progress through his SURVEYOR SCOPE. The NDF are held at bay by an RPG attack. They respond with fierce fire. Moving in open against bullets. \nCommandant's main entourage all kneel behind him in the lot. THREE squads in defensive positions beyond them. Agu and the rest of the SBU stand near an unfinished wall. The sound of the occasional passing bullet shocks no one. \nHOPE (whispering to Agu) See what the PLF does to you? \nHope points to a line of DEAD CIVILIANS. Their hands chopped off on a rock next to them. A WOMAN and a CHILD lay on the street, as if they laid down where they stood to take a nap and never got up. The woman's head unnaturally propped up against the wall staring permanently at her twisted feet. \nA BULLET zips past and ricochets off the wall next to Agu. \nAgu looks around. He notices the smashed bullet at his feet. Just as he bends over to pick it up, where his head would have been, a bullet smashes into the wall. No one seems interested. \nCOMMANDANT (into his radio) Two-I-C? \nTWO-I-C (O.S.) Roger. \nCOMMANDANT Report. \nTWO-I-C We are facing heavy fire, suh. \nCOMMANDANT Can you take the bridge? \nTWO-I-C I don't know, suh. \n", "test3_input": "EXT. WHOREHOUSE, DOOR - NIGHT \nCommandant and his men stand outside a sealed door. \nA dwarf like Old Woman SLIDES the window open. \nINT. WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT \nA small room. A fluorescent light casting a blue glow over everything. The men's faces shine with sweat. All of the windows and doorways have heavy black material blocking any light from escaping. \nThe men fill up the room. Agu looks up, he cannot believe what he sees. \nAGU (V.O.) Imagination TV. \nOn the screen is a bootleg Jimmy Cliff film. \nA HEAVY WOMAN, THE MADAME, approaches them, her eyes shine with bright blue contacts, her body is curvaceous and she walks with a limp. \nMADAME Enh, so you come? \nCOMMANDANT Ma. Bring something that will satisfy my soldiers and my soldier! \nThe men laugh nervously, all still reeling. Commandant's ease in conflict with what he just received from Goodblood. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Bring beer! Bring soda! Bring it all! \nThe men laugh forcefully, glancing down the empty hall eagerly. Agu notices a GIRL, young and pretty, sleeping on a bench at the exit to the room. The Madame shouts at her... \nMADAME Get up you, can't you see we are having guest? \nThe young girl gets up slowly and goes to a cooler. She bends over, all of the men lean to get a better view. \nYOUNG GIRL The beer is warm. \nCOMMANDANT How is it warm? \nYOUNG GIRL No ice. \nCOMMANDANT No ice!? \nYOUNG GIRL No light. \nCOMMANDANT Bring the drink. We will be drinking it even if it is warm. \nShe sighs and fills a bucket with warm beer bottles. \nTWO-I-C Commandant. Permission to be dismissed. I want to be going to be checking on my men- \nCommandant turns from smiling to deathly serious. \nCOMMANDANT Negative. You'll be staying here so we can celebrate you. In fact, Mama, why don't you bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Co-mman-dan-tttt. (TO OTHERS) Who's your Commandant? \nTRIPOD You, sir! \nThe Commandant's smile returns. He turns to the Madame. \nCOMMANDANT But you have one special for Two-I- C? \nThe Madame laughs. \nMADAME No problem. No problem. \nThe Commandant becomes serious again, his eyes seem to communicate something coded. The Madame's tone changes. \nMADAME (CONT'D) No problem. \nCOMMANDANT Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya. \nThe men laugh harder. She is annoyed, but not unaccustomed. Agu can tell now she is even younger than he thought she was, barely 14. \nMADAME If it is woman you are wanting, leave this one. I am having plenty womens in the back if you are having plenty moneys to be giving me, for a special girl. \nCOMMANDANT Don't you be worrying about money, ma. Bring me a good girl, you know my specifications. \nAGU Auntie! Auntie, bring us some chips! \nThe Madame turns towards him, sighing through her teeth. \nMADAME This small thing borned yesterday trying to order things around, enh! \nShe goes and grabs a basket of crisps and places it in front of Agu as FOUR WOMEN appear in the doorway. \n", "test3_true": "Agu looks up, angrily. \nCommandant picks up a hesitant Two-I-C and pushes him out first, the rest of the men waste no time disappearing into the hall. \nWithin seconds, the room is empty, leaving Agu behind with the girl. Strika, high and tired, lays on the floor to take a nap. \nINT. WHOREHOUSE, SMALL ROOM - LATER \nAgu sits with his head resting in his arms at the table. An empty beer bottle laying in front of him. He watches the Jimmy Cliff movie. \nSweat beads on his nose as he eats a chip. The young woman collects the bottles on the table. \nHe studies her face, the pulsing of her blood in her neck, the sweat on her brow and nose. He watches her butt move, her breasts shake as she cleans the table off. \nSlowly, he reaches out his hand to touch her, she turns and looks at him as if she would bite his arm off. \nFrustrated and bored, he leaves the room. \nEXT. WHOREHOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT \nAgu walks over to the shuttered windows of the \"sex stalls\" and watches various couples copulating. He reaches into his pants and touches himself when he hears a loud SHOT. \nThe doors to a room around the horseshoe shaped building swing open, as Two-I-C, half dressed and naked bursts out, sliding down against the wall leaving a trail of blood. \nINT. WHOREHOUSE - HALLWAY/SMALL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe men drag Two-I-C down the hallway and back into the room with the TV, laying him out on the table. He bleeds from a hole in his head, his face looks like all the pain in the world is coming through him. \nCommandant enters last, only wearing a sheet. \nCOMMANDANT What is happening? Huh? What happened? \nTWO-I-C (under his breath) You did this. \nCOMMANDANT What happened to my man? Wh- What happened here? \nThey all look at the GIRL Two-I-C had been with, she looks to the Madame for succor. Two-I-C shakes on the table, his body going into shock. \nGIRL I was just playing with his gun, and it just went off. I don't know what happened. I don't know- I'm sorry. \nTWO-I-C (TO COMMANDANT) You did this. You did this. \nCOMMANDANT (TO TWO-I-C) Relax, relax, relax! (TO PROSTITUTE) You did this! You did this! \nThe Commandant points, accusingly at the girl. \nAgu grips his rifle, waiting for Commandant to give the order. GIRL                    COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (crying)                     You thought you were shooting I didn't mean to.               me! GIRL                    COMMANDANT (CONT'D) No, no, no!                     You thought it was me? \nThe girl cries. GIRL                     COMMANDANT (CONT'D) I didn't mean to. I'm so         Are you trying to kill me, sorry.                           and to kill my men? Huh! \nThe girl points her finger at the Madame. \nGIRL She told me... \nMADAME She told you? It was an accident! \nCOMMANDANT Go! \nOn the Commandant's command, Agu and Strika turn on the girl and Madame and shoot them to down. \nCOMMANDANT (CONT'D) Let's go! Let's go! Enh! Pick him up! I want you to take all their women! All of them! \nINT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - NIGHT \nAgu sits next to Two-I-C, who is wrapped in a blanket, shivering, his skin shines with a greenish pallor. \nAgu squeezes a wet cloth over his forehead, dripping brown water. \nAGU (V.O.) His spirit is fighting to be let free from his body. (whispering to Two-I-C) It is hurting because you are thinking about it. If you are stopping to think about it, there is nothing to be feeling. The thinking is the hurting. \nOutside and around the buildings, the rest of the NDF Battalion rests and waits for orders. \nINT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - DAY \nTwo-I-C wheezes. Agu sits at one of the desks separating a bullet from its shell, empties the gun powder onto a piece of gum foil. Agu lights the powder in a POOF. He scrapes the white-grey residue into a line and sniffs it. \nINT. UNFINISHED BUILDING, 2ND FLOOR - DUSK \nThe moon is full and shines into the room. Finally, Two-I-C stops moaning. Agu turns and looks. \n"}

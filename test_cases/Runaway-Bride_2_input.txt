PEGGY Okay, that's fine.  I can do that. 
Ike comes up to Peggy. 
IKE Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater". 
Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy. 
PEGGY (protesting weakly) That's Maggie's seat... 
Ike sits down comfortably. 
IKE ... And this is Maggie's beer. 
He starts drinking it.  ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to steal third. 
IKE (cont'd) That your  husband out there?  Cory Phleming, a local radio announcer. 
PEGGY Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"? 
IKE Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer. 
PEGGY This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know. 
IKE That must have made you proud. 
Peggy takes a small sip off her soda. 
PEGGY He was going with Maggie back then. (quickly) He was never one of her... I mean, they were never going to get... They just dated for a while. 
Cory dives in for third and makes it.  The crowd goes wild. Peggy yells and jumps in. 
PEGGY (cont'd) Good job, honey! 
But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all.  Cory waves.  But not at Peggy.  He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and down by the dugout. 
Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy.  Peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down.  Ike pretends not to have noticed.  The two watch as Maggie and Cory smile at each other. 
IKE It's nice that they're still friends. 
PEGGY (looking at Maggie and Cory) Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men... 
Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard.  Cory scores, greeted by Maggie.  Ike and Peggy watch as Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in celebration of Cory's play.  No looks at Peggy.  Ike keeps an empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt. 
PEGGY (cont'd) I'll be back in a second. 
Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit.  Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it. 
Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him. 
MAGGIE You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? 
IKE You can turn that finger around. 
Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly at Cory.  Now Maggie sees what he's getting at. 
MAGGIE (defensive) You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. 
IKE Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me. 
Ike walks away.  Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused. 
MAGGIE See, I cheer good.  What is he, a cheer critic? 
EXT./INT. STREET/BAR - LATER - DUSK 
Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse.  We've seen something like this before.  Maggie's wild ride away from her last wedding.  Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie drives by the bar and sees this. 
MAGGIE (to herself) This guy never stops. 
INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - NIGHT 
Maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is sleeping with his feet up.  She knocks his feet off the counter. 
MAGGIE Lee, hey, wake up.  Give me the key to the reporter's room.  I want to snoop around. 
LEE (handing her the key) Okay.  Second floor. 
MAGGIE Thanks. 
LEE Don't take anything big. 
Maggie moves up the stairs towards Ike's room. 
INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Maggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and enters.

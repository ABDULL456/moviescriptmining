EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY 
Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms. 
ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops, Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE- HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see they're leaving a 99-cent store. 
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS. Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going. 
They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. 
- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the tops of her thighs. 
- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR. 
- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER. 
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH. 
EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY 
A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai. 
ERIN Fuck. 
Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze. 
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally CLATTER to the ground. 
ERIN Shit. 
When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement. 
ERIN God damn it. 
She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in. 
WIDER ON THE STREET 
The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops. 
EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY 
A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work. 
ROSALIND (O.S.) Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today? 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY 
Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW. 
ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM -- already rumpled. 
ED Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind. 
Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off toward his office. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner. She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed. 
BRENDA Tony Marvin. 
ED Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time? 
BRENDA His dry cleaners.  You want him? 
ED What do you think?  What's this? 
He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card. 
BRENDA Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend. 
ED Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. 
BRENDA He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there. 
Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere, unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin, in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously. Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace. 
ED Whoa. (to Brenda) Remind me. 
BRENDA Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says. (sarcastic) And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think? 
ED You shouldn't judge, Brenda. 
BRENDA Right.  Lap-dancers are people too. 
As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone. 
BRENDA I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call you back. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

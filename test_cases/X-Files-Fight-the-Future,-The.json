{"train": "\"The X Files\", production draft, by Chris Carter \nX-FILES \nFIGHT THE FUTURE \nCHRIS CARTER \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS, AND SOME \"SCENE OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SNOWSCAPE \nA BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19\" television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land. \nA LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C. \nCLOSER ON THE TWO MEN \nContinuing toward us, we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They continue toward us, the wind beating against them, CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS. \nFOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES \nAs they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ICE CAVE \nDark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE, illuminating their faces. And: \nA CREATURE \nDeeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light, seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray, dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows. \nTHE PRIMITIVES \nRemoving crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the constricting cavern, giving chase. \nFollowing them as they moves with animal-like agility through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their torchlight catching: \nTHE CREATURE \nAs it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind. The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor, pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit. Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run. \nINT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN \nThe fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern. \nCLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE \nRising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND. \nThe torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle. Until: \nTHE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN \nSuddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is driven away into the shadows. \nThe Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor. \nThe Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate, stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first time, on its face. \nWhen the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks. But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the Creature's eye. \nLOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE \nThe torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing. \nANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE \nWatching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear. \nWhich are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and silence. But only for a moment. Until: \nSUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT DAY \nAlong with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained GASPING. \nThen SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward in time. \n2ND BOY Hey, Stevie. You okay? \nINT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY \nTHEIR POV OF STEVIE \nThey start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive. \nTIME CUT TO: \nEXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER \nCAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF NEIGHBORS: \nConcerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends. They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen. Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking at: \nA MED-EVAC CHOPPER \nComing off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard scrabble. \nThe side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire Captain watches this, then stares toward -- \nDR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him in route. \nBRONSCHWEIG (over the chopper) Keep those people back. Get them out of here. \nFIRE CAPTAIN (to his men) Move them all back. (dogging Bronschweig) I sent four men down after the boy. They're not responding. \nDr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad. Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him. \nANGLE ON CHOPPER \nAs Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop wash blowing: \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG \nAnd the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper bank away, then turns his look to: \nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD \nWhere A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these vehicles.) \nRESUME BRONSCHWEIG \nAs the Fire Captain moves around to face him off. \nFIRE CAPTAIN What about my men? \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG (brusquely) We're doing all we can. \nAnd he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles, scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what the hell's going on. Watching the first of many REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him. Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK. \nHOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing we are: \nEXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY \nThe chopper is banking over the side of the building, preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK LATER. \nThe chopper touches down and, again, the side door is thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD. \nMichaud moves with the measured pace of authority, approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps up. \nFBI AGENT We've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. No trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one. \nS.A.C. MICHAUD Have you taken the dogs through? \nFBI AGENT Yes, sir. \nS.A.C. MICHAUD Well, take them through again. \nThis is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud does not register this attitude, though. Something else has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what he sees now. \nOn an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like what he sees. And what he sees is: \nEXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nSpecial Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too, is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for something. Dialing the number of: \nSCULLY Mulder -- it's me -- \nMULDER (FILTER) Where are you, Scully? \nSCULLY I'm on the roof. \nMULDER (FILTER) Did you find something? \nSCULLY (impatiently) No. I haven't. \nMULDER (FILTER) What's wrong, Scully? \nSCULLY I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here. \nMULDER (FILTER) You're looking for a bomb. \nINT. SNACK AREA AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY \nMulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room. Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda machine. \nFinding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a button, but... nothing comes out. \nMULDER Oh, come on. \nHe beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the machine. \nNothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing. \nMoving around to the back of the machine, looking for: \nANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE \nMulder's face peering in on the slim space between the machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in. Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his sodas. \nRESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE \nAs Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through. Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it, he's locked in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY \nScully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She answers it. \nSCULLY Scully... \nMULDER (FILTER) Scully, I found the bomb. \nSCULLY (thinks he's joking) Where are you, Mulder? \nMULDER (FILTER) I'm in the vending room. \nScully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a second. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nScully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise to the door Mulder is obviously on the other side of. Tries the door. \nSCULLY Is that you pounding? \nINT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY \nMulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand to pound. \nMULDER Scully, get somebody to open this door. \nSCULLY (FILTER) Nice try, Mulder. \nCAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine open. But we can't yet see what's inside. \nMULDER Scully -- listen to me. It's in the coke machine. You've got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nScully is shaking her head. Tries the door again. \nSCULLY C'mon. Open the door. \nHis response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING. \nSCULLY Mulder? Tell me this is a joke. \nMULDER (FILTER) Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven... \nAs he is doing this, Scully is bending to see: \nTHE KEYHOLE \nIt's been freshly soldered over. \nINT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY \nMulder stands pacing in front of: \nAN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE \nWired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally looking like it would take an expert a good long time to figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the 13:58 that reads on the digital read-out. \nMULDER ...thirteen fifty six... \nSCULLY (FILTER) Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there. \nThe line goes dead. And off Mulder's deepening anxiety, we: \nEXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe last of the building occupants are being hauled off in CITY BUSES which have moved in curbside. As these buses pull away, so do the fire trucks that have positioned themselves out front. And the police squad cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully not realizing this for a few steps, then turning. \nSCULLY What are you doing? (off his non-response) Mulder -- \nOne last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for Mulder and Scully. \nLAST AGENT OUT All clear. \nMulder has stopped and is looking back to the building now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating them. \nMULDER Something's wrong. \nANGLE OVER THEM TO THE WAITING CAR \nAs the Last Agent Out's car zooms away. Leaving only their car and the man driving it: a WINDBREAKERED AGENT. \nWINDBREAKERED AGENT What's he doing? \nThe plaza is desolate now, void of life. \nMULDER Something's not right... \nSCULLY -- Mulder! Get in the car! \nScully is pulling him now. Pulling him toward the car and the obviously impatient Windbreakered Agent. \nSCULLY There's no time! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON BOMB. The seconds ticking off now, as it passes the :30 mark. CAMERA PULLING BACK, ADJUSTING to Michaud. His tool chest is closed up, and he is sitting on it improbably. Still staring at the bomb, then pulling his head down in what appears to be resignation. As the seconds tick away. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nMulder has relented now, against his better instincts. Moving with Scully to the car, faster as they go. The Windbreaker Agent standing in the open door of the driver's side. Getting in behind the wheel... \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nS.A.C. MICHAUD \nSitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds tick down. 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1- -- \nHARD CUT BACK TO: \nEXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nMulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS with them now as the Agent driving pulls away, getting only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we say, Independence Day. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON CAR \nAs all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up, slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city has been destroyed. \nRESUME BUILDING \nAs the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging on every floor. That most of the front of the building has been torn away and we can see right into many floors. \nRESUME ANGLE ON CAR \nWhere it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it for Scully. \nMULDER (with darkest irony) Next time you're buying. \nEXT. AERIAL SHOT OF WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY \nHIGH ABOVE the U.S. capital, the entire beltway. With a LEGEND, to establish. \nLOWER AND TIGHTER NOW \nOn the J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI Headquarters. Descending low on the three-sided monolith and its large interior courtyard. As another LEGEND appears, under: \nWOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) In light of Waco, and Ruby Ridge... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY \nA formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a head table, going over documents. NAME PLACECARDS in front of them. \nPANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of importance, under: \nSkinner gives one last look to Mulder, then re-enters. Leaving Mulder and Scully alone. Scully wearing a pained look. \nMULDER Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me. \nSCULLY All I told them was the truth. \nMULDER They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them. \nSCULLY They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up. \nMULDER (beat) What? What are you talking about? \nSCULLY I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment... \nMULDER Why? \nSCULLY I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993. \nMULDER They were the ones that put us together. \nSCULLY Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that. \nMULDER This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. \nSCULLY They're not doing this, Mulder. (off his look) I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done. \nMULDER You're... quitting? \nSCULLY There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. (off his look) Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too. \nThe door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D. Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him. \nSKINNER Agent Mulder. You're up. \nSCULLY (regretfully) I'm sorry. Good luck. \nMulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt. Before he turns and goes into the room. \nScully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings poorly disguised, too. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange. \nBARMAID I'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement. \nThe person she's talking to us: \nMULDER \nHe sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar. Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers. \nBARMAID Gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting. \nMulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his dark silence. \nBARMAID Poopy day? \nMULDER Yup. \nBARMAID A woman? (Mulder shakes his head no) Work. \nMulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly. \nANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR \nStaring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder, dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit. Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it thought. \nRESUME BARMAID, MULDER \nBARMAID What do you do? \nMULDER What do I do. (off her curious look) I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. \"Spooky,\" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time. \nShe stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured Mulder. \nBARMAID I think that about does it, Spooky. \nMULDER Does what? \nBARMAID Why don't you go home to the old lady \nMULDER Sorry. Don't have one. \nMulder slides off his stool, noticing: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT \nThe street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to the curb. \nMULDER And what's that? \nKURTZWEIL S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. \nMULDER (rhetorical disbelief) He just let it explode. \nKURTZWEIL What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? \nMULDER The Federal Building was too well guarded. \nKURTZWEIL No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing... \nMulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from Kurtzweil. \nKURTZWEIL ...the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check. \nMulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil. \nKURTZWEIL Those people were already dead. \nMULDER Before the bomb went off? \nKURTZWEIL That's what I'm saying. \nMulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment. \nMULDER Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- \nKURTZWEIL Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. \nMULDER You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...? \nKURTZWEIL And one little boy. \nMulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the window. \nMULDER I think you're full of shit. \nKURTZWEIL Do you? \nKurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL, watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play the scene out on him.) \nCUT TO: \nINT. AGENT SCULLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nScully is in bed, lying awake. Staring at the ceiling. When she reacts to a POUNDING AT HER DOOR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole. Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door. \nMULDER (strangely intense) I wake you? \nSCULLY No. \nMULDER Why not? It's three AM. \nScully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic intensity. \nSCULLY Are you drunk, Mulder? \nMULDER I was until about an hour ago. \nSCULLY Is that before or after you got the idea to come here? \nMulder looks at her curiously. \nMULDER What are you implying, Scully? \nSCULLY (frowning) I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting. \nMULDER Is that what you'd like me to do? \nScully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own wavering heart. \nSCULLY Go home, Mulder. It's late. \nMULDER Get dressed, Scully. \nSCULLY Mulder -- what are you doing? \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen. \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG Of what? \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. (beat) Maybe a small roadside memorial. \nHe watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate fireman. \nCLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN \nThere is more movement within his body. Within his chest and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear flesh of the fireman. An eye which BLINKS at us. As we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nMulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall. Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish. \nMulder and Scully moving the long distance to the Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with military scrutiny. \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD ID and floor you're visiting. \nThey both show their FBI IDs. \nMULDER We're going to the morgue. \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel. \nMULDER On whose orders? \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD General McAddie's. \nMulder doesn't miss a beat. \nMULDER General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't know anything about that. \nMULDER Well, call General McAddie. \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't have his number. \nMULDER They can patch you in through the switchboard. \nThe Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He picks up the phone, going through a large directory. \nMULDER Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization. \nMulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard who tentatively picks up the phone again. \nYOUNG NAVAL GUARD (to their backs) Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization. \nMULDER Thank you. \nLEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a con. \nMULDER Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT \nTRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully. Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies. \nSCULLY This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? \nMULDER According to this tag. \nSCULLY And you're looking for? \nSCULLY I can tell you that without even looking at him. (off Mulder's look) Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris. \nScully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse. \nSCULLY This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed. \nUndeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.) \nMULDER Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully? \nScully comes around, reacting to what she sees. \nSCULLY Oh my God. This man's tissue... \nScully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves, stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue. \nMulder starting up the street when he notices: \nMULDER'S POV \nKurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then stepping back. \nRESUME MULDER \nSlows, then speeds up. \nEXT. SPACE BETWEEN TWO APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nMulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding Kurtzweil tucked a few yards in. \nKURTZWEIL See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. \nMULDER Not according to the men in blue. \nKURTZWEIL What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. \nMULDER They want to discredit you -- for what? \nKURTZWEIL For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. \nMULDER You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. \nKURTZWEIL You know my work? \nMULDER (pointedly) Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- \nKURTZWEIL I don't either, but it sure sells books. \nHe says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn and start off. But Kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to prevent this. \nKURTZWEIL I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder? \nMULDER How? \nKURTZWEIL I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. \nMULDER You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why? \nKURTZWEIL According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? \nMULDER It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago. \nKURTZWEIL And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. (beat) What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? \nMULDER Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak? \nKurtzweil is getting intense now. \nKURTZWEIL I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus. \nThey are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls past as the two men tuck in tighter. \nMULDER What was it? \nKURTZWEIL When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. \nMULDER What killed those men? \nKURTZWEIL What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. \nMULDER I'll know soon enough. \nKURTZWEIL (worked up) What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved. \nMULDER A plague? \nKURTZWEIL The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon. \nMULDER Negotiating with whom? \nKURTZWEIL I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. \nMULDER And they tell me I'm paranoid. \nKURTZWEIL Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. \nKurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him. Then: \nMULDER How can I reach you? \nKURTZWEIL You can't. \nMulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his cell phone. Kurtzweil stops, turns. Truly and intensely paranoid. Mulder makes him take the cell phone. \nThey are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking job in the world. \nMULDER I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. \nFIELD AGENT We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington. \nMULDER Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? \nFIELD AGENT Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town. \nMULDER Have you examined them? \nFIELD AGENT No. Just fossils, far as I know. \nMulder is nodding, when both men look off at something that's caught their attention o.s. \nMULDER I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind. \nTHEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY \nStanding in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving toward them now. \nFIELD AGENT Let me just see if I can lay my hands on what you're looking for. \nThe Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by themselves momentarily. \nMULDER You said you weren't coming? \nSCULLY I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. \nMULDER What did you find? \nSCULLY (voice lowering pointedly) Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. (off Mulder's look) The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body. \nMULDER How was it contracted? \nSCULLY That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat. \nMulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by the reappearance of the field agent. \nFIELD AGENT Like I said, these are fossils, and they weren't near the blast center, so they aren't going to tell you much. \nSCULLY May I? \nHe offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look almost instantly. \nMULDER You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found. \nFIELD AGENT Show you right on a map. \nOff Mulder and Scully's traded looks: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - WEST TEXAS - DAY \nThe domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who didn't have access to the tent. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOMED TENT - DAY \nAn electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it, oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support system. The inside of the container is covered with a thin layer of frost. \nWhen the small bulldozer gets the container over near the hole, several technicians lift it down off the shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr. Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the hood off. \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG I need to have those settings checked and re-set. I need a steady minus two Celsius through the transfer of the body, after I administer the vaccine. \nThe men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the hole, through the clear hatch. \nINT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - DAY \nThe refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder. It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of organism growing inside him. \nBronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the plastic drapery to enter. \nANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA \nWhere the body of the fireman is still inside the quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on the face of the fireman. But when he does this, Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away. Reacting to: \nANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY \nThe chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due to the fact that the creature which was inside is now gone. \nCAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius. WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nHolds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to rise and fall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUBURBAN LONDON ESTATE - A BEAUTIFUL STUDY - EVENING \nThe Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line. Through a window he can still see the children playing. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Yes. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN (FILTER) We have a situation. The members are assembling. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Is it an emergency? \nINTERCUT WITH TIGHT CSM AT INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING (NEXT LOC.) \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in London, to determine a course. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Who called this meeting? \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis. \nThis pronouncement has the power of ending any further questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window where he sees some of the HELP is running from the house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the house. \nOff the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT \nA discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KENSINGTON BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet takes the W.M.M.'s coat. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Has Strughold arrived? \nVALET They're in the library. \nHe leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to: \nINT. LARGE STATELY LIBRARY - NIGHT \nA GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with close-cropped hair. \nHe is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD. \nThe others are of various ethnicities, tailored and dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates. Indeed some are. \nTheir business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know. \nBut, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture. \nSTRUGHOLD We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg. \nThe non-response to this has the same effect as a reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow. \nSTRUGHOLD While we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns. \nThe Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the frame paused. \nHIS POV OF TV MONITOR \nWhere Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital. \nRESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN \nWELL-MANICURED MAN More concerns than that? \nSTRUGHOLD We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves. \nGROUP ELDER (speaking up) The virus has mutated. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN On its own? \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Into what? \nSTRUGHOLD A new extraterrestrial biological entity. \nIt takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact. \nWIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY \nThey move toward their car, but the train is coming fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed cars. \nThe train, which is not much longer than this, passes. And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after the train, we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OPPOSITE END OF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT \nThe rails come up a grade where they appear out of a long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear, bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental chugging up the grade. \nAnd now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g. \nSCULLY What do you think it is? \nMULDER I have no idea. \nThey start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the image that we see next might cause us to ask the same question. \nREVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV \nThe Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT GLOWING WHITE DOMES. \nIt is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the impression that the domes are floating. \nIt would give the distinct impression of otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GREAT PLATEAU - NIGHT - HIGH WIDE ANGLE \nSLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g. the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the perimeter edge of: \nREVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH) \nAcres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED TENTS in the b.g. \nMulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing into: \nEXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT \nTRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the field. \nSCULLY This is weird, Mulder. \nMULDER Very weird. \nSCULLY Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert? \nMULDER Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there. \nCONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform rows. \nANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS \nShooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have landed. \nCUT TO: \nOPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN \nThe Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy against the dark sky. \nThere is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no signs. \nMulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one of the domes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT \nMulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with hard blasts of air. \nStepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into the still silence of the space beyond. \nSCULLY Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated. \nMULDER For the purpose of what? \nHIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE \nOur view is down through the crosswires and cables that create the tension support. The effect is a combination of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech. The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed tent houses. \nThough the air is still and there is no movement of any kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different. \nMulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the space. \nEXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT - MULDER AND SCULLY - VARIOUS HANDHELD \nRunning flat out now, knocking away the stalks and leaves that block their way. \nFollowing and leading shots. \nPOVs and Tracking shots. \nAnd chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only cover they've got. As: \nANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS \nThe unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their heads. \nREVERSE ON CHOPPERS \nTraversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers. The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down so as to reveal anything hidden within. \nThe bright spots making sure that nothing might escape detection. \nLOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY \nas she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of: \nSCULLY Mulder?! \nANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER \nAs he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name. \nMULDER Scully?! \nRESUME SCULLY \nReacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to take flight again. As one of the choppers appears overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in a path moving straight toward her. \nCAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft. PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA RIGHT. \nCUT TO: \nTRACKING FAST WITH MULDER \nBeating his way through the corn like Bomba through the jungle. \nMatching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn, sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US. \nCUT TO: \nNEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD \nWhere Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam narrowly missing Mulder. \nNEW ANGLE ON MULDER \nRunning the corner of the field, looking frantically down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign of: \nMULDER Scully?! \nMulder reacting to the sound of her response: \nSCULLY (distant o.s.) Mulder! \nNEW ANGLE ON SCULLY \nShe's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him, and when she gets to him they both break into a run across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint away. \nFOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to a stop in the darkness. Turning to see: \nTHEIR POV \nThe helicopters have disappeared. \nRESUME MULDER AND SCULLY \nReacting to this. \nSCULLY Where'd they go? \nMULDER I don't know. \nThen they both turn again and continue running. As fast as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff where their car is parked. \nEXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT \nWhere Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness, until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and over but it won't kick. \nAs he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff, appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as... \nSitting at a booth at the dark rear of the establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's expression that something's up. \nKURTZWEIL You found something? \nMULDER Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. \nKURTZWEIL What? \nMULDER I'm not sure. A virus -- \nKURTZWEIL -- You saw this experiment? \nMULDER What did it look like? \nMULDER There were bees. And corn crops. \nKurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but this is news to him. \nMULDER What are they? \nKurtzweil slides from his seat, rising. \nKURTZWEIL What do you think? \nMULDER A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. \nKURTZWEIL That would be my guess. \nMULDER Your guess? \nBut Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing him. \nANGLE ON BARMAID \nThe few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in reaction to this sudden flurry of activity. \nINT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nNear the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil. \nMULDER What do you mean, your guess? \nKurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop him. \nMULDER You told me you had answers. \nKURTZWEIL Yeah, well I don't have them all. \nMULDER You've been using me -- \nKURTZWEIL I've been using you?! \nMULDER You didn't know my father -- \nKURTZWEIL I told you -- he and I were old friends -- \nMULDER You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you? \nMulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When, unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat, then goes after him. \nPushing out the back door into the blinding brightness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - DAY \nMulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil. \nMULDER Kurtzweil! \nKurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity. \nKURTZWEIL You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you. \nMULDER Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters. \nKURTZWEIL And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder. \nAnd with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him. \nMULDER'S POV \nUp on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the figure slides away and disappears. \nANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING \nWe get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder coming out of the vending room, not long before the building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now, disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to find: \nSCULLY Something's wrong... (fighting for clarity) I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm... \nMulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing. She is limp in Mulder's arms. \nSCULLY ...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat. \nMULDER I think you're in anaphylactic shock \nSCULLY No -- it's -- \nHer voice is getting thin now, too. \nMULDER Scully -- \nSCULLY I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance. \nAnd Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for: \nCUT TO: \nINT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment, dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing. HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP for: \nMULDER This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an emergency -- I have an agent down -- \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSCULLY - HANDHELD \nPicked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO PARAMEDICS. \n1ST PARAMEDIC Can you hear me? Can you say your name? \nScully is trying, but the words won't come out. \n1ST PARAMEDIC She's got constriction in the throat and larynx -- are you breathing okay? \nHe lays his head down to her mouth. \n1ST PARAMEDIC Passages are open. Let's get her in the van -- \nNEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney down the hall. \n1ST PARAMEDIC Coming through people -- here we go. Coming through -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED HAND HELD \nThe Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder following close by. \nMULDER She said she had a taste in the back of her throat -- there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings -- the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus -- \n2ND PARAMEDIC A virus? \n1ST PARAMEDIC Get on the radio, tell them we have a cytogenic reaction, we need an advise and administer -- \nThey get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior. \nThe 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before he gets an opportunity. \nFOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching Mulder. \nON MULDER \nA moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step. \nRESUME \nAs Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window where se see again the man from the vending room, who was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW. The glass shattering. \nRESUME MULDER \nThrowing himself away backward, but the bullet catches him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the paramedic van accelerates fast away. \nLOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER \nLying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump out, we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT \nA MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff. The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into f.g. \nNEW ANGLE ON TARMAC \nMulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just justified. \nMULDER Why are you telling me this? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked. \nMULDER What happened to Kurtzweil? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future. \nMULDER Where is he? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk. \nMulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded expression. \nMULDER Let me out. Stop the car. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN (motioning) Driver. \nMulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop. Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN The men I work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives. (beat) I might just as easily kill you. \nMulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in the head. \nThe blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on Mulder who has barely had a chance to react. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Trust no one, Mr. Mulder. \nMulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before. \nEXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT \nMulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope. The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense look. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN (with quiet force) You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project. \nMULDER How? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. (beat) Or it may not. \nMULDER What alien environment? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. \nMULDER What about you? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN My life is over. (beat) Go. \nMulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M. points the weapon he's still holding at him. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Go now! \nAnd Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later... THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the ground. \nANGLE ON MULDER \nThe felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE. \nMulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he disappears. \nAs the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The same sound that opened our story. \nThen there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We are: \nEXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA \nAcross the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND appears, to establish. \nCLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR \nCrawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed insect. \nINT. SNOW TRACTOR \nAgent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then reaching for the door latch. \nRESUME WIDE EXTERIOR \nAgent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device held before him. In this forbidding environment he might as well be taking a space walk -- without the security of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the distance between himself and the snow tractor. \nMOVING WITH MULDER \nUp a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him. Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen by: \nMULDER'S POV \nINT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nMULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where soft light is penetrating through several low, arched openings. \nMulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the openings. \nANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY \nWhere Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again, pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in wonder at: \nINT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION) \nImagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony passageway, which is like countless other passageways. Which are actually ventilation ports. \nANGLE OVER MULDER \nPulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before him. Looking down to the center floor where a large central theater gives off a light different from elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down to the central theater far below are several LARGE TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to Mulder's position.) \nANGLE ON MULDER \nReacting to this. Then something captures his attention. \nMULDER'S POV \nThere on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks and architecture surrounding it. \nINT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON MULDER \nlooks beside him where the joint that connects two sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what Mulder does here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS \nWIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS \nMulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods are empty. \nMulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his way around the empty cryopods. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER \nCreeping away from us. Heading toward: \nINT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR \nWhere Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the large stadium structure. Where: \nREVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR \nWhere Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen alive. They are slowly tracking. \nWalking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having sensed: \nNEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD \nPUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and fear he's experiencing, on seeing: \nCAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE \nWhere a woman's body is encased, its naked features hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward. \nMULDER \nhurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the AMPULE. \nHastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship. \nAnd the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the syringe. \nLOW CLOSE ANGLE \non the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the substance. \nEXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS \nWhere Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the blasting all. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS \nWe can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles. \nA small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a rush. Heading off in various directions. \nCAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow. He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip of some emotion conflicting with duty. \nVARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the icy liths that encase the bodies. The water from them seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing mist thick and swirling. \nCLOSE ON PODS \nWhere the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this body moving, as if the heat and the defrosting are bringing the embryos to life. \nINT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE DOWN CORRIDOR \nScully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to do the same on his own. \nThe corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully. Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY -- in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive. \nMULDER We've got to keep moving. \nSCULLY (weakly) Where are we? \nMULDER You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa. \nScully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to her feet again. In real physical pain. \nSCULLY I can't... \nScully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a hoarse cough. \nSCULLY (barely a whisper) I can't go any farther. \nMULDER Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. \nMulder hauling Scully up off the floor AWAY FROM CAMERA now. \nNEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR \nCAMERA MOVING THROUGH SPACE in the empty corridor, moving at a speed equal to Mulder and Scully's as they round the semi-circular ribbed corridor to meet us. Coming out of the mist, Scully back in the fireman's carry. Approaching the place where Mulder slipped down into the corridor. \nMulder stopping and seeing: \nTHE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH \nAs it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it turning slightly, as if coming awake. \nREVERSE ON MULDER \nReacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly starts GASPING FOR BREATH. \nFalling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and she goes down. \nLOW ANGLE ON SCULLY \nHer face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside her. \nMULDER Shit -- \nBut she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse. \nMULDER Scully -- \nMulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her. One - two - three. \nAnd putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to strain. Pumping her chest again -- \nMULDER You're not dying on me now -- godammit godammit godammit -- \nAs he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH. \nLifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again, putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While: \nANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD \nAs it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around it continues to melt and fissure. \nRESUME MULDER \nHis hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to use it when -- \n-- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm. Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The panic melting away. \nSCULLY (weakly, pained whisper) Mulder... \nShe wants to tell him something. He leans down next to her. \nSCULLY (continued weak) Had you big time. \nMulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to WHIP HIS HEAD AROUND. \nMULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR \nThrough the condensed mist he can see CREATURES BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful feet kicking at it, too. \n", "test1_input": "MULDER You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue? \nSCULLY (nodding) The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it. \nMULDER And you've never seen anything like that? \nSCULLY No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests -- \nMulder is listening to all this while looking down at his feet: \nMULDER This looks like new grass to you? \nSCULLY It looks pretty green for this climate. \nMulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new square. \nMULDER Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say. \nSCULLY (looking off) All the equipment is brand new. \nMULDER No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. \nThey both turn, looking at something that's caught their attention on the street where their rental car is parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from earlier. Stevie's \"friends\". \nTooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at Mulder blankly across the distance. \nMULDER Hey! \nThey don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them. \nSCULLY Do you live around here? \n2ND BOY Yeah. \nAs the Agents approach. \nMULDER You see anybody digging here? \nThe kids don't answer quickly. \n2ND BOY Not supposed to talk about it. \nSCULLY You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? \n3RD BOY Nobody. \nMULDER Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment... (off the boys guilty looks) They buy you these bikes? \nThe kids shift uncomfortably. \nSCULLY I think you better tell us. \n2ND BOY We don't even know you. \nSCULLY Well, we're FBI agents. \n2ND BOY You're not FBI agents. \nMULDER How do you know? \n2ND BOY Cause FBI agents wear like suits and goofy ties. And dresses like my mom wears to church. Like on that one show. \nMulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths drop. \nMULDER Maybe you've been watching too much TV. \n3RD BOY They all left twenty minutes ago. \n4TH BOY Going that way. \nThe kids all pointing in the same direction. \nEXT. CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY - LATE DAY \nAs Mulder and Scully's rental car RACES by at high speed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MULDER AND SCULLY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nMulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a map out. The mood is urgent, tense. \nMULDER Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks? \nSCULLY I don't know, Mulder. \nMULDER And where are they going with it? \n", "test1_true": "CUT BACK TO: \nEXT. CENTRAL HIGHWAY - LATE DAY \nMulder slows down to a stop. They've come to a three-way intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that offers them three choices. The car sits idling for several beats. \nRESUME INT. RENTAL CAR \nMulder's got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes. \nMULDER What are my choices? \nSCULLY About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction. \nMULDER Where would they be going? \nSCULLY We've got two choices. One of them is wrong. \nThey are both looking in different directions. The car idling. \nMULDER You think they went left? \nSCULLY I don't know why I think they went right. \nA few moments of silence. Then Mulder steps on the gas and goes straight. Heading out onto the only unpaved road. Accelerating away. \nScully looks at him, wondering. As they bump along at speed. Mulder won't look at her for a few moments. Then, turning to her: \nMULDER Five years together -- how many times have I been wrong. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nHEADLIGHTS appear in the distance on a long, dusty stretch of road. GROWING as they approach, then coming to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g. \nWhere a LINE OF FENCEPOSTS, BARBWIRE blocks their path. \nAs the car brakes, the passenger door opens and Scully exits. A hot Texas wind blows. A dog is BARKING somewhere. Scully walks into the headlight wash, looking at a sign on the fence. \nAfter a moment, the driver's door opens and Mulder exits. \nMULDER Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? \nSCULLY This is great. This is fitting. \nREVERSE ON SCENE \nOn the fence sign, painted in crude letters, are the words: SOME HAVE TRIED, SOME HAVE DIED. TURN BACK -- NO TRESPASSING. \nMULDER What? \nSCULLY I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks. \nMULDER We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence -- \nSCULLY -- of what exactly?! \nMULDER That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself. \nSCULLY They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. \nMULDER Yeah, well they may this one. \nSCULLY What do you mean by haul? (off his reaction) What are you not telling me here? \nMULDER This virus -- it... (afraid to say) \nSCULLY Mulder -- \nMULDER It may be extraterrestrial. \nSCULLY I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. (reaching her limit of impatience) Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder. \nMULDER Been where? \nSCULLY Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end -- \nAs she says this A BELL starts to sound. A flashing light hits Mulder and Scully. They both turn to see: \nHIGH ANGLE OVER A RAILROAD CROSSING SIGN \nSitting all by its lonely self. No swinging arms or gate. Just one little sign between Mulder and Scully and their car. \nCAMERA PANNING to the light of a locomotive speeding toward us. \n", "test1_id": 3093, "test2_input": "MULDER Are we being watched? \nSKINNER I'm not taking any chances. \nMulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head. Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath. \nMULDER I need your clothes, Byers. \nBYERS Me? \nSKINNER What are you doing? \nMULDER I've got to find Scully. \nFROHIKE Do you know where she is? \nMULDER No. But I know someone who might have an answer. Who better. \nMulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds. Off this: \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears. \nFrohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now, followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit. \nANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN \nAs they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's hospital room. \nANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT \nSuspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner standing next to him, talking on the phone. \nThe Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall again. \nRESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN \nAs Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA. Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by Frohike. Dialing on the move. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT \nA FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil. Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him. Jumpy. \nHe takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading into the bar (established), reaching for the knob. Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing there. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil? \nKURTZWEIL Jesus Christ. \nKurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man. Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an ambush. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN You're surprised. Certainly you've been expecting some response to your indiscretion. \nThe W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following Kurtzweil. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent Mulder, you have your good reason. It's a weakness in men our age; the urge to confess. (stopping his walk) I forgive you that. \nKurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery. Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright and civil man. \nKURTZWEIL What are you doing here? What do you want from me? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN You must try to understand, what I'm here to do is only to protect my children. You and I have but short lives left. I can only hope the same isn't true for them. \nOn this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM until HEADLIGHTS hit his face. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nA TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him. Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the W.M.M. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT \nWhere a figure is coming down the street toward us. \nRunning, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the entrance of the bar and yanking open the door. \nINT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT \nModerately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for: \nTHE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER \n", "test2_true": "RESUME MULDER \nMoving through the bar -- real panic in his expression. He heads to the back. \nINT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nMulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it open and finding: \nThe Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned around.) The W.M.M. turns to see: \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Mr. Mulder. \nMULDER What happened to Kurtzweil? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN He's come and gone. \nThe W.M.M. moves to Mulder, who doesn't trust him for a second. Mulder is still breathing hard, sizing up this scene. \nMULDER Where's Scully? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I have answers for you. \nMULDER Is she alive? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Yes. \nMulder stares at the W.M.M. - measuring him. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed. \nMULDER About the conspiracy? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use. \nMULDER I want to know where Scully is. \nThe Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN The location of Agent Scully. And the means to save her life. (off Mulder's look) Please... \nHe gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nWE SEE MULDER in the back seat, reflected in the rear-view mirror. Where we also see the eyes of the DRIVER watching him. Mulder is handed the felt envelope by the W.M.M. \nMULDER What is it? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours. \nMULDER (beat) You're lying. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet. \nMULDER (dubious, to say the least) A virus? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks. \nMULDER This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN No! For God sake you've got it all backwards. \nThis outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. \nMULDER What do you mean, walked? \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine. (beat) Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known? \nThe force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder shaken. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race. \nMULDER That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy -- \nWELL-MANICURED MAN Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species. (beat) Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children, (beat, then self-revealing) The only future any of us have. \nThis draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver. \nMULDER But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha. \nWELL-MANICURED MAN The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone. (beat) He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future. \n", "test2_id": 3094, "test3_input": "WIDE ON SCENE \nMulder and Scully running AT CAMERA just ahead of the collapsing center. The mass of ice around them beginning to break up. Steam vents erupting instantaneously everywhere. \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE ON SCENE \nA black dome is becoming visible through the giant circle of steam, in the ever-widening center hole that Mulder and Scully are running from. Which is chasing them to the edge of the radius. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY \nAs Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind them. Large chunks falling and bouncing off the superheated surface below, blown back up like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE \nThe Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning ice and steam.

While behind them the thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice is moving in on them. \nAnd then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone! \nThe radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a few feet beyond where they disappeared. The violent upheaval of snow abating but slightly. Beat, beat... \nTHEN THE AGENTS APPEAR AGAIN. Thrust upward by a RISING BLACK PRECIPICE which catapults them off its leading edge. As they fall the distance to the sheet of ice below. \nCUT TO: \nLOW ANGLE ON ICE SHEET \nWhere the Agents hit hard on the ice sheet. The rain of ice chunks pounding all around them. As the monolithic wall of the craft continues to rise. \nMulder trying to get to Scully in this hail of debris which he shields his face from. \nWIDE ON LEADING EDGE \nRising faster now out of the earth as it begins to increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it carried. Until the bottom of the edge of the wall appears, lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater that held it. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP \nWhere now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which is breathtaking. The domed center sloping off to a gentle gradient, which is the surface that Mulder and Scully were running on. The ship is now slowly rotating as it moves upward in a gently rising hover. \nMulder and Scully are on the ice sheet below. \nRESUME MULDER AND SCULLY \nScully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them. Looking up from this position to see: \nTHE SPACE SHIP \nMoving slowly, laterally just overhead. Thunderously rumbling. The dark detail of its underside visible in this angle. As it continues to rise, the shadow passing over Mulder and Scully. \nCUT TO: \nNEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY \nScully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches the ship's shadow cast over Mulder's SnowCat which is still parked in the distance. Moving up and off. \nThe ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT. Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for several moments during transformation. Then it disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is gone. \nMULDER \nWatches this then lays his head down on Scully's back. He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to lose consciousness. \nScully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end. Out here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world. \nThen Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her, unaware of his condition or even where she is. \nSCULLY (weakly) Mulder... \nThere is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him over, so that she can cradle him and warm him. \nHIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE \nWith the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and Scully in each others arms.

Her expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes are filled of dark, restrained defiance. \nCASSIDY ...while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing... the other events you've laid down here seem too incredible on their own, and quite frankly implausible in their connection. \nPANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably. \nSCULLY What is it you find incredible? \nCASSIDY Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism. \nSCULLY No, they don't. \nCASSIDY Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation. \nScully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A small vial. \nSCULLY I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand. \nCassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission, no further adieu. \nANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER \nWatching Scully exit. \nCASSIDY (O.S.) Mr. Skinner....? \nCAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him. \nCASSIDY Please ask Agent Scully to come back to this hearing. We're not quite finished. \nAs Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this directive, we: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY \nWe are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There is no one else around. \nUntil the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park bench. \nCLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN \nThey do not speak for several moments. A quite tension as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling, exhaling. Then: \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Congratulations on your survival. Your life is worthless now, I hope you know that. \nMULDER And yours? \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN (derisive) You think you've stopped it. What I've worked for fifty years to create. You haven't stopped it. You can't stop it. (takes a drag) You're just one man. \nMULDER You're wrong. \n", "test3_id": 3095}

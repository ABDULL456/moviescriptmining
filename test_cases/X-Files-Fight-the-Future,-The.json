Scully wearing a pained look. \nMULDER Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me. \nSCULLY All I told them was the truth. \nMULDER They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them. \nSCULLY They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up. \nMULDER (beat) What? What are you talking about? \nSCULLY I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment... \nMULDER Why? \nSCULLY I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993. \nMULDER They were the ones that put us together. \nSCULLY Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that. \nMULDER This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. \nSCULLY They're not doing this, Mulder. (off his look) I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done. \nMULDER You're... quitting? \nSCULLY There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. (off his look) Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too. \nThe door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D. Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him. \nSKINNER Agent Mulder. You're up. \nSCULLY (regretfully) I'm sorry. Good luck. \nMulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt. Before he turns and goes into the room. \nScully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings poorly disguised, too. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange. \nBARMAID I'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement. \nThe person she's talking to us: \nMULDER \nHe sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar. Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers. \nBARMAID Gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting. \nMulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his dark silence. \nBARMAID Poopy day? \nMULDER Yup. \nBARMAID A woman? (Mulder shakes his head no) Work. \nMulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly. \nANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR \nStaring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder, dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit. Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it thought. \nRESUME BARMAID, MULDER \nBARMAID What do you do? \nMULDER What do I do. (off her curious look) I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. \"Spooky,\" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time. \nShe stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured Mulder. \nBARMAID I think that about does it, Spooky. \nMULDER Does what? \nBARMAID Why don't you go home to the old lady \nMULDER Sorry. Don't have one. \nMulder slides off his stool, noticing: \n", "test1_true": "The Watchful Man is gone. \nRESUME MULDER \nHe feints toward the door, then reverses direction. Heads to the back of the place. \nINT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nMulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and exits into the alley. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT \nMulder has found a place against a wall, between two dumpsters. Jerking around in surprise at the sound of a VOICE. \nWATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE That official FBI business? \nMULDER (startled) What? \nANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAN FROM THE BAR \nHe's not far from Mulder. His name is KURTZWEIL. \nKURTZWEIL Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the same thing in Dallas. \nMulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un- threateningly. \nMULDER How's that? \nKURTZWEIL Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding. \nKurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this. \nMULDER Do I know you? \nKURTZWEIL No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that. \nMulder stares at this man as he finishes, zipping up. \nMULDER You follow me out here for a reason? \nKURTZWEIL Yeah, I did. \nKurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment; one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But Kurtzweil hails him again. \nKURTZWEIL My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. \nMULDER I know the name. Why? \nKURTZWEIL Old friend of your father's. \nKurtzweil continues peeing. Knows this got Mulder's attention. \nKURTZWEIL Back at the Department of State. We were what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine. (beat) I never believed in the Project. \nMulder stares at Kurtzweil now. He's being toyed with. He turns, opens the door into the bar. As Kurtzweil gets a little louder. \nKURTZWEIL Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't know about the Project. Your father died for it. Your sister was taken because of it. \nKurtzweil finishes nature's call. Zips up. Heads after Mulder. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT \nMulder is coming from the back. Kurtzweil moving to catch up. And he does, at the coat stand. The place has pretty much cleared out, except for the Barmaid and some help. \nMULDER How'd you find me? \nKURTZWEIL Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight. \nMULDER You a reporter? \nKURTZWEIL I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. \nMULDER Who sent you? \nKURTZWEIL I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas. \nMULDER Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab... \nMulder starts out the door, but Kurtzweil grabs his arm. \nKURTZWEIL They're going to pin Dallas on you, Agent Mulder. But there was nothing you could've done. Nothing anyone could've done to prevent that bomb from going off. Because the truth is something you'd never have guessed; never have predicted. \nMulder pulls away from Kurtzweil, but Kurtzweil dogs him to: \n", "test1_id": 3093, "test2_input": "EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT \nThe street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to the curb. \nMULDER And what's that? \nKURTZWEIL S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. \nMULDER (rhetorical disbelief) He just let it explode. \nKURTZWEIL What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? \nMULDER The Federal Building was too well guarded. \nKURTZWEIL No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing... \nMulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from Kurtzweil. \nKURTZWEIL ...the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check. \nMulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil. \nKURTZWEIL Those people were already dead. \nMULDER Before the bomb went off? \nKURTZWEIL That's what I'm saying. \nMulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment. \nMULDER Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- \nKURTZWEIL Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. \nMULDER You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...? \nKURTZWEIL And one little boy. \nMulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the window. \nMULDER I think you're full of shit. \nKURTZWEIL Do you? \nKurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL, watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play the scene out on him.) \nCUT TO: \nINT.

SCULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole. Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door. \nMULDER (strangely intense) I wake you? \nSCULLY No. \nMULDER Why not? It's three AM. \nScully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic intensity. \nSCULLY Are you drunk, Mulder? \nMULDER I was until about an hour ago. \nSCULLY Is that before or after you got the idea to come here? \nMulder looks at her curiously. \nMULDER What are you implying, Scully? \nSCULLY (frowning) I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting. \nMULDER Is that what you'd like me to do? \nScully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own wavering heart. \nSCULLY Go home, Mulder. It's late. \nMULDER Get dressed, Scully. \nSCULLY Mulder -- what are you doing? \n", "test2_true": "CUT TO: \nEXT.

But they are moving towards us, SILHOUETTES in the background of the moon. \nThey move silently, their size INCREASING as they move closer. And then we hear them, moments before they arrive at our position, UNMARKED HELICOPTERS just overhead. Hugging the ground as they blast across the dark Texas night. \nINT. UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS - NIGHT \nFlying at dangerously low altitude over the almost featureless night landscape. Heading for something that we see ahead in the distance. What looks like a LARGE GLOWING DOME surrounded by the lights of a residential area we've already seen, on the edge of suburban Dallas sprawl. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - CENTRAL TEXAS - NIGHT \nThe field where the kids had been digging has been transformed into some kind of worksite. \nA LARGE WHITE DOMED TENT has been erected over almost the entire patch of ground, surrounded by the CARGO TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about, and scientists in haz-mat suits. \nAs the UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS bank overhead. Coming in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents. CAMERA MOVING TOWARD one of the helicopters as it lightly touches down and its black door swings open. A man stepping out, and as CAMERA PUSHES UP INTO HIS FACE we recognize him as The Cigarette Smoking Man. \nThe figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth from the American people about the existence of extraterrestrial life. \nSomething known only as: \"The Project.\" \nHe walks out from under the whirring prop, just far enough to get a flame from his lighter, to get a cigarette lit. As we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. LARGE WHITE TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nA SCIENTIST in a haz-mat suit is moving through the maze of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within the tent. Areas where scientists are working at tables doing what appears to be some kind of high-tech archeological work. It is a hive of activity within, as the Scientist leads us past the REFRIGERATION UNITS to the earthen hole where Dr. Bronschweig (we've met him earlier, coming out of a med-evac chopper that landed when the tent city was erected) appears out of the earthen hole, which is reason for all this excitement. Climbing out A CLEAR HATCH which has been fashioned to cover the hole. Seeing: \nTHE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN \nNow suited up himself. Bronschweig approaches him. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN You've got something to show me. \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG (nervous excitement) Yes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ICE CAVE - CONTINUOUS \nWhat we originally established as icy, and what later became the unfrozen Texas field where the boys discovered the human skull, has been turned to its previously icy state. Thanks to two large vents that Dr. Bronschweig is pointing at: \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Brought on by what? \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six. \nThey step over to a section of the cave which has been draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this are giving off a cool blue light (passing by TWO PORTABLE DRILLING RIGS which have been erected, their pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.) Bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing A MAN lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to various and sundry machines which are monitoring his life signs. \nHis skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. His heartbeat sending life-sustaining blood and energy through his body. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN This man's still alive. \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover. \nThe CSM is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder. \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN How can this be? \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process. \nBronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard into the man's face and; then we see it. Movement. \nCLOSE ON MAN'S FACE \nThough the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can actually see through his tissue and the bones in his skull to see something IS LIVING INSIDE HIM. \nANGLE UP ON CSM AND BRONSCHWEIG \nThe Cigarette Smoking Man's mind is working intently on all the possibilities, and consequences. \nDR. BRONSCHWEIG Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates? \nCIGARETTE SMOKING MAN No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it. \nDR.

UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nMULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where soft light is penetrating through several low, arched openings. \nMulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the openings. \nANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY \nWhere Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again, pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in wonder at: \nINT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION) \nImagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony passageway, which is like countless other passageways. Which are actually ventilation ports. \nANGLE OVER MULDER \nPulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before him. Looking down to the center floor where a large central theater gives off a light different from elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down to the central theater far below are several LARGE TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to Mulder's position.) \nANGLE ON MULDER \nReacting to this. Then something captures his attention. \nMULDER'S POV \nThere on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks and architecture surrounding it. \nINT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON MULDER \nlooks beside him where the joint that connects two sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what Mulder does here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS \nWIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS \nMulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods are empty. \nMulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his way around the empty cryopods. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER \nCreeping away from us. Heading toward: \nINT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR \nWhere Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the large stadium structure. Where: \nREVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR \nWhere Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen alive. They are slowly tracking. \nWalking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having sensed: \nNEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD \nPUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and fear he's experiencing, on seeing: \nCAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE \nWhere a woman's body is encased, its naked features hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward. \nMULDER \nhurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the AMPULE. \nHastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship. \nAnd the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the syringe. \nLOW CLOSE ANGLE \non the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the substance. \nEXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS \nWhere Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the blasting all. \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS \nWe can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles. \nA small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a rush. Heading off in various directions. \nCAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow. He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip of some emotion conflicting with duty. \n", "test3_true": "MAN WHO SHOT MULDER C'mon.

BASHING, SMASHING and then finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive, her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression. \nOVER MULDER TO SCULLY \nAs he plunges the needle into Scully's arm at the front of her shoulder. To which there is an immediate reaction -- as if given a shot of adrenalin. Her eyes blinking away the cold moisture. \nMULDER Scully -- \nScully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are coming out yet. \nMULDER Breathe -- can you breathe?! \nScully is straining to do just that -- when liquid suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle. \nFinally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths that Mulder cannot discern. \nMULDER What? \nCLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY \nAs he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth. As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty breath. \nSCULLY Cold... \nMULDER Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here. \nAs she continues to suck air. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The small beams of light that lighted Mulder's way earlier are now small shafts piercing the gathering interior cloud. Illuminating: \nTHE PREHISTORIC MAN \nFrozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface of which is now etched with small streams of water running to the floor. Everything is melting and in motion. \nIncluding the CREATURE which is vaguely visible inside the frozen man. It TURNS slightly inside the body, like an animal in utero. Its eyes now looking at us, blinking. As it presses against its own fleshy container, the body of its human host. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nIt, too, is filling with misty condensation. \nVARIOUS SHOTS \nOf the ice encasing the human forms sweating and melting. \nCAMERA ADJUSTING UP TO REVEAL Mulder pulling Scully along in a fireman's carry.

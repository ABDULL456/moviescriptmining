MRS. SENNETT You're sure? 
THOMAS J It's made. 
MRS. SENNETT Come here, you've got a milk mustache. 
Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip 
THOMAS J Come on, let's go. 
VADA Bye Mrs. Sennett. 
THOMAS J Bye Ma. 
MRS. SENNETT Have fun kids. 
The two exit the house 
OUTSIDE FRONT OF SENNETT'S HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS 
VADA I'm running away. 
THOMAS J Where you running to? 
They get on their bikes and begin to ride off 
VADA California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch. 
THOMAS J I wanna live with them too. 
VADA No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family. 
THOMAS J Really? 
SOMEWHERE ON A PATHWAY IN A LIGHT FOREST, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RIDING THEIR BIKES 
Thomas J stops and then does Vada 
THOMAS J That's it. 
Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows with an annoyed look 
VADA Get up!? 
THOMAS J I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere. 
Vada sits down next to Thomas J 
THOMAS J Why are you running away? 
VADA My Dad gave Shelly a ring. 
THOMAS J Wow, was it a decoder ring? 
VADA You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring. 
THOMAS J They're getting married? 
Vada nods her head 
THOMAS J So now you'll have a mother. 
VADA I don't like her. 
THOMAS J I do, she's real funny.

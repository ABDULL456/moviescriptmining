ROBERT Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? 
He crosses towards her. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. 
JULIE What image? 
ROBERT Success. 
He sits down next to her. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and that's what they remember. Always. 
She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26. 
JULIE (QUIETLY) You're never gonna leave her. 
Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently. 
CUT TO: 
BEDROOM 
Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying. 
Robert comes up next to her, hugs her. 
ROBERT Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... 
JULIE ...Where?... 
ROBERT There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. 
She's keeps crying, but... 
JULIE Me, too. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT 
A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie rests her head on Robert's shoulder. 
And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off into a trance of desperately needed sleep until... 
A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT, flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 27. 
INT. CAR 
Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement returns... 
He looks over at Julie. 
It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck. 
Shock, followed quickly by panic. 
We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak... 
Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up. 
He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens. 
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces. 
He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to touch her, then stops. 
Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.

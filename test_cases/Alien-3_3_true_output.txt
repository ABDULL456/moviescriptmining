RIPLEY Thanks. 
JOHN You're welcome. 
They roll off each other. Her hand goes up to her nose. Blood. 
RIPLEY I'm all right. 
John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag. 
JOHN Hold this against your nose.  It'll stop the flow. 
She looks over at him questioningly. 
JOHN I'm a doctor. 
She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops. They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet. He shakes them off. 
ANTHONY No - please.  Just let me sit. Awhile. 
He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his cheek. 
ANTHONY Damn it. 
RIPLEY What was that? 
ANTHONY The reason I'm down here. 
John points to his own eyes. 
JOHN Visions. 
ANTHONY Dreams. 
RIPLEY Androids can't dream... 
ANTHONY That's probably what they thought when they built me.  But my brain is cyber- organic - patterned after the human brain - it functions the same way a human brain does.  It accumulates random images and sensations during waking hours, but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep -- 
RIPLEY Androids don't sleep. 
ANTHONY Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later models, but I don't.  Do you know what happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off the dreams while you're awake, as hallucinations.  Same thing with me. For twenty years I absorbed data on this planetoid.  A little after we lost contact with Earth the visions started.  They thought I was insane.  I had to explain that it was because I was an android. They liked that even less. 
RIPLEY What did you see? 
ANTHONY What I always see.  Images of Monsters. Demons. 
JOHN They're portents.  They stand for an evil yet to come. 
ANTHONY Just images I've absorbed from those old books and have no way to get rid of. 
RIPLEY I saw the inside of your cell. 
ANTHONY (shrugs) My head is full of them.  I try to get them out any way I can. 
His eyelids droop. 
JOHN You need sleep. 
ANTHONY I know that.  I'll settle for rest. 
He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch. 
RIPLEY Stay with him. 
Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down. 
JOHN No.  We all need rest.  You especially. 
Ripley considers him. 
JOHN Doctor's orders. 
She smiles and sits. 
JOHN Besides, you see what happens when you get ahead of us.  We should stay together. 
RIPLEY All right.  He's still above us, anyway. 
JOHN What do you mean?

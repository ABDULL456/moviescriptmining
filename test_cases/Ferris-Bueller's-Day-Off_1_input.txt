124  INT. RESTAURANT                                             124 
Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're staring at the plates. 
CAMERON What is it? 
SLOANE I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested. 
CAMERON I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us. 
Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat. 
FERRIS What are you doing? 
Cameron looks at Ferris. 
CAMERON What is this shit? 
FERRIS You got me. I don't speak French. 
He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate. 
FERRIS I think it's a land-based beefoid creature. 
He takes a bite. He savors the taste. 
FERRIS Splendid. 
CAMERON Really? 
FERRIS Superb. 
Cameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively. 
FERRIS Good? 
Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes. Ferris stops him. 
FERRIS Yo, Clouseau! 
The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly. 
FERRIS I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here? 
The waiter glances at the plates. 
WAITER Sweetbreads. 
FERRIS Uh, huh. And what might that be? 
WAITER Pancreas. 
FERRIS As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism? 
CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON 
They stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their mouths. 
CU. FERRIS 
He continues his questioning. 
FERRIS ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans? 
CU. WAITER 
He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal. 
CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON 
They look at each other. 
CU. FERRIS 
He pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue. 
CU. WAITER 
He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food. 
CU. FERRIS 
He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter. 
FERRIS Check, please!

Tom and his two GUESTS are standing at the curb, talking. A cab is waiting. The door's open. In the B.G. Ferris, Sloane and Cameron come out of the restaurant. They approach the cab. Tom's back it to Ferris. Ferris stops cold. 
FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON 
They turns on cue at Tom, now in the B.G., turns toward the restaurant. 
FERRIS 40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to. 
CAMERON We're gonna get nabbed, for sure. 
FERRIS No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go. 
He turns to the cab. Sloane and Cameron turn slowly. 
EXT. STREET. CAB 
Tom and his party are still jawing at curbside. Ferris, Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab. Behind the backs of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab. Cameron dashes in. The Ferris hops the cab.

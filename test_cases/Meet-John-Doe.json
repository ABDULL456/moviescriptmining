{"train": "MEET JOHN DOE \nWritten by Robert Riskin \nbased on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell \nExt. Bulletin Office - Sidewalk. \nClose-up: Of a time-worn plaque against the side of a building. It reads: \nTHE BULLETIN \n\"A free press for a free people.\" \nWhile we read this, a pair of hands come in holding pneumatic chisel which immediately attacks the sign. As the lettering is being obliterated, \nDissolve to: Close-up: A new plaque on which the lettering has been changed to: \nTHE NEW BULLETIN \n\"A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era.\" \nCut to: Int. Bulletin outer office. Full shot: Of a mid-western newspaper office. \nMed. shot: At a door at which a sign-painter works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's name on the door. It opens and a flip office boy emerges. The painter has to wait until the door closes in order to resume his work. \nFull shot: Of the outer office. The activity of the office seems to suddenly cease, as all eyes are centered on the office boy. \nMed. shot\u0097panning: With the office boy\u0097who has a small sheet of paper in his hand. He walks jauntily to a desk, refers to his paper, points his finger to a woman, emits a short whistle through his teeth, runs a finger across his throat and jerks his thumb toward managing editor's office. The woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy. The office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people. All watch him, terror written in their eyes. \nMed. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door where painter works. It opens and three people emerge. Two men and a girl. The girl is young and pretty. All three look dourful. The painter again has to wait for the door to shut before resuming his work. The two men exit. The girl suddenly stops. \nClose shot: Of the girl. Her name is ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels around. Camera pans with her as she returns to CONNELL's office door, flings it open and disappears. The painter remains poised with his brush, waiting for the door to swing back. There is a slight flash of resentment in his eyes. \nInt. CONNELL's office. Full shot: CONNELL is behind his desk on which is a tray of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to CONNELL's desk. \nCONNELL \n(on phone) \nYeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay. \nANN \n(supplicatingly) \nLook, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . . \nSecretary enters. (Her name is Mattie.) \nSECRETARY \nMore good luck telegrams. \nANN \nWell, you know how it is, I, I've just got to keep working. See? \nCONNELL \nSorry, sister. I was sent down here to clean house. I told yuh I can't use your column any more. It's lavender and old lace![1] \n(flicks dictograph button) \nMATTIE \n(over dictograph) \nYeah? \nCONNELL \nSend those other people in. \nMATTIE \n(over dictograph) \nOkay. \nANN \nI'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say. \nCONNELL \nIt isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers\u0097start arguments. \nANN \nOh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please. \nShe can get no further, for several people enter. They are cowed and frightened. ANN hesitates a moment, then, there being nothing for her to do, she starts to exit. She is stopped by CONNELL's voice. \nCONNELL \nAll right, come in, come in! Come in! \n(to Ann) \nCashier's got your check. \n(back to others) \nWho are these people? Gibbs, Frowley, Cunningham, Jiles\u0097 \n(to Ann at door) \nHey, you, sister! \nAnn turns. \nCONNELL \nDon't forget to get out your last column before you pick up your check! \nANN's eyes flash angrily as she exits. \nInt. Outer Office. Med. shot: ANN storms out. The painter again has to wait for the door to swing back to him. \nInt. ANN's office. Full shot: ANN enters her office and paces around, furious. A man in alpaca sleeve-bands enters. His name is JOE. \nJOE \nYou're a couple o' sticks[2] shy in your column, Ann. \nANN \n(ignores him, muttering . . .) \nA big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper\u0097and forty heads are chopped off! \nJOE \nDid you get it, too? \nANN \nYeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down! \nJOE \nBefore you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column. \nANN \nYeah. Lavender and old lace! \nSuddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes widen as a fiendish idea strikes her. \nANN \nWait, Joe\u0097wait! \nShe flops down in front of her typewriter. \nANN \n(muttering) \nWants fireworks, huh? Okay! \nShe begins to pound furiously, her jaw set. \nClose-up: Of ANN. Eyes flashing as she types. \nClose-up: Of JOE, watching her. The wild look in her eye and the unnatural speed of her typing causes him to stare dumbly at her. \nMed. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally she finishes. She whips the sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to JOE. \nANN \nHere. \nAs JOE takes it, ANN begins to empty the drawers of her desk. \nNow, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard. \nCONNELL \nSo? \nFull shot: Of the whole group. BEANY grins in admiration. CONNELL has leaned back in his chair, his eyes glued on ANN. \nANN \nSo! So he writes me a letter and I dig him up. He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: \"I protest, by John Doe.\" He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man. \nArguments will start. Should he commit suicide or should he not! People will write in pleading with him. But no! No, sir! John Doe will remain adamant! On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes! See? \nShe finishes, takes a deep breath\u0097awed, and at the same time proud of her accomplishment. \nClose shot: Of CONNELL. He just stares at ANN. \nCONNELL \n(after a pause\u0097quietly) \nVery pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve? \nANN \nJohn Doe. \nCONNELL \n(loses control\u0097screams) \nWhat John Doe? \nANN \n(screams right back) \nThe one we hire for the job, you lunkhead! \nThere is silence for a moment. \nCONNELL \n(breaking silence\u0097speaks with a controlled patience) \nWait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it? \nANN \n(nodding) \nWell, you're catching on. \nCONNELL \nWho, for instance? \nANN \nAnybody! Er, er\u0097Beany'll do! \nClose-up: BEANY. He is petrified. \nBEANY \nWhy sure\u0097Who? Me? Jump off a\u0097Oh, no! Any time but Christmas. I'm superstitious. \nFull shot: BEANY backs away from them\u0097and when he gets to the door\u0097makes a dash for it. \nInt. Outer office: Med. shot: At door. As BEANY comes dashing out, he almost upsets the painter from the stool. When the door is shut, the name of \"Connell\" which he has been printing is all smudged over. The painter stares at it, helplessly for a second, and then\u0097unable to stand it any more, rises, throws his brush violently to the floor\u0097after completely smearing the sign himself. \nFull shot: \nCONNELL \n(sighing) \nMiss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies\u0097but stay out o' newspaper business! \nPOP \nBetter get that story in, Hank, it's getting late. \nANN \n(to CONNELL) \nYou're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place. \nCONNELL \nHoly smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman. \nHe crosses to his desk just as NED enters from the back door. \nNED \nLook, Chief! Look what the Chronicle is running on John Doe. They say it's a fake! \nCONNELL turns sharply. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She was just about giving up, when she hears this\u0097and her eyes brighten alertly. \nMed. shot: At CONNELL's desk. CONNELL\u0097reading the paper\u0097becomes incensed. \nCONNELL \nWhy, the no-good\u0097low-down\u0097 \n(reading) \n\"John Doe story amateur journalism. It's palpably phoney. It's a wonder anyone is taking it seriously.\" What do yuh think of those guys! \nANN has walked into scene while CONNELL is reading. \nANN \nThat's fine! That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this! \nCONNELL \n(doesn't like Ned hearing all this) \nThat's all, Ned. Thank you. \nNED \nAll right. \nNED, puzzled, exits. CONNELL comes away from his desk and walks around. \nCONNELL \n(fighting spirit) \n\"Amateur journalism\", huh? Why, the bunch of sophomores! I can teach them more about\u0097 \nBut he is interrupted by the front door being flung open. On the threshold stands BEANY. \nBEANY \nHey, boss. Get a load of this. \nCONNELL \n(joins him in the doorway) \nWhat? \nBEANY \nLook! \nMed. shot: Over their shoulders. In the outer office are a large group of derelict-looking men. Some standing\u0097some sitting\u0097some leaning. It looks like the lobby of a flophouse had been transplanted. \nClose shot: Beany and Connell. \nCONNELL \nWhat do they want? \nBEANY \nThey all say they wrote the John Doe letter. \nMed. shot: POP and ANN have walked over and also peer out. \nCONNELL \n(amused, turns) \nOh, they all wrote the letter? \nANN pushes CONNELL aside\u0097talks to BEANY. \nMed. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested. \nCONNELL \nHow about family? Got any family? \nTALL CHAP \n(after a pause) \nNo. \nCONNELL \nOh, just traveling through, huh? \nTALL CHAP \nYeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside. \nCONNELL nods to the others to join him in a huddle. He crosses to a corner. They follow. \nClose three shot: They speak in subdued voices. \nCONNELL \nLooks all right\u0097 \nANN \nHe's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American! \nCONNELL \nI wish he had a family, though. \nPOP \nBe less complicated without a family. \nANN \nLook at that face. It's wonderful. They'll believe him . Come on. \nClose-up: Of TALL CHAP. He is a strange, bewildered figure. He knows he is being appraised, but doesn't know why. He fingers his hat nervously and looks around the room. Suddenly he is attracted by something. \nClose-up: Of tray of sandwiches on CONNELL's desk. \nClose-up: Of TALL CHAP. He swallows hard. His eyes stare at the sandwiches hungrily. \nMed. shot: Over his shoulder. Shooting toward the huddling group. It breaks up. They walk toward him. \nMed. shot: Another angle. \nCONNELL \nWhat's your name? \nTALL CHAP \nWilloughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball. \nANN \nEr, would you, er, would you like to make some money? \nJOHN \nYeah, maybe. \nNOTE: Henceforth in this script he shall be referred to as JOHN DOE. \nANN \nWould you be willing to say you wrote that letter\u0097and stick by it? \nJOHN \nOh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe. \nThere is an appraising pause, and CONNELL again signals them to join him in a huddle. They exit to their corner. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. His eyes immediately go to the sandwiches. \nClose-up: Of tray, with sandwiches and milk, on desk. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. His eyes riveted on tray. He glances, speculatively, over toward them and then back to the tray. \nMed. shot: Of the huddled group. \nANN \nThat's our man. He's made to order. \nCONNELL \nI don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line. \nANN \n(it's significant to her) \nWhen you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you. \nSuddenly, they are startled by a loud thud: they all look around sharply. \nANN \nHe's fainted! Get some water quickly! \nAs all three rush to him. \nCONNELL \nHurry up, Pop. \nANN \nOh. \nCONNELL \n(to John) \nRight here. Sit down. \nJOHN \nHuh? \nANN \nAre you all right? \nJOHN \nYeah, I'm all right. \nDissolve to: Int. ANN's office. Close-up: Of JOHN\u0097sitting at ANN's desk, just completing a meal\u0097and still eating voraciously. \nCamera draws back and we find another bindle-stiff sitting beside JOHN, packing food away in silence. He is the friend JOHN referred to. He is much older and goes by the name of COLONEL. \nCamera continues to pull back revealing ANN who sits nearby, watching them sympathetically. \nClose shot: JOHN and the COLONEL. They continue eating. JOHN glances up and catches ANN's eye. He smiles self-consciously. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She, too, smiles warmly. \nMed. shot: They continue to eat silently. \nANN \nHow many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you? \nCOLONEL \nSay, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me. \nANN \nWell, nobody asked yuh. \nCOLONEL \nTrying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you! \nJOHN \n(to Ann) \nDon't mind the Colonel. He hates people. \nANN \nHe likes you well enough to stick around. \nBEANY \nOkay, fellas. \nThree bruisers stand in the doorway. \nBEANY \nNow, lemme see. You sit outside the door. Nobody comes in, see. You two fellas sit in here. \nAs they reach for chairs, \nCut to: Med. shot: JOHN is pleased as his gaze wanders around the room. \nJOHN \nHey, pretty nifty, huh? \nCOLONEL \nYou ain't gonna get me to stay here. \nJOHN \nSure, you are. \nCOLONEL \nNo, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me. \nWhile he speaks, JOHN has managed to get a glimpse of himself in a mirror\u0097admiring his new suit. \nBELL HOP \nHey, what'll I do with this baggage? \nBEANY \nAw, stick 'em in the bedroom. \nCOLONEL \nGimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh? \nJOHN \nSure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did. \nCOLONEL \nAw, Long John . . . I tell you\u0097it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! \n(as John brings out harmonica) \nJOHN \nStop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this. \nWider shot: As BEANY enters scene with box of cigars. \nBEANY \nHere's some cigars the boss sent up. Have one. \nJOHN's eyes light up. \nJOHN \nHey, cigars! \nHe grabs one and stuffs it in his mouth. \nBEANY \n(to Colonel) \nHelp yourself. \nCOLONEL \nNaw. \nJOHN flops into a luxurious chair\u0097and immediately ANGELFACE holds a light up for his cigar. JOHN looks up, pleased. \nJOHN \nSay, I'll bet yuh even the Major Leaguers don't rate an outfit like this. \nANGELFACE \n(hands him a newspaper) \nHere. Make yourself comfortable. \n(turns to the Colonel) \nPaper? \nCOLONEL \n(sharply) \nI don't read no papers and I don't listen to radios either. I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber and I don't have to read it. \nANGELFACE backs away, puzzled. \nCOLONEL \n(crosses to John) \nI've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy\u0097 \nBEANY \nHey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom? \nJOHN \nNo. \nBEANY beckons to him to follow, which JOHN does with great interest. \nInt. bedroom: Full shot: As BEANY and JOHN puff luxuriously on their cigars and examine the room. \nCOLONEL \n(in doorway) \nThe first thing that happens to a guy like that\u0097he starts wantin' to go into restaurants and sit at a table and eat salads\u0097and cup cakes\u0097and tea\u0097 \n(disgusted) \nBoy, what that kinda food does to your system! \nJOHN pushes on the bed and is impressed with its softness. \nCOLONEL \nThe next thing the dope wants is a room. Yessir, a room with steam heat! And curtains and rugs \nand 'fore you know it, he's all softened up and he can't sleep 'less he has a bed. \nClose-up: Of BEANY. He stares, bewildered, at the COLONEL. \nWider shot: JOHN turns and crosses to window. \nJOHN \n(as he goes) \nHey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me. \nCOLONEL \nI seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account! \nBEANY \n(can't stand it any more) \nHey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway? \nCOLONEL \n(ignoring him) \nAnd let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yessir, they got you! \nBEANY \nWho's got him? \nCOLONEL \nThe heelots! \nJOHN hangs up. \nThe COLONEL has just reached the door when it flies open and Ann comes in with photographer EDDIE\u0097she sees JOHN all dressed up. \nANN \nHello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town! \nEDDIE \nAll set, Ann? \nANN \n(coming out of it) \nHuh? Oh, yes. Let's go. \n(she backs away) \nNow, let's see. We want some action in these pictures. \nJOHN \nAction? \nANN \nUm-hum. \nJOHN winds up in pitching pose\u0097his left leg lifted up high. \nEDDIE \nThat's good. \nANN \nNo, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof. \nEDDIE \nOh. \nANN \nHere. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better. \nClose shot: She combs his hair\u0097straightens his tie\u0097etc. He inhales the fragrance of her hair and likes it\u0097winks to the others. She poses JOHN's face and looks it over. \nANN \nYou know, he's got a nice face, hasn't he? \nANGELFACE \nYeh\u0097he's pretty. \nJOHN gives him a look and starts to get up slowly. \nANN \nHere. Sit down! \n(to ANGELFACE) \nQuiet, egghead! \n(back to JOHN) \nAll right, now, a serious expression. \nJOHN \n(laughing) \nCan't. I'm feeling too good. \nANN \nOh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization. \nJOHN \nWith all of it? \nANN \nYes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now. \nJOHN \nOh, crabby guy, huh? \nHe tries scowling. \nANN \nYeah. No, no! \n(laughing) \nNo! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! \n(the men laugh) \nJOHN \nWell, all those guys in the bleachers think\u0097 \nANN \nNever mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest. \nJOHN \nAgainst what? \nANN \nAgainst anything. Just protest. \nJOHN \n(laughing) \nYou got me. \nANN \nOh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do? \nJOHN \n(advances toward her) \nOh, yuh did, huh? \nANN \nYes! \nJOHN \nWhy can't you call right, you bone-headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied\u0097 \nANN \nGrab it, Eddie, grab it! \nEddie takes the picture. \nA Montage: Of Newspaper inserts featuring John Doe's picture. \n\"I protest against collapse of decency in the world.\" \n\"I protest against corruption in local politics.\" \n\"I protest against civic heads being in league with crime.\" \n\"I protest against state relief being used as political football.\" \n\"I protest against County Hospitals shutting out the needy.\" \n\"I protest against all the brutality and slaughter in the world.\" \nClose-up: Superimposed over all of the above is a circulation chart\u0097showing the circulation of the Bulletin in a constant rise. \nDissolve to: Int. GOVERNOR's study: Med. shot: The GOVERNOR paces furiously. In front of him are several associates. \nGOVERNOR \nI don't care whose picture they're publishing. I still say that this John Doe person is a myth. And you can quote me on that. And I'm going to insist on his being produced for questioning. You know as well as I do that this whole thing is being engineered by a vicious man with a vicious purpose\u0097Mr. D. B. Norton. \nAs he finishes saying this, Dissolve to: Ext. D. B.'s estate: \nThat's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it. \nANN'S eyes brighten with excitement. They are interrupted by the arrival of TED SHELDON, in uniform. \nD. B. \n(to TED) \nHello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er\u0097 \n(laughing) \nThis is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell. \nANN \nHow do you do. \nTED \nHow do you do! \nD. B. \nAll right, Casanova. I'll give you a break. See that Miss Mitchell gets a car to take her home. \nTED \nAlways reading my mind, aren't you? \nANN \n(laughing) \nThank you very much for everything. \nD. B. \nAnd, Miss Mitchell\u0097I think from now on you'd better work directly with me. \nANN \nYes, sir. \nThey exit. D. B. walks to the door, a pleased expression on his face. \nClose-up: Of D. B. His face wreathed in a victorious smile. \nFade-out. \nFade-in: Int. ANN's living room: Close shot: Of ANN. She sits at a typewriter reading something she has written. Suddenly, impulsively, she yanks the sheet out of the machine and flings it to the floor. As she rises, camera pulls back. We find the floor littered with previously unsuccessful attempts to get the speech written. For a moment, ANN paces agitatedly, until she is interrupted by a commotion. \nMed. Shot: At door. ANN's two sisters, IRENE and ELLEN, aged nine and eleven\u0097and dressed in their sleeping pajamas, dash in, squealing mischievously. Camera pans with them as they rush to ANN and leap on her. \nANN \nOh! Hey! Oh, hey! I thought you were asleep! \nELLEN \nWe just wanted to say good night, Sis. \nThey embrace and kiss her. \nANN \nOh, oh! Oh, you little brats! You're just stalling. I said good night! \nMed. shot: At door. ANN'S MOTHER appears in the doorway. She is a prim little woman\u0097her clothes have a touch of the Victorian about them\u0097her hair is done up in old-fashioned style, her throat is modestly covered in lace. \nMOTHER \n(above the din) \nCome, come, come, children. It's past your bedtime. \nELLEN \nOh, all right. \nMOTHER \nGo on! \nELLEN \nCome on, Pooch! Come on, come on. \nMOTHER \nNow, keep Pooch off the bed. \nThe CHILDREN exit, squealing. ANN'S MOTHER goes to ANN's desk and searches for something. \nANN \nStick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right. \nMOTHER \nOh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever. \nANN \nYeah, I know. What are you looking for? \nMOTHER \nYour purse. I need ten dollars. \nANN \nWhat for? I gave you fifty just the other day. \nMOTHER \nYes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house\u0097and then this morning the Community Chest[7] lady came around and\u0097 \nANN \nAnd the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for? \nMOTHER \nThe Websters. \nANN \nThe Websters! \nMOTHER \nYou remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor\u0097 \nANN \nYou're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves? \nMOTHER \nWell, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now. \nANN \nIf you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away. \nHer MOTHER looks up, surprised at her tone. \nMRS. MITCHELL \nOh, Ann, dear! \nClose-up: ANN realizes she has spoken sharply to her MOTHER and immediately regrets it. Her face softens. \nMed. shot: As ANN crosses to her MOTHER\u0097and places an arm around her shoulder, tenderly. \nANN \nOh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies! \nMOTHER \nDo you mean the speech you're writing? \nANN \nYeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell! I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good! \nMOTHER \nWell, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen. \nANN \nWhat? \nLUG \nWhat's the score, Angelface? \nANGELFACE \nThree to two\u0097our favor. \nLUG \nGee, that's great! \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He has heard this and grins mischievously. He starts winding up for another pitch. \nClose-up: Of MIKE. He looks around mischievously, then turns to JOHN. \nMIKE \nYou've got swell form. Must have been a pretty good pitcher. \nWider shot: JOHN is just receiving the ball. \nJOHN \nPretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game! \nMIKE \nNineteen! \nJOHN \nYep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up. \nMIKE \n(picks up newspaper\u0097sighing) \nThat's too bad. \nJOHN \nWhat do you mean, too bad? \nMIKE \n(pretending distraction) \nHuh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again. \nJOHN \nWell, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a\u0097 \nMIKE \n(interrupting carelessly) \nWell, you know how they are in baseball\u0097if a guy's mixed up in a racket\u0097 \nJOHN \n(walking over) \nRacket? What do you mean? \nMIKE \nWell, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you? \nJOHN \nY-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh! \nMIKE \nAnd another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you? \n(shakes his head) \nClose shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove\u0097flopped into a chair\u0097and has taken out his ocarina. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nHey, did you hear that, Colonel? \nThe COLONEL nods, disinterestedly, and begins to play. \nWider shot: JOHN ponders his dilemma for a second. \nJOHN \nI gotta figure some way out of this thing! \nCOLONEL \nThe elevators are still runnin'. \nMIKE \n(carelessly) \nI know one way you can do it. \nJOHN \nHow? \nMIKE \nWell, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born! \nJohn thinks this over, but something troubles him. \nJOHN \nYeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed? \nMIKE \nWell, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth. \nCOLONEL \n(eyes popping) \nFive thousand dollars? \nMIKE \nYeah. Five thousand dollars. And he gets it right away. You don't have to wait till Christmas. \nCOLONEL \nLook out, Long John! They're closing in on you! \nJOHN \n(ignores COLONEL) \nSay, who's putting up this dough? \nMIKE \nFeller runs the Chronicle . \n(takes it out of his pocket) \nHere's the speech you make\u0097and it's all written out for you. \nJOHN takes it. \nClose-up: Of the COLONEL. \nCOLONEL \n(eyes heaven-ward) \nFive thousand dollars! Holy mackerel! I can see the heelots comin'. The whole army of them! \nMIKE \nIt's on the level. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. \nDissolve to: Int. broadcasting station: \nClose shot: TELEPHONE OPERATORS. \n1ST GIRL \nNo, I'm sorry. Tickets for the broadcast are all gone. Phone the Bulletin. \n2ND GIRL \nNow, you can't be a stranger to any guy that's on your own team. So tear down the fence that separates you, tear down the fence and you'll tear down a lot of hates and prejudices! Tear down all the fences in the country and you'll really have teamwork! \nMed. shot: Around BEANY and the LUGS. They, too, are interested. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nI know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: \"He's asking for a miracle to happen. He's expecting people to change all of a sudden.\" Well, you're wrong. It's no miracle. It's no miracle because I see it happen once every year. And so do you. At Christmas time! There's something swell about the spirit of Christmas, to see what it does to people, all kinds of people . . . \nClose-up: Of ANN. Her eyes go from JOHN to the audience\u0097as she watches their reaction. \nFull shot: Shooting toward audience over JOHN's shoulder. \nJOHN \nNow, why can't that spirit, that same warm Christmas spirit last the whole year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if each and every John Doe would make that spirit last three hundred and sixty-five days out of the year, we'd develop such a strength, we'd create such a tidal wave of good will, that no human force could stand against it. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He has become visibly affected by the speech himself. \nJOHN \nYes, sir, my friends, the meek can only inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You'd better start right now. Don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness! Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of the world! \nHe has finished\u0097but does not move. He drops his head to conceal the moisture in his eyes. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She, too, remains seated. Her moist eyes riveted on JOHN. \nMed. long shot: Of Audience. There is no outburst of applause. All continue to stare forward, emotionally touched. \nMed. shot: Of ANN. She runs over to John. \nANN \nJohn! You were wonderful! \nMed. shot: Of the audience. They too realize it is over\u0097and gradually they rise and applaud him wildly, and the radio station rings with cheers. \nMed. shot: JOHN and ANN. JOHN stares at ANN, then turns to COLONEL. \nJOHN \n(as he reaches COLONEL) \nLet's get out of here. \nThey exit through the door at which the COLONEL has been on guard. \nCOLONEL \nNow you're talking! \nMed. shot: At side door. The COLONEL opens it, and a little crowd of autograph hounds wait for JOHN. \nCOLONEL \nGangway, you heelots! \nThey push their way to a taxi waiting at the curb. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She stares at them leaving, follows and tries to stop them, but her efforts are unsuccessful. \nDissolve to: Ext. under a bridge: Med. shot: JOHN and the COLONEL are in a secluded spot. The lights of the city can be seen in the distance. The COLONEL is building a fire. \nCOLONEL \nI knew you'd wake up sooner or later! Boy, am I glad we got out of that mess. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He reaches around and pulls his pitcher's glove out of his back pocket, and starts pounding his fist into it. \nJOHN \nI had that five thousand bucks sewed up! Could have been on my way to old Doc Brown! \n(imitates Ann) \n\"You're a pitcher, John,\" she said, \"Now go in there and pitch! \n(self-beratingly) \nWhat a sucker! \nWider shot: To include the COLONEL, who has quite a mound of twigs built, under which he lights a match. \nCOLONEL \nYeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her. \nJOHN \nWhat was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . . \nCOLONEL \nTear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you! \nJOHN \nFive thousand bucks! I had it right in my hand! \nDissolve to: Int. D.B.'s study: Close-up: D.B. on telephone. \nD.B. \nWhat do you mean, he ran away? Well, go after him! Find him! That man is terrific! \nDissolve to: Ext. a box car (process). Close shot: Of JOHN and the COLONEL. They play a duet on their instruments. \nFade out: \nFade in: Ext. a small town street\u0097day: Med. shot: As JOHN and the COLONEL come from around a corner. Camera pans with them as they enter \"Dan's Beanery\". \nInt. DAN's Beanery: Full shot: They enter and flop down on stools. Half a dozen other customers are present. \nMed. shot: Kids dancing to phonograph. \nCOLONEL \nJitterbugs.[9] \nClose shot: JOHN and the COLONEL. \nJOHN \nYeh. Say, how much money we got left? \nCOLONEL \nFour bits. \nJOHN \nBetter make it doughnuts, huh? \nCOLONEL \nYeh. \nDAN \nWhat'll it be, gents? \nJOHN \nHave you got a coupla steaks about that big and about that thick? \n(measuring) \nCOLONEL \nEr, yeh, with hash-brown potatoes and tomatoes and\u0097and apple pie and ice cream and coffee\u0097 \nDAN \nAnd doughnuts! I know. Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a pair! \nMA'S VOICE \nSinkers, a pair, coming up. \nCOLONEL \nGlad he took the \"T\" out of that. \nJOHN \n(sees something off\u0097nudges the Colonel) \nHey look! \nLong shot: Shooting from their view through the store window. In the street outside, a delivery wagon is passing. On its side is a sign reading \"JOIN THE JOHN DOE CLUB\". \nInt. DAN's beanery: Close-up: JOHN and the COLONEL. \nCOLONEL \nJoin the John Doe Club. \nJOHN \nHello. \nD. B. \nMister Mayor, if you don't mind, we'd like to talk to him alone. \nMAYOR \nWhy, certainly, certainly. All right, everybody, clear out. \nThey all start to shuffle out\u0097the MAYOR excitedly egging them on. \nMAYOR'S WIFE \nQuit pushing. \nMAYOR \nDon't argue with me here. Wait till we get home. \nWIFE \nDon't you push me around like that! Even though I'm your wife, you can't push me around\u0097 \nMAYOR \nOhhhh! \nThey all shuffle out, and D.B. shuts the door. JOHN watches him, doesn't like his proprietary manner. \nJOHN \nLook, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here. \nD. B. \nThere's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. \n(laughing) \nIt's only natural that people\u0097 \nJOHN \nWell, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby. \nANN \n(gets in front of him\u0097pleads) \nLook, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going\u0097 \nJOHN \n(interested despite himself) \nJohn Doe Clubs? What for? \nANN \nUh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech. \nJOHN \n(regains his former attitude) \nI don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either. \nANN \nOh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you. \nJOHN \nLook, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it? \nANN \nUh-huh . . . \nJOHN \nWell, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone? \nANN \nOh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour. \nJOHN \nMe? \nANN \nUh-huh. \nD. B. \nWhy, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement. \nJOHN \nSay, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here. \nANN \nJohn! \nThe beaming COLONEL starts to follow him to the door. When they get there, the door suddenly flies open and a crowd of townspeople push their way in\u0097with the MAYOR and the SHERIFF trying to hold them back. \nMAYOR \nPlease, please! I just got rid of one crowd. \nWOMAN \nOh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him the John Doe Club wants to talk to him. \nClose-up: Of D. B. He gets an idea. These people might influence JOHN. \nD. B. \nLet them in, Mr. Mayor. Let them come in. \nFull shot: As the MAYOR and the SHERIFF back away. \nMAYOR \nOkay, folks, but remember your manners. No stampeding. Walk slow, like you do when you come to pay your taxes. \nMed. shot: Of the group. They shuffle forward grinning happily. Those in the rear rise on tiptoes for a better look. The men doff their hats as they come forward. \nMed. shot: Of JOHN, the COLONEL, ANN and D.B. John glances around nervously. The COLONEL is worried. \nMed. shot: Of the townspeople. They just stand there, awkwardly, some grinning sheepishly, others staring at JOHN. Finally someone nudges a young man in the foreground and whispers. \nSOMEONE \nCome on, Bert. \nBERT \nOkay. All right, give me a chance. \nWOMAN \n(making room for him) \nCome right in. \nWider shot: As the group around JOHN wait expectantly. \nBERT \n(clearing throat) \nMy name's Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe, I'm the head soda jerker at Schwabacher's Drug Store. \nClose shot: Of BERT\u0097as he plunges into his story. \nBERT \nWell, sir, you see, me and my wife, we heard your broadcast, and we got quite a bang out of it, especially my wife. \nWider shot: To include JOHN and the others. \nBERT \nKept me up half the night saying \"That man's right, honey. The trouble with the world is\u0097nobody gives a hoot about his neighbor. That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other.\" \nAnd I kept saying, \"Well, that's fine, but how's a guy gonna go around loving the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss for instance!\" \n(laughing) \nHe'll be ready on time. He's packing now. \nCHARLIE \nAh, good! \n(crosses to Ann) \nDid you see his picture on the cover of Time ? \nANN \nYeah. \nCHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk in front of her. ANN glances at it, unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to a table where there are several bottles of coca-cola and starts to pour himself a drink. \nCHARLIE \nI gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. I've handled a good many big promotions in my time . . . everything from the world's fair to a channel swimmer, but this one has certainly got me spinning. And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! Say! If you could only get him to jump off the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million people there. \nANN \nCharlie! \nANN is lost in troubled thought. \nCHARLIE'S VOICE \nHuh? \nANN \n(nods toward door) \nWhat do you make of him? \nTwo shot: CHARLIE and ANN. \nCHARLIE \nWho, Johnny-boy? \nANN nods. \nCHARLIE \nWell, I don't know what angle you want, but I'll give it to you quick. Number one, he's got great yokel appeal; but he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning to believe he really wrote that original suicide letter that you made up. Number three, he thinks that you're Joan of Arc or something! \nClose-up: Of ANN. This is definitely troublesome to her. \nANN \n(hoarsely) \nYeah, I know. \nWider shot: ANN walks away\u0097pacing perturbedly. \nCHARLIE \nNumber four, well, you know what number four is. He's nuts about you. Yeah, it's running out of his ears. \nANN runs her hand through her hair. Suddenly she wheels around to CHARLIE. \nANN \nYou left out number five. We're all heels, me especially. \nShe returns to her packing. CHARLIE watches her a second. \nCHARLIE \nHoly smoke! \nThey are interrupted by a knock on the door. \nANN \n(calling) \nCome in. \nJOHN enters, carrying a suitcase. \nJOHN \nI'm all packed. \nCHARLIE \n(starts out) \nGood. I'll go and get Beany-boy. \nJOHN \n(kidding him) \nOkay, Charlie-boy! \nCHARLIE \nHuh? \n(laughing)[10] \nCHARLIE winks good-naturedly and exits. JOHN turns to ANN, who concentrates on her packing. \nMed. shot: He looks at ANN with great interest, and walks toward her, camera panning with him. ANN feels him coming, but does not turn. \nJOHN \n(after a pause) \nCan I help you pack? \nANN \nNo, thank you. \nJOHN wanders over to a chair and sits on the edge\u0097watching her. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She is conscious of his eyes on her and fumbles with her packing. Finally she turns. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He stares at her, a warm smile on his face. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She becomes self-conscious and resumes her packing. \nMed. shot: JOHN. \nJOHN \nDo you care if I sit down out here? \nANN \nNo. \nA broad smile appears on JOHN'S face. \nJOHN \n(laughing) \nYou know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you. \nANN \nAbout me? \nJOHN \n(laughing) \nSure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father. \nClose-up: Of ANN. The fact that he has seen himself in the image of her father disturbs her. She turns slowly. \nTwo shot: JOHN clears his throat nervously. \nJOHN \nThere was, there was something I was trying to stop you from doing. So, er, so I got up out of bed and I walked right through the wall here, right straight into your room. \n(laughing) \nYou know how dreams are. \nANN stares at him\u0097fearful of the trend his dream is taking. \nJOHN \nAnd there you were in bed. \n(quickly apologizing) \nANN is deeply concerned. She watches him, helplessly. \nJOHN \n(continuing) \nYou know, I never thought much about people before. They were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers. The only time I worried about them was if they\u0097is when they didn't come in to see me pitch. You know, lately I've been watching them while I talked to them. I could see something in their faces. I could feel that they were hungry for something. Do you know what I mean? \nANN nods. \nJOHN \nMaybe that's why they came. Maybe they were just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life. \nANN forces a smile. The moment threatens to become awkward\u0097until they are saved by the pilot's voice. \nPILOT \nAll aboard, folks! \nThey suddenly snap out of their mood\u0097and as they rise: \nFade out. \nFade in: Int. D. B.'s dining room. Full shot: As D. B., ANN and TED SHELDON enter and cross to table. ANN starts to sit and notices a fur coat flung over the back of the chair. \nANN \nOh, somebody else sitting there? \nD. B. \nNo, no, no\u0097that's your seat. \nTED \nAnd this is your coat. \nANN \nMine? \nD. B. \nA little token of appreciation. \nAnn pauses a moment, glances toward D. B.\u0097while TED throws the coat over her shoulders. \nANN \n(glances into a mirror) \nOh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well\u0097I don't quite know what to say . . . \nD. B. \nWell, don't say anything at all. Just sit down. \nClose-up: Of ANN. She sits down, picks up her serviette\u0097and something she sees suddenly makes her look with surprise at D. B. \nCamera pans down to a jewel box which had been under the serviette. \nCamera pans back to ANN. She glances up at D. B. somewhat bewildered. \nANN \nOh! \nD. B. \nGo ahead, open it, open it. \nANN opens the box and holds up a lovely diamond bracelet. Her eyes dance. \nANN \nOh! Oh, it's lovely! \nTED \nAnd a new contract goes with it. \nWider shot: D. B. and TED exchange satisfied glances. ANN admires the bracelet on her wrist\u0097and then turns to D. B., looks directly at him. \nANN \n(shrewdly) \nWell, come on, spring it! You've got something on your mind. \nD. B. laughs. \nANN \nMust be stupendous. \nWider shot: As D. B. roars with laughter. \nD. B. \nYou know, that's what I like about her. Right to the point, like that! All right, practical Annie, here it is. \nHe leans forward. ANN waits. TED watches her face. \nTwo shot: ANN and D. B. \nD. B. \nTomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party. \nANN \n(eyes widening) \nA third party? \nD. B. \nYes. The John Doe Party. \nWider shot: TED watches ANN, expectantly. \nD. B. \nDevoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have. \nANN \n(in an awed whisper) \nMr. D. B. Norton! \nD. B. verifies her guess by leaning back, a pleased grin on his face, his huge chest expanded. \nD. B. \nYes. \nAnn looks from one to the other, a little awed by the size of the project. \nANN \n(on her breath) \nWow! \nDissolve to: Int. broadcasting booth\u0097ball park\u0097night. Med. shot: The place is a bee-hive of activity. Announcers walk about with \"mikes\" in their hands\u0097all speaking at once\u0097as they describe the scene below. \nClose shot: Of N.B.C. ANNOUNCER \nN.B.C. ANNOUNCER \nAnd although the opening of the convention is hours off, the delegates are already pouring into the ball park by the droves, with lunch baskets, banners and petitions, asking John Doe not to jump off any roof . . . \nCamera pans over to KNOX MANNING. \nKNOX MANNING \nIt is still a phenomenal movement. The John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've heard people call them, have been laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe. \nCamera pans over to JOHN B. HUGHES. \nJOHN B. HUGHES \nAnd in these days of wars and bombings, it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country, an idea based on friendliness, on giving and not taking, on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return. And if a thing like this can happen, don't let any of our grumbling friends tell you that humanity is falling apart. This is John B. Hughes, signing off now and returning you to our main studio until nine o'clock when the convention will officially open. \nDissolve to: Int. ANN's living room. Med. shot: At Door. ANN's MOTHER opens it and JOHN stands on the threshold. He has a small box of flowers in his hand. Water drips from his hat. \nMRS. MITCHELL \nOh, John. Come in. \nJOHN \nSay, I'm kinda\u0097it's raining out a little\u0097 \nMRS. MITCHELL \nYou mean you'd like me to do it, huh? \nJOHN \nWell, I was thinking that\u0097Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice. \nClose-up of MOTHER. She doesn't know how she can, with her present strained relationship with ANN, but JOHN's sincerity touches her. \nMOTHER \nOf course I will, John. \nTwo shot: JOHN's face lights up, gratefully. \nJOHN \nGee whiz! Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell. \n(grabs her hand) \nGee, you're\u0097uh\u0097you're okay! \nHe exits from scene\u0097but almost immediately he is back. He plants a kiss on her cheek and goes. \nCut to: Ext. sidewalk. Front of ANN's apartment. Med. Shot: An automobile stands at the curb, in front of which is BEANY. Also waiting, are four motorcycle policeman. \nBEANY \n(to the other men) \nThis John Doe meeting is gonna be one of the biggest things that ever happened. \nAs JOHN appears in the doorway of the apartment house, he pretends to throw a baseball at them. \nBEANY \nWhy, they're coming from all over; trains, box cars, wagons\u0097 \n(sees JOHN) \nlook out! \nMed. Shot: Reverse angle. As BEANY holds the door open for JOHN. \nJOHN \nHello, bodyguards! Hey, had your dinner yet? \nBODYGUARD \nNot yet. \nJOHN \nWell, look. No. Go ahead and have your dinner. I'll\u0097 \nHe is about to enter the car when a voice from off-scene stops him. \nCONNELL'S VOICE \nWait a minute, John. \nCamera pans over to a taxicab which has just driven in. CONNELL hands the driver a bill and walks, rather unsteadily toward JOHN. \nMed. shot: Around BEANY's car. CONNELL ambles into the scene. \nJOHN \nHello, Mr. Connell. \nCONNELL \nHiyah, John. \n(broad wink) \nJohn, I want to have a little talk with you. \n(lurches\u0097John holds him up) \nWhat's the matter\u0097are you falling? Come here. \nTakes his arm to lead him off. \nBEANY \n(protesting) \nHey, Boss. \nCONNELL \nOh, quiet, quiet, quiet. \n(to John) \nSay, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight? \nJOHN \nNo, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way. \nCONNELL \n(wisely) \nUh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk. \nBEANY \n(protesting) \nGee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute. \nCONNELL \n(shooing him away) \nGo on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street. \nHe points in the general direction and again takes JOHN's arm. JOHN watches him, rather amused to see CONNELL off his milk diet, and allows himself to be led away. \nWipe to: Int. a barroom. Close shot: In a corner booth, JOHN and CONNELL sit, close together, drinks in front of them. JOHN's drink has remained untouched. CONNELL is just taking a long swig. From off-scene we hear the strains of an old-fashioned torch ballad, coming from an automatic piano. \nCONNELL \n(after a pause) \nYou're a nice guy, John. I like you. You're gentle. I like gentle people. Me? I'm hard\u0097hard and tough. \n(shakes his head\u0097disparagingly) \nI got no use for hard people. Gotta be gentle to suit me. Like you, for instance. \nJOHN smiles, amused at him. CONNELL starts to light his cigarette, which is bent. He hold the match up, but it never reaches the tip of the bent cigarette. He puffs, satisfied. \nCONNELL \nYep, I'm hard. But you want to know something? I've got a weakness. You'd never guess that, would you? Well, I have. Want to know what it is? \nJOHN nods. \nCONNELL \nThe Star Spangled Banner. \n(looks directly at John) \nScrewy, huh? \n(turns back to his glass) \nWell, maybe it is. But play the \"Star Spangled Banner\"\u0097and I'm a sucker for it. It always gets me right here\u0097 \n(thumps his diaphragm) \nYou know what I mean? \nClose-up: Of JOHN. His face has become serious. \nJOHN \nYeah. \n(points to back of neck) \nIt gets me right back here. \nTwo shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL speculates about this with his head cocked. \nCONNELL \nOh, back there, huh? \nTwo shot: JOHN and CONNELL. \nCONNELL \n(emphatically) \nI'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle! \nCONNELL again makes an effort to light his bent cigarette\u0097and again is unsuccessful. \nJOHN \nYou must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs. \nCONNELL \n(sarcastically) \nYeah? \n(suddenly) \nSay, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you? \nJOHN \nSure. \nCONNELL \nSure. I don't blame you. So am I. \nClose-up: Of CONNELL. \nCONNELL \n(sincerely) \nIt's a beautiful miracle. A miracle that could only happen right here in the good old U.S.A. And I think it's terrific! What do you think of that! Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's plenty terrific! \nTwo shot: John is rather pleased to hear him say this. \nCONNELL \nAll right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh? \nJOHN \nNobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea. \nCONNELL \nIs that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does! \n(snorting) \nWait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight! \nJOHN \nYou're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff. \nCONNELL \n(cynically) \nThey can't, huh? \n(then barking) \nWho do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. His jaw stiffens, angrily. \nCONNELL'S VOICE \nAnd get a big bonus for doing them, too. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet. \nJOHN glares at him, his rage mounting. \nClose-up: Of CONNELL. Unaware of JOHN's wrath. \nCONNELL \nDon't write 'em? Why, that gold-grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen! \nJOHN \n(in an outraged outcry) \nShut up! If you weren't drunk I'd\u0097 \nSimultaneously his hand comes in and grabs the startled CONNELL violently by his shirt front, lifting him out of his seat. Camera pulls back to include JOHN\u0097who towers over CONNELL. \nWider shot: JOHN is still holding CONNELL, glaring down at him, enraged, when BEANY runs into the scene. \nBEANY \n(holding out the envelope) \nHey, Boss! Here's the speech, Boss. \nSuddenly he sees what's happening, and stares open-mouthed. \nBEANY \nHey! \nMed. shot: As JOHN pushes CONNELL back into the seat, snatches the envelope from BEANY, and exits. \nCONNELL \nGo on and read it, John, and then start socking! \nWider shot: As JOHN exits from place. BEANY suddenly realizes he has gone\u0097and chases after him. \nBEANY \nHey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe! \nCONNELL \n. . . Tubby? \nBEANY'S VOICE \nYes, sir? \nCONNELL \nBetter bring me a glass of milk. \nClose-up: Of CONNELL. He stares at his unlighted cigarette\u0097grimaces unhappily. \nCONNELL \n(mumbling) \nI'm smoking too much. \nHe grinds out the unlighted cigarette in the tray. \nDissolve to: Int. D. B.'s dining room. Close shot: Of D. B., who is at head of table, talking on phone. \nD. B. \n(into telephone) \n. . . Yes, Charlie? You've got everything all set? Fine! Has John Doe been taken care of? Good! How many people do you think will be there? \nA pleased expression comes over his face. \nD. B. \nFifteen thousand? Oh my, that's fine. Now, listen, Charlie, as soon as John Doe stops talking about me, I want you to start that demonstration. And make it a big one, you understand? \nAs D. B. hangs up. \nWider shot: Including TED SHELDON. \nTED \nDon't worry about that, D. B. My boys are there. They'll take care of it. \nD. B. \n(into telephone) \nWhat? yes, I'll be there fifteen minutes after I get your call. \nCamera draws back as he speaks. We see that dinner has been concluded. His listeners, besides TED and ANN, are half a dozen distinguished looking men, some with cigars stuck in their mouths, others sip from champagne glasses. ANN sits to D. B.'s right. \nCut to: Int. foyer: Med. shot: At D. B.'s front door. A butler is opening the door for JOHN. \nBUTLER \nIs there anything wrong? \nJOHN \n(after a pause) \nOh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine! So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? \n(turns toward D. B.) \nYou forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot\u0097you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body! \nD. B. \nNow, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used! \nJOHN \nNo you won't! You're through deciding anything! \nD. B. cannot believe his ears. \nJOHN \nAnd what's more, I'm going down to that convention and I'm gonna tell those people exactly what you and all your fine-feathered friends here are trying to cook up for them! \nHe looks up at ANN\u0097and starts tearing the speech in his hand. \nJOHN \n(strongly) \nAnd I'll say it in my own words this time. \nHe flings the torn paper toward ANN\u0097and starts out. \nHAMMETT AND OTHERS \nStop him, somebody! He'll ruin us, D. B.! \nMed. shot: At Door. As JOHN reaches it, TED steps up in front of him. \nTED \n(menacingly) \nWait a minute, young feller\u0097my uncle wants to talk to you. \nD. B. walks up to JOHN. \nD. B. \nListen to me, my son! Before you lose your head completely, may I remind you that I picked you up out of the gutter and I can throw you right back there again! You've got a nerve accusing people of things! These gentlemen and I know what's the best for the John Does of America, regardless of what tramps like you think! \nGet off that righteous horse of yours and come to your senses. You're the fake! We believe in what we're doing! You're the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver! Have you forgotten that? Well, I haven't! \nYou're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things! Do you remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it? That you were being paid to say so? You're lucky if they don't run you out of the country! \nWhy, with the newspapers and the radio stations that these gentlemen control, we can kill the John Doe movement deader than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, the moment you step out of line! Now, if you still want to go to that convention and shoot your trap off, you go ahead and do it! \nFull shot: D. B. leaves JOHN and returns to his chair. JOHN stares at him, unbelievingly. \nClose shot: of JOHN. \nJOHN \n(after a pause) \nDo you mean to tell me you'd try to kill the John Doe movement if you can't use it to get what you want? \nD. B.'S VOICE \nYou bet your bottom dollar we would! \nJOHN \n(cynically) \nWell, that certainly is a new low. I guess I've seen everything now. \nWider shot: As JOHN's lips curl up contemptuously and he steps up to the table. \nJOHN \n(throwing his hat on the table) \nYou sit there back of your big cigars and think of deliberately killing an idea that's made millions of people a little bit happier! An idea that's brought thousands of them here from all over the country, by bus and by freight, in jallopies and on foot\u0097so they could pass on to each other their own simple little experiences. \nClose-up: Of ANN. Her eyes light up happily. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nWhy, look, I'm just a mug and I know it. But I'm beginning to understand a lot of things. Why, your type's old as history. If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury it! \nClose-up: Of JOHN. His voice is pleading. \nJOHN \nWhy, this is the one worthwhile thing that's come along. People are finally finding out that the guy next door isn't a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? And yet a thing like that's got a chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in the world\u0097and you talk about killing it! \nFull shot: They listen to him\u0097unmoved. \nJOHN \nWhy, when this fire dies down, what's going to be left? More misery, more hunger and more hate. And what's to prevent that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one, and certainly not you, with those slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! The John Doe idea may be the answer, though! It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it! \nWell, you go ahead and try! You couldn't do it in a million years, with all your radio stations and all your power! Because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake! It's bigger than your ambitions! And it's bigger than all the bracelets and fur coats in the world! \nWider shot: ANN runs to JOHN. \nANN \n(sincerely) \nYou bet it is, John! \nJOHN starts to exit. \nMed. shot: Shooting toward door. \nJOHN \n(turning to them) \nAnd that's exactly what I'm going down there to tell those people! \nAs JOHN reaches door, TED SHELDON jumps in front of him. \nClose shot: \nTED \nWait a minute, you ungrateful rat! My Uncle's been too good to\u0097 \nWhile he speaks, JOHN looks down at the fist clutching his shirt, and then, with a suddenness that startles TED, he steps aside and clips TED on the jaw. TED's knees buckle and he goes down. JOHN exits. \nWider shot: As several men rush to TED's assistance. D. B. does not move. \nMAN \nHe's getting away! \nANN \nJohn! \nExt. entrance to D. B.'s house: Med. shot: As JOHN hurries out. He goes by half a dozen members of TED SHELDON's motorcycle troops who wait around to escort D. B. to the convention. \nInt. Dining room: Full shot: The room is full of commotion. ANN is running out of the room, going after JOHN. Several men bend over TED. D. B. glares toward door, his face hardening. HAMMETT is barking at him. \nD. B. reaches under the table, lifts up two phones. Hands one to HAMMETT. \nD. B. \nGet the Bulletin ! \nHe, himself, dials the other phone. \nANN \nJohn! \nBARRINGTON \nI've always told you, D. B. you're playing with dynamite! \nD. B. \n(calling to men) \nDon't let that girl get away! \nThe butler rushes out. \nWESTON \nMAN \n(reading) \n\"Federal investigation urged by Chamber of Commerce.\" \nMed. shot: Speaker's platform. SOURPUSS and BERT, reading paper. \nSOURPUSS \nHow could he be a fake? \n(laughing) \nBERT \nIt must be some kind of a gag. \nSOURPUSS \nA what? \nBERT \nA gag. A gag! \nExt. : Somewhere inside ball park: Long shot: We hear the shrieking of sirens and almost immediately a limousine, escorted by Sheldon's motorcycle troops, pulls up. Directly behind it is a string of cars. \nMed. shot: The door of the limousine flies open and D. B. comes out. He immediately heads for the platform. \nCamera pans over and we see troopers pouring out of the cars with TED SHELDON directing them. \nTED \nCome on, come on, step on it! Step on it! Step on it! You all know your places now, so let's get going! Wait for the signal! \nMed. shot: DRUNK with a balloon. He holds balloon up to TED, getting in TED's way. \nDRUNK \nHey, mister, will you autograph my balloon? \nTED \nSure! \n(and breaks balloon) \nTROOPER \n(pushing drunk aside) \nGangway! \nExt.: Park. Med. shot: At Speaker's platform. JOHN is in front of the microphone trying to make himself heard over thousands of voices, all speaking at once. \nJOHN \nLadies and gentlemen! This is exactly what I came down here to tell you about tonight. Please, if you'll all just be quiet for a few minutes I can explain this whole thing to you. As you all know, this paper is published by a man by the name of D. B. Norton . . . \nMed. shot: Shooting towards audience. Down an aisle stalks D. B., his hand waving in the air. \nD. B. \n(shouting) \nDon't listen to that man! He's a fake! \nCamera pans with him as he hurries down the aisle to the platform\u0097all eyes turned toward him. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. As he stares at D. B. approaching, too flustered to know what to do. \nMed. shot: Toward platform. As D. B. runs up the few steps and proceeds to the microphone, troopers clearing the way for him. \nTROOPER \n(drags John from mike) \nStand back! \nD. B. \nWait a minute! Everybody wait a minute! Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen! My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all know me! I accuse this man of being a faker! We've been taken for a lot of suckers! And I'm the biggest of the lot! \nI spent a fortune backing this man in what I believed to be a sincere and worthy cause, just as you all did! And now I find out it's nothing but a cheap racket! Cooked up by him and two of my employees for the sole purpose of collecting dues from John Does all over the country! \nJOHN breaks away from the troopers and gets to the mike. \nJOHN \nThat's a lie! \nD. B. \nIt's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there! \nJOHN \nThat's a lie! Listen\u0097don't believe what he says . . . \nD. B. \n(overlapping above speech) \nLet go of me! This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so! \n(turning to John) \nDo you deny that? \nJOHN \nThat's got nothing to do with it! \nD. B. \nWere you paid for it\u0097or weren't you? \nJOHN \nYes! I was paid! But the\u0097 \nD. B. \n(over-lapping above speech) \nAnd what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either! \nJOHN \nWhat difference does that make? \nD. B. \nDid you write it\u0097or didn't you? \nJOHN \nNo, I didn't write it, but\u0097 \nD. B. \nAh, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it! \nJOHN \nListen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started\u0097 \nD. B. \nThere! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people\u0097they ought to run you out of the country\u0097and I hope they do it! \nHe leaves the platform\u0097followed by his troopers. \nSeveral shots: Of groups as they stare at JOHN, silent and stunned, waiting for him to speak. \nFull shot: The whole park full of people wait in breathless anticipation. From somewhere in the distance we hear a single voice of a man. \nVOICE \nSpeak up, John! We believe you! \nMed. shot: Under the platform. We see several of D. B.'s troopers pulling at the cables of the public address system. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. He speaks into the microphone. \nJOHN \nPlease listen, folks! Now that he's through shooting off his face, I've got a couple of things to tell you about\u0097 \nClose shot: Under the platform. One of the troopers disconnects the public address system by cutting the cable. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He realizes the loud speaker is dead, and looks around helplessly. \nMed. shot: Somewhere in audience TED SHELDON directs troopers. \nListen . . . John Does . . . \n(weakly) \nYou're the hope of the world . . . \nAs if in challenge to that statement, the tomato flies in and strikes him on the forehead. It seems to stun him. He remains motionless, staring before him with sightless eyes. The red smear of the tomato trickles down his face. \nMed. shot: Of the COLONEL, amidst the crowd. He sees JOHN hit and winces. Then, setting his jaw, he pushes people violently aside, trying to reach JOHN. \nMed. shot: On platform, JOHN stares futilely before him. The COLONEL reaches his side and glancing sympathetically up at his face, starts to lead him off the platform. A squadron of policemen also rush to his rescue and precede JOHN and the COLONEL. \nTrucking shot: Down the aisle\u0097as police disperse the crowd who boo and threaten JOHN from the sidelines. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. He is oblivious of the jeering, shouting mob\u0097and of the wet newspapers flung in his direction. \nMed. shot: At dug-out exit\u0097as the police finally manage to get him safely out of the park. \nMed. shot: ANNOUNCER's booth. \nJOHN B. HUGHES \nThe police finally manage to get him out of the park! If that boy isn't hurt, it'll be a miracle! \nInt.: Police station. Med. shot: ANN and her mother sit on a bench. A policeman is in the background. ANN stares into space. Her mother has an arm around her. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE \nLadies and gentlemen, this certainly looks like the end of the John Doe movement. \nA policeman snaps the radio off. \nCONNELL \n(lifts glass of milk) \nWell, boys, you can chalk up another one to the Pontius Pilates. \nTwo shot: ANN and her mother. \nANN \n(sobbing) \nI should have been there. I could have helped him. \n(desolately) \nHe was so all alone! \nHer MOTHER draws ANN consolingly to her, and lays her head on her breast. \nDissolve to: \nExt.: A highway. Med. shot: Of BERT's car on the way home. \nInt.: Car. Close shot: BERT and SOURPUSS. They both look depressed. After a silence, SOURPUSS speaks. \nSOURPUSS \n(throatily) \nA lot of us are going to be mighty ashamed of ourselves after tonight. We certainly didn't give that man much of a chance. \nThey lapse again into silence. BERT stares grimly at the road. \nDissolve to: Ext.: Clearing under the bridge. Close-up: Of JOHN. He sits on a rock, his head bent low, tears streaming shamelessly down his cheeks. Camera draws back and we find the COLONEL before the fire, boiling water in a small tin pan. \nCOLONEL'S VOICE \nHave some more coffee, Long John? \nJOHN \nNo, thanks, Colonel. \nJOHN lifts his eyes skyward, stares profoundly, a curious expression over his face. \nDissolve to: A Montage. Long shot: Of JOHN, a lonely figure, walking dejectedly. As he walks, faces begin to appear one by one, to taunt him. Their accusing voices are heard. \nWOMAN'S VOICE \nFaker! \nMAN'S VOICE \nRacketeer! \n2ND VOICE \nLiar! \n3RD VOICE \nCheat! \n4TH VOICE \nImposter! \n5TH VOICE \nWhy don't you jump! \nGIRL'S VOICE \nChristmas Eve at midnight! \n(she laughs, sneeringly) \nDissolve to: Another shot: Of JOHN walking, his expression immobile. Over the shot appear several scenes through which JOHN has lived: \n1. BERT shaking hands with him, saying: \nBERT \nYou're a wonderful man, Mr. Doe. \n2. MRS. DELANEY kissing his hand and saying: \nMRS. DELANEY \nMay God bless you, my boy. \n3. ANN in Broadcasting Station, kissing him: \nANN \nNow, get in there and pitch! \n4. D. B. issuing his tirade at JOHN: \nD. B. \nYou're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things. You remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it\u0097that you were being paid to say so? \n5. Again the girl who laughed appears: \nGIRL \nChristmas Eve at midnight? \nAnd again she laughs sneeringly. \nDissolve to: Ext.: City Hall tower\u0097night. Long shot: It is a picturesque scene of the City Hall outlined in silhouette against the sky. A peaceful mantle of snow silently descends upon it. Over the shot we hear the plaintive voices of children singing \"Holy Night.\" \nDissolve to: Ext.: Outside of D. B.'s house: Med. shot: Outside D. B.'s Study\u0097through window. A group of eight young carolers sing \"Holy Night.\" It is a continuation of the music from previous scene. \nCut to: Int. D. B.'s study. Med. shot: In the dimly lit room, we see the lonely figure of D. B., as he stands near a window staring out, meditatively. The voices of the children singing Christmas carols are faintly heard. \nClose-up: Of D. B. He peers into the night, enveloped by disturbing thoughts. After a moment, he takes out his watch and glances at it. Then, as if annoyed by his own apprehension, he shoves it violently back into his pocket. \nCamera retreats in front of him as he crosses, determinedly, to a humidor, takes a cigar and shoves it into his mouth. Just as he is about to light it, he becomes aware of the signing, and cocks his head, listening. \nWider shot: As he drops the match and the unlighted cigar\u0097and starts toward door. Just then the BUTLER comes through. \nBUTLER \nMerry Christmas, sir. \nD. B. \nOh. Merry Christmas. \nD. B. hands him a bill and nods toward the children. The BUTLER exits. \nClose-up: Of D. B. Staring out into space moodily. We hear the voices of the children saying, \"Thank you, sir! Merry Christmas!\" D. B.'s mouth screws up, unhappily. It is far from a \"merry\" Christmas. It is a very lonely, conscience-stricken one. \nDissolve to: Int.: Police station. Med. shot: A SERGEANT sits in front of his desk. Opposite him is a POLICEMAN. Their rummy game has been interrupted by a phone call which the SERGEANT is now answering. \nSERGEANT \nWho? John Doe? Is that screwball still around? \n(laughing) \nThis is as far as the elevator goes. We've got to walk up to the tower. \nHe indicates the stairway. \nCut to: Wider shot: As they cross to stairway, silently. \nDissolve to: Ext.: City Hall roof. Full shot: The men enter. They glance around searchingly\u0097and then slowly move toward the edge of the parapet. \nCloser shot: The men look obviously self-conscious. No one speaks for a while. \nBENNETT \n(breaking the silence) \nThat tramp is probably full of Christmas cheer and asleep in some flop house. \nThere is again silence. After a few minutes, the MAYOR speaks. \nMAYOR \nLet's go. I've got to decorate my tree. \nCut to: Int.: Corridor\u009714th floor. Med. shot: Outside Men's Washroom. JOHN comes out, and as camera pans with him he proceeds to letter chute next to elevator. We see that it is the top of the chute, and from the elevator being there, we know it is the 14th floor. JOHN drops the letter into the chute. \nExt.: City Hall roof. Full shot: The place is silent except for occasional scraping of feet as several of the men move around. They continually refer to their watches. Finally, D. B. gives up impatiently. \nD. B. \nWell, I give up. I don't know what gave us the idea that he\u0097he'd attempt anything like this. \nWESTON \nI guess you're right. I'm afraid the joke's on us. Let's go. \nD. B. \nI hope nobody finds out we've been here. \nThey all start to exit, when suddenly D. B. stops. He puts his hand out, and they all stop to listen. They hear footsteps, and back into the shadows. \nMed. shot: Shooting toward stairs. JOHN appears around the bend and mounts the last few steps. \nMed. shot: Of the huddled group. They watch breathlessly. In the darkness, their eyes dominate the scene. \nMed. shot: Over their shoulders. As JOHN, expressionless, his cigarette in his hand, crosses to the parapet, and looks out. He takes a puff of his cigarette and exhales the smoke. \nMed. shot: Of the huddled group. The MAYOR is for stepping forward, but D. B. with an extended hand stops him, indicating for them to wait and see what happens. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He takes the envelope out of his pocket and examines it. \nClose shot: Of the group. Their eyes glued on him tensely. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. He stares at the envelope. \nInsert: Of envelope. On it is written: \"TO JOHN DOES EVERYWHERE\". \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He replaces the envelope in his pocket. \nInt.: Tower. Close shot: The group. Their eyes riveted on JOHN. They feel the moment has come. Several of them glance toward D. B. \nWider shot: To include them all, and JOHN. He drops his cigarette on the ground, and bending over, crushes it with his foot. Just as he straightens out again, D. B. speaks. \nD. B. \n(restrained voice) \nI wouldn't do that if I were you, John. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. As he turns sharply, startled. He stares blankly at the five people. \nMed. shot: Of the group. They move slightly forward and stop. \nD. B. \nIt'll do you no good. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He continues to stare at them, strangely. \nWider shot: To include them all. \nD. B. \nThe Mayor has policemen downstairs with instructions to remove all marks of identification you may have on your person. You'll be buried in Potter's Field[12] and you will have accomplished nothing. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. After a moment, he speaks. \nJOHN \n(in a sepulchral voice) \nI've taken care of that. I've already mailed a copy of this letter to Mr. Connell. \nMed. shot: Of the group. Amazed that he thought of this. They feel themselves helpless. D. B. tries taking an authoritative tone. \nD. B. \n(his throat is dry) \nJohn, why don't you forget this foolishness? \nHe steps forward as he speaks. \nJOHN \n(quickly\u0097threateningly) \nStop right where you are, Mr. Norton, if you don't want to go overboard with me. \nClose-up: Of JOHN's face. His eyes have a wild, maniacal look in them. \nClose-up: Of D. B. He stares into JOHN's eyes and a terrified expression covers his face. \nWider shot: As D. B. instinctively backs up. \nJOHN \n(throatily) \nI'm glad you gentlemen are here. You've killed the John Doe movement, all right, but you're going to see it born all over again. Now, take a good look, Mr. Norton. \nInt.: Landing to tower. Med. shot: As ANN practically has to pull herself up to the last step. Her face is wet from fever and exhaustion. \nANN \n(an outcry) \nJohn! \nInt.: Tower. Full shot: As everyone, startled by the outcry, turns. ANN staggers into scene. \nANN \n(crying) \nJohn! \nShe rushes and throws her arms around him. \nANN \n(muffled sobs) \nOh, John, darling. No! No! \nClose shot: JOHN and ANN. He stares down at her, blankly. ANN clutches him, her head buried in his shoulder. \nANN \n(muffled sobs) \nI won't let you. I love you, darling. \nMed. shot: Of the group. They remain motionless, watching. \nClose shot: JOHN and ANN. She emits wracking sobs, then lifts her eyes up to him. \nANN \n(in a desperate plea) \nJohn. Please, John, listen to me. We'll start all over again, just you and I. It isn't too late. The John Doe movement isn't dead yet. \nSuddenly she becomes conscious of the others present, and she turns her head. \nCamera pans over to what she sees. The group of men watching, silently. \nCamera pans back to ANN. Her eyes widen slowly. She looks from them to JOHN and back again, and her face takes on an excited, breathless look, as the reason for their being there becomes comprehensible to her. \nANN \n(excitedly) \nSee, John! It isn't dead, or they wouldn't be here! It's alive in them . They kept it alive. By being afraid of it. That's why they came up here. \nClose shot: ANN and JOHN. He continues to stand with his hands at his sides, looking at her, while she clings to him desperately. While she speaks, he turns his face from her and stares at the men. \n", "test1_input": "SECRETARY \nWhat? \nMAYOR \nOut the window! Something just flew by! \nSECRETARY \nI didn't see anything. \nMAYOR \n(semi-hysterical) \nWell, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building? \nThe SECRETARY, telephone in hand, peers out window. \nMAYOR \nIs there a crowd in the street? \nSECRETARY \nNo, sir. \nMAYOR \nThen he may be caught on a ledge!

Connell! This is\u0097 \n(to Secretary) \nWhat are you doing? \n(back to phone) \nThis is the Mayor. \nInt. CONNELL's office: Full shot: CONNELL is on the phone. POP DWYER is draped in a chair nearby. \nCONNELL \nYes, Mayor Lovett! How many times are you gonna call me? I've got everybody and his brother and sister out looking for him. Did you see the box I'm running? \nHe picks up the front page of the Bulletin; we see a four column box on the front page. \nCONNELL \n(reading) \n\"An appeal to John Doe. 'Think it over, John. Life can be beautiful,' says Mayor. 'If you need a job, apply to the editor of this paper . . .'\" \" and so forth and so forth . . . Okay, Mayor. I'll let you know as soon as I have something! What? . . . Well, pull down the blinds! \n(he hangs up) \nThe door opens and a man enters. His name is BEANY. Walks fast, talks fast and accomplishes nothing. Outside, we see the painter trying once more to get his sign painted. He reaches in\u0097and pulls the door to. \nBEANY \nI went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way. \nCONNELL \nWhere is she? \nBEANY \nHey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that? \nCONNELL \n(controlling his patience) \nDid you find her? \nBEANY \nNo. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean! \nCONNELL \n(barking) \nGo out and find her! \nBEANY \nSure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . . \nCONNELL picks up telephone. \nCONNELL \nHello! . . . Yeh? \nBEANY \nHer old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her. \nBEANY exits, knocking over an ash-stand. \nCONNELL \n(into phone) \nHoly smokes, Commissioner. You've had twenty-four hours! Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil. Here it is again. She's about five foot five, brown eyes, light chestnut hair and as fine a pair of legs as . \nThe door opens, ANN stands there\u0097CONNELL sees her. \nCONNELL \n(into phone\u0097staring at Ann) \n. . . ever walked into this office. \nMed. shot: At door. The sign painter is slowly beginning to lose patience. He again reaches in\u0097pulls the door shut\u0097glaring at ANN. \nClose-up: Of ANN. \nANN \n(innocently) \nDid you want to see me? \nWider shot: CONNELL, without moving, stares at her. \nCONNELL \n(quietly\u0097sizzling) \nNo. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day. \nANN \nI remember, distinctly, being fired. \n", "test1_true": "That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it! \nANN \nWhat's that? \nCONNELL \nThe letter. \nANN \nWhat letter? \nCONNELL \nThe letter from John Doe. \nANN \nOh! \nCONNELL \nThe whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue. \nANN \n(simply) \nThere is no letter. \nCONNELL \nWe'll get a handwriting expert to\u0097 \n(suddenly realizes what she has said) \nWhat! \nANN \nThere is no letter. \nHe stares at her for a moment, flabbergasted\u0097exchanges a look with POP\u0097crosses to the back door\u0097shuts it\u0097then comes back to face her. \nClose shot: ANN and CONNELL. \nCONNELL \nSay that again. \nANN \nThere is no letter. I made it up. \nCONNELL looks at her a long moment and then up at POP. \nCONNELL \n(repeating dully) \nYou made it up. \nANN \nUh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks. \nWider shot: As he recovers from the shock, and then wheels on ANN again. \nCONNELL \nDon't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy? Twenty-two families want to board him free? Five women want to marry him, and the Mayor's practically ready to adopt him? And you . . . \nAs CONNELL glares at her the door springs open and BEANY enters. \nBEANY \nI just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there\u0097 \nCONNELL \nShut up! \nClose-up: Of BEANY. He is startled by this\u0097and then stares popeyed as he sees ANN. \nBEANY \nAnn! Say, why didn't yuh\u0097 \nCONNELL \nBeany! \nMed. shot: At the door. The painter is beginning to grind his teeth. He pulls the door shut, viciously. \nWider shot: To include all. \nPOP \nOnly one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly. \nCONNELL \nHow? \nPOP \nRun a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and\u0097 \nCONNELL \n(jumps in quickly) \nThat's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. \"Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life.\" Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up. \n(into dictograph) \nOh, Ned! \nNED'S VOICE \nYeah? \nCONNELL \nI got a story I want yuh to\u0097 \nANN \nWait a minute! \nShe rushes over\u0097snaps the dictograph off. \nMed. shot: Of ANN, leaning on CONNELL's desk. \nANN \nListen, you great big wonderful genius of a newspaperman! You came down here to shoot some life into this dying paper, didn't you? \nCONNELL blinks under the attack. POP and BEANY move into the scene. \nANN \nWell, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market! \nCONNELL \n(thoroughly bewildered) \nIn what man! \nANN \nJohn Doe. \nCONNELL \nWhat John Doe? \nANN \nOur John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius\u0097 Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe\u0097and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him! \nCONNELL \nA deal? \nANN \nSure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world. \nTwo shot: ANN and CONNELL. Despite himself, he's interested in her recital. \nANN \n", "test2_input": "All right. I need one more. \nANN \nGo right ahead. \nWhile there is this confusion, the COLONEL pushes in and stands in the doorway. \nCOLONEL \nHow're you doin'? \nCONNELL \n(calls to Beany outside) \nAll right, Beany\u0097bring 'em in! \nWhile CONNELL speaks, two MIDGETS push the COLONEL out of the way and enter the room. The COLONEL glances down\u0097and nearly jumps out of his skin. BEANY follows them in. \nCOLONEL \nHoly smoke! A half a heelot! \nBEANY \nThere you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people. \nCONNELL \nOkay. Get them up. \nBEANY lifts them and places them, one on each of JOHN's arms. The flashlights go off. \nANN \nThis is ridiculous, Mr. Connell! Come on, give him a chance. The man's on the air! \nWhile she speaks, she tries to shove the photographers out. \nBOY MIDGET \n(to girl midget) \nCome on, Snooks\u0097you better bail out. \nGIRL MIDGET \n(coquettishly) \nGoodbye, Mr. Doe! \nBEANY lifts her off\u0097and ANN pushes them all out\u0097just as the STAGE MANAGER reappears. \nSTAGE MANAGER \nBetter get ready. One minute to go! \nTwo shot: JOHN and ANN. ANN turns quickly to JOHN. \nANN \nWow! One minute to go, and the score is nothing to nothing! Now, please, John, you won't let me down, will you? Will you? 'Course you won't. If you'll just think of yourself as the real John Doe. \nListen. Everything in that speech are things a certain man believed in. He was my father, John. And when he talked, people listened. They'll listen to you, too. \nFunny\u0097you know what my mother said the other night? She said to look into your eyes\u0097that I'd see Father there. \nSTAGE MANAGER \nHey\u0097what do you say? \nANN \nOkay! We're coming. Come on! \nANN \nNow, listen, John. You're a pitcher. Now, get in there and pitch! \n(kisses his cheek) \nGood luck. \nFor a moment he just stares at her, under a spell. Then, turning, he exits. After a second of watching him, ANN follows. \nSTUDIO OFFICIAL \nGive him room, let him through. Come on. \nInt. broadcasting stage: Med. shot: Camera retreats in front of JOHN and the official, as they leave the office and proceed to the microphones. Everyone stares curiously at JOHN\u0097whispering to each other. \nMed. shot: Shooting through glass partition, toward control booth. We see the two men at the board. They glance nervously at their watches\u0097then at the clock on the wall. \nClose shot: Of ANN. She has taken a position at a table near the mike. Next to her sits CONNELL. ANN watches JOHN with intense interest. \nThe COLONEL has followed JOHN up to the microphone. \nCOLONEL \n(to John) \nHey. Let's get out o' here. There's the door right there. \nM.C. \nHey, what're you doing here? \nCOLONEL \nThat's what I'd like to know! \nM.C. \nCome on, out. Out. \nJOHN \nSay, he's a friend of mine. \nANN \n(at John's elbow) \nNever mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you. \nJOHN starts to follow ANN away from mike. ANN leads him back to mike again. \nANN \nNo, John\u0097over here. \n2ND M.C. \nStand by. \nMed. shot: At door. The COLONEL surreptitiously tries the door, to see that it opens readily. Standing near him is BEANY and the others. \nMed. shot: Group around SPENCER. They wait expectantly. Their eyes sparkling with excitement. \nSPENCER \nPhone the Chronicle . Tell 'em to start getting those extras out. \nMed. shot: Toward control booth. The man with the earphones on has his hand up ready to give the signal. He listens a moment, then abruptly drops his hand. \nClose-up: The man near the announcer throws his hand up as a signal to someone off scene. \nMed. shot: An orchestra in a corner. The conductor waves his baton\u0097and the orchestra blasts out a dramatic fanfare. \nClose shot: ANNOUNCER and JOHN. ANNOUNCER holds his script up and the moment the music stops he speaks dramatically. \nANNOUNCER \n(rapid-fire) \nAnd good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the New Bulletin . Tonight we give you something entirely new and different. Standing beside me is the young man who has declared publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends to commit suicide, giving as his reason\u0097quote: \"I protest against the state of civilization.\" End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the New Bulletin takes pleasure in presenting the man who is fast becoming the most talked-of person in the whole country, JOHN DOE! \nThe man next to him waves his hand\u0097there is an outburst of music. \nA flash: Of ANN\u0097she looks at JOHN intently. \nMed. shot: Group around BEANY. They all applaud, except for MIKE and the COLONEL. MIKE, with his hand hanging down, nudges the COLONEL. \nClose shot: Of their hands meeting and we see the envelope change hands. Camera pans up to the COLONEL's face which is twisted into a miserable grimace. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He glances around, uncertainly. \nClose shot: Of MIKE and the COLONEL. MIKE elbows the COLONEL to throw his signal. The COLONEL looks toward JOHN and nods his head. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. He catches the COLONEL'S signal and quickly his hand goes to his pocket. Just as he is about to bring it out, his hand pauses. He turns and looks at ANN. \nClose-up: Of ANN. A warm, pleading look in her eyes. \nMed. shot: Around JOHN. He is still staring at ANN, when the ANNOUNCER reaches over and nudges him\u0097pointing to the mike. JOHN snaps out of it\u0097turns his face to the mike\u0097pushes the paper back in his pocket\u0097and starts reading ANN'S speech. \n", "test2_true": "(reading speech) \nLadies and gentlemen: I am the man you all know as John Doe. \n(clearing his throat) \nI took that name because it seems to describe\u0097because it seems to describe \n(his voice unnatural) \nthe average man, and that's me. \n(repeats, embarrassedly) \nAnd that's me. \nMed. shot: The COLONEL and MIKE. The COLONEL realizes JOHN is not going to make SPENCER'S speech, and his face breaks into a broad grin. He takes MIKE'S hand and slaps the envelope into his palm. Over the shot we hear JOHN'S voice. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nWell, it was me\u0097before I said I was gonna jump off the City Hall roof at midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I guess I'm not average any more. Now, I'm getting all sorts of attention, from big shots, too. \nMed. shot: To include JOHN and ANN. \nMed. shot: Around SPENCER, as MIKE enters to him and hands him envelope. \nMIKE \n(whispering) \nWe've been double-crossed! \nSPENCER stares at the envelope, frothing at the mouth. \nSPENCER \nWe have!? \nMed. shot: Featuring JOHN and ANN. \nJOHN \nThe Mayor and the Governor, for instance. They don't like those articles I've been writing. \nSuddenly they are startled by SPENCER's voice. \nSPENCER'S VOICE \nYou're an imposter, young fella! That's a pack of lies you're telling! \nQuick flashes: Of reaction from audience, CONNELL and others. \nSPENCER \nWho wrote that speech for you? \n(pointing accusing finger at JOHN) \nCONNELL \nBeany, get that guy! \nMed. shot: Around SPENCER. It is as far as he gets. Several attendants, BEANY among them, have reached him and start throwing him out. \nCut to: Int. D. B. NORTON's study: Med. shot: D. B. and TED SHELDON are listening to JOHN's speech over the radio. D. B. is astonished at the disturbance in the program. \nD. B. \n(recognizing the voice) \nThat's Spencer! \nCut to: Int. broadcasting stage: \nClose shot: Of ANNOUNCER. \nM.C. \nLadies and gentlemen, the disturbance you just heard was caused by someone in the audience who tried to heckle Mr. Doe. The speech will continue. \nMed. shot: Featuring JOHN and ANN. \nJOHN \nWell, people like the Governor \n(laughing\u0097ad libs) \nPeople like the Governor and that fella there can\u0097can stop worrying. I'm not gonna talk about them. \nANN smiles admiringly. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He is becoming strangely absorbed in what he is saying. \nJOHN \nI'm gonna talk about us, the average guys, the John Does. If anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like, you couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things. He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and he's wise. He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of larceny in his heart. He seldom walks up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left a nickel there. \nClose-up: Of ANN. Her eyes are glued on JOHN. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nHe's the man the ads are written for. He's the fella everybody sells things to. He's Joe Doakes,[8] the world's greatest stooge and the world's greatest strength. \n(clearing throat) \nYes, sir. Yessir, we're a great family, the John Does. We're the meek who are, er, supposed to inherit the earth. You'll find us everywhere. We raise the crops, we dig the mines, work the factories, keep the books, fly the planes and drive the busses! And when a cop yells: \"Stand back there, you!\" He means us, the John Does! \nCut to: Int. D. B. 's study: \nMed. shot: D. B. and TED listen near the radio. TED's eyes flash angrily. \nTED \nWell, what kind of a speech is that? Didn't you read it? \nD. B. stops him with a gesture of his hand. He doesn't want to miss a word. \nCut to: Int. broadcasting stage: \nMed. shot: Toward JOHN. \nJOHN \nWe've existed since time began. We built the pyramids, we saw Christ crucified, pulled the oars for Roman emperors, sailed the boats for Columbus, retreated from Moscow with Napoleon and froze with Washington at Valley Forge! \n(gasping) \nYes, sir. We've been in there dodging left hooks since before history began to walk! In our struggle for freedom we've hit the canvas many a time, but we always bounced back! \nMed. shot\u0097panning: Around audience\u0097to get a variety of interested faces. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nBecause we're the people \u0097and we're tough! \nClose-up: Of JOHN. \nJOHN \nThey've started a lot of talk about free people going soft\u0097that we can't take it. That's a lot of hooey! . . . A free people can beat the world at anything, from war to tiddle-de-winks, if we all pull in the same direction! \nMed. shot: To include radio announcer and other radio officials. Their interest centers on JOHN. \nJOHN \nI know a lot of you are saying \"What can I do? I'm just a little punk. I don't count.\" Well, you're dead wrong! The little punks have always counted because in the long run the character of a country is the sum total of the character of its little punks. \nInt. D. B.'s study. Med. Shot. D. B.'s expression of disturbance has vanished. It is now replaced by one of thoughtfulness and interest. He looks off toward the foyer, and impulsively goes in that direction. \nCut to: \nInt. foyer. \nMed. shot: D. B. crosses to a pantry door and pushes the swinging door open slightly. \nInt. pantry: Med. shot: All we can see through the slightly open door is one side of the room. Clustered around the radio on a table are all the household help. They listen, fascinated. \nInt. foyer: Closeup of D. B. His eyes begin to brighten with an idea. Meantime, over the foregoing shots, JOHN's voice has continued. \nJOHN'S VOICE \nBut we've all got to get in there and pitch! We can't win the old ball game unless we have team work. And that's where every John Doe comes in! It's up to him to get together with his teammate! \nCut to: Int. broadcasting station: \nMed. shot: Closeup: Of JOHN. \nJOHN \nAnd your teammates, my friends, is the guy next door to you. Your neighbor! He's a terribly important guy, that guy next door! You're gonna need him and he's gonna need you . . . so look him up! If he's sick, call on him! If he's hungry, feed him! If he's out of a job, find him one! To most of you, your neighbor is a stranger, a guy with a barking dog, and a high fence around him. \nMed. shot: Somewhere in audience. \nJOHN'S VOICE \n", "test3_input": "Med. shot: Around BERT. He looks over at JOHN, hesitates a moment, and then speaks. \nBERT \nWell, er, the reason we wanted to tell you this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an idea what you started. And from where I'm sitting, I don't see any sense in your jumping off any building. \nGROUP \nNo! \nSOURPUSS \nNo! \nBERT \nWell, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. Deeply touched. Shifts awkwardly, unable to say anything. \nMed. shot: As D. B. and ANN watch his face to see the effect. \nGROUP \nWell, goodbye. \nSOURPUSS \nGoodbye Mr. Doe. \nBERT has turned to go, and the rest follow suit. They all shuffle silently out. \nMed. shot: Of an old couple who remain looking up at JOHN, as those around them leave. The old lady takes the old man's arm and starts toward JOHN. Camera pans with them until they reach him. \nOLD LADY \nI'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and God bless you, my boy. \n(she gently kisses his hand) \nThe two OLD PEOPLE leave. \nClose-up: Of JOHN. He swallows a lump in his throat. He watches the old people until they have left, then with a quick glance at his hand\u0097and self-consciously in front of the others, stuffs his hand into his pocket. \nFull shot: As they all watch him, without speaking. JOHN runs his hand through his hair, stealing a fleeting glance at the others, and grins awkwardly. \nClose shot: Of D. B. as he signals to the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who have remained, to leave. \nMed. shot: Of the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who receive the signal and discreetly exit. \nFull shot: They wait for JOHN to speak, but JOHN begins walking around, profoundly thoughtful. \nClose-up: Of the COLONEL watching him, concerned. \nTwo shot: Of D. B. and ANN. Their eyes glued on him, expectantly. \nFull shot: JOHN still paces, disturbed by clashing emotions. He stops, glances at the door, a soft, thoughtful expression in his eyes. Then, as his thought shifts, he runs his left hand over his pitching arm. \nJOHN \nGee, whiz\u0097I'm all mixed up\u0097I don't get it. Look, all those swell people think I'm gonna jump off a building or something. \nHe looks toward the door. \nJOHN \nI never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella'd have to be a mighty fine example himself to go around telling other people how to\u0097Say, look, what happened the other night was on account of Miss Mitchell, here. She wrote the stuff. \nANN walks over to JOHN. \nTwo shot: ANN and JOHN. She faces him, looking up into his face. \nANN \nDon't you see what a wonderful thing this can be? \n(softly) \nBut we need you , John. \nClose-up: Of the COLONEL. He stares at JOHN, sees him weakening, and grimaces disgustedly. \nWider shot: The COLONEL watches JOHN as he continues to turn it over in his mind. \nCOLONEL \n(suddenly) \nYou're hooked! I can see that right now. \nThey all look up, startled. \nCOLONEL \nThey got you. Well, I'm through. \n(crosses to door\u0097stops, turns) \nFor three years I've been trying to get you up to the Columbia River country. First, it was your glass arm. Then it was the radio. And now it's the John Doe clubs. Well, I ain't waiting another minute. \nHe opens the door and when he sees the townspeople still gathered outside, he yells to them. \nCOLONEL \nGangway, you heelots! \nHe pushes his way out. \nJOHN \n(calling) \nHey, Colonel! Wait a minute! \nHe starts after the COLONEL, but when he gets to the door, the townspeople surge toward him and block his way. \nJOHN \nHey, Colonel! \nCROWD \nOh, please, Mr. Doe\u0097 \nClose-up: Of JOHN. \nJOHN \n(calling futilely) \nHey, Colonel! \nHe tries to peer over the heads of the townspeople who go on chattering. There is a trapped look on JOHN's face. \nTwo shot: D. B. and ANN. They exchange victorious glances: \nDissolve to: Int. office of headquarters. Close shot: Of large map of the U.S. over the top of which we read: \"John Doe Clubs.\" There are a dozen pegs scattered over the map, indicating where the clubs are. We hear D. B.'s voice. \nCamera draws back and we find D. B. talking to a group of men in front of him. \nD. B. \nI want you personally to go along with John Doe and Miss Mitchell and handle the press and the radio. \nCHARLIE \n(an experienced promoter) \nMe? \nD. B. \nYes. I don't want to take any chances. And Johnson? \nJOHNSON \nYes. D. B. \nD. B. \nYour crew will do the mop up job. They'll follow John Doe into every town, see that the clubs are properly organized and the charters issued. \nCHARLIE \nRight. \nD. B. \nThere are only eight flags up there now. I want to see that map covered before we get through! \nMed. shot: D. B. is still speaking as camera moves down to the map again, which constantly remains a background for the montage following. As the montage proceeds, pegs begin to appear in abundance on the map. \nA montage: Accompanied by a fanfare of music. \n1.

We recognize the MAYOR, and the President of the Chamber of Commerce. Representatives of several other branches of the City Administration are also present. CONNELL sits near D. B.\u0097scrutinizing him thoughtfully. On the other side of D. B. is TED SHELDON. \nD. B. \nI tell you, ladies and gentlemen, this thing has been nothing short of a prairie fire. We've received so many applications for charters to the John Doe Clubs we haven't been able to take care of them. \nMAYOR LOVETT \nI'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me! \nGroup laughs. \nD. B. \nThis John Doe convention is a natural. It's gonna put our city on the map. Why, over twentyfour hundred John Doe clubs are sending delegates. Can you imagine that? You, Mr. Mayor, will be the official host. You will make the arrangements for decorating the city, parades and a reception for John Doe when he gets home! And\u0097don't wear your high hat! \nMAYOR LOVETT \n(disappointed) \nNo high hat? \nD. B. \nNo high hat. And from you, Connell, I want a special John Doe edition every day until the convention is over. \n(dismissing them) \nAnd now, if you will please just step into the outer office and look your prettiest because there are photographers there to take pictures of this committee. \nThey start to exit.

This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty. \nD. B. \n(annoyed) \nWell? \nCONNELL \nWell, I'm stuck with two and two\u0097but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it. \n(cocking his head) \nWhere do you come in? \nD. B. \nWhy\u0097uh\u0097 \n(suddenly smiles) \nWhy, I'll have the satisfaction of knowing that my money has been spent for a worthy cause. \nClose-up: of CONNELL. He stares at D. B. a moment.

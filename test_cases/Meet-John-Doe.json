Wait till we get home. \nWIFE \nDon't you push me around like that! Even though I'm your wife, you can't push me around\u0097 \nMAYOR \nOhhhh! \nThey all shuffle out, and D.B. shuts the door. JOHN watches him, doesn't like his proprietary manner. \nJOHN \nLook, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here. \nD. B. \nThere's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. \n(laughing) \nIt's only natural that people\u0097 \nJOHN \nWell, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby. \nANN \n(gets in front of him\u0097pleads) \nLook, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going\u0097 \nJOHN \n(interested despite himself) \nJohn Doe Clubs? What for? \nANN \nUh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech. \nJOHN \n(regains his former attitude) \nI don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either. \nANN \nOh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you. \nJOHN \nLook, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it? \nANN \nUh-huh . . . \nJOHN \nWell, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone? \nANN \nOh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour. \nJOHN \nMe? \nANN \nUh-huh. \nD. B. \nWhy, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement. \nJOHN \nSay, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here. \nANN \nJohn! \nThe beaming COLONEL starts to follow him to the door. When they get there, the door suddenly flies open and a crowd of townspeople push their way in\u0097with the MAYOR and the SHERIFF trying to hold them back. \nMAYOR \nPlease, please! I just got rid of one crowd. \nWOMAN \nOh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him the John Doe Club wants to talk to him. \nClose-up: Of D. B. He gets an idea. These people might influence JOHN. \nD. B. \nLet them in, Mr. Mayor. Let them come in. \nFull shot: As the MAYOR and the SHERIFF back away. \nMAYOR \nOkay, folks, but remember your manners. No stampeding. Walk slow, like you do when you come to pay your taxes. \nMed. shot: Of the group. They shuffle forward grinning happily. Those in the rear rise on tiptoes for a better look. The men doff their hats as they come forward. \nMed. shot: Of JOHN, the COLONEL, ANN and D.B. John glances around nervously. The COLONEL is worried. \nMed. shot: Of the townspeople. They just stand there, awkwardly, some grinning sheepishly, others staring at JOHN. Finally someone nudges a young man in the foreground and whispers. \nSOMEONE \nCome on, Bert. \nBERT \nOkay. All right, give me a chance. \nWOMAN \n(making room for him) \nCome right in. \nWider shot: As the group around JOHN wait expectantly. \nBERT \n(clearing throat) \nMy name's Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe, I'm the head soda jerker at Schwabacher's Drug Store. \nClose shot: Of BERT\u0097as he plunges into his story. \nBERT \nWell, sir, you see, me and my wife, we heard your broadcast, and we got quite a bang out of it, especially my wife. \nWider shot: To include JOHN and the others. \nBERT \nKept me up half the night saying \"That man's right, honey. The trouble with the world is\u0097nobody gives a hoot about his neighbor. That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other.\" \nAnd I kept saying, \"Well, that's fine, but how's a guy gonna go around loving the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss for instance!\" \n(laughing) \n", "test1_true": "(laughing) \nClose-up: Of BERT. \nBERT \nWell, anyway, the next morning I'm out watering the lawn and I look over and there's Sourpuss on the other side of the hedge straightening out a dent in his fender and, er, my wife yells to me out of the window. She says, \"Go on. Speak to him, Bert.\" And I figured, well, heck, I can't lose anything\u0097so I yelled over to him \"Good morning, Mr. Smithers.\" He went right on pounding his fender, and was I burned! So I turned around to give my wife a dirty look and she said, \"Louder, louder. He didn't hear you.\" So, in a voice you could of heard in the next county, I yelled. \"Good morning, Mr. Smithers!\" \nMed. shot: Featuring JOHN and BERT. JOHN is very interested. \nBERT \nWell, sir, you coulda knocked me over with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned around surprised like, and he put on a big smile, came over and took my hand like an old lodge brother, and he said. \"Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting to talk to you for years, only I thought you didn't like me.\" And then he started chatting away like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin' up. \nMed. shot: Of a group of neighbors. They smile sympathetically. \nBERT'S VOICE \nWell, Mr. Doe, before we got through, I found out Smithers is a swell egg, only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts for all the noises. \nWider shot: To include BERT, JOHN and others. \nBERT \nAnd he says it's a shame how little we know about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, \"How's about inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know each other a little better?\" Well, I'm feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe for anything. \nClose shot: Of ANN and D. B. They listen, amused and excited. \nBERT \nSo Smithers goes around the neighborhood inviting everybody to a meeting at the school house and I tell everybody that comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, my boss. \n(laughing) \nOh, I'm talking too much. \nMed. shot: JOHN and BERT. \nBERT \nWell, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another. \nBERT'S WIFE \nTell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey. \nBERT \nOh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey. \nHis WIFE comes forward and stands beside him. \nBERT \nThis is my wife, Mr. Doe. \nMRS. HANSEN nods her head shyly\u0097and JOHN acknowledges the introduction by a half wave of his hand. \nWIFE \nHow do you do, Mr. Doe . . . Er, Sourpuss is here, too. \nBERT \n(turns around) \nOh, is he? \nWIFE \n(pointing) \nUh-huh. \nMed. shot: Of a group around SOURPUSS. He is as described, except when he smiles, his whole face warms up. Those around him push him forward. At first he looks bewildered, then, understanding, he starts toward BERT, grinning sheepishly. \nMed. shot: Around BERT\u0097as SOURPUSS comes forward. \nBERT \nThis is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe. \nSOURPUSS \nTh\u0097that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural. \n(laughing) \nThere are snickers from the background. \nBERT \nWell, anyway, I\u0097I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, \"Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong.\" And then he tells \nus about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. \"If you ask me,\" he says, \"they're starving.\" \nSOURPUSS \nOld man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it. \nClose shot: Of JOHN. Profoundly impressed by this. \nWider shot: BERT clears his throat. \nBERT \nYeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen of us ran over there to fetch them and we got them to the meeting. What a reception they got. Why, everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss over them, and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney just sat right down and cried. \nHe smiles, embarrassed, and JOHN, as well as the others, clear their throats. \nSOURPUSS \nAnd then we started to find out about a lot of other people. \nBERT \nYeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance. \nBERT'S WIFE \nGrubbel's here. See? \n(pointing) \nBERT \nYeah. That's\u0097that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. \"Why, Grubbel,\" he says, \"he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect,\" he says. \nBERT'S WIFE \nJust like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe. \nSOURPUSS \nWell, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief! \nBERT \nYeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney\u0097 \nWIFE \nAnd he gave you that five dollar raise. \nBERT \nYeah! Wasn't that swell! \n(laughing) \nMed. shot: Around MAYOR HAWKINS. He steps forward. \nMAYOR \nWhy, Bert, I feel slighted. I'd like to join but nobody asked me. \nMed. shot: Around BERT and SOURPUSS. \nSOURPUSS \nWell, I'm sorry, Mayor, but we voted that no politicians could join. \nBERT'S WIFE \nJust the John Does of the neighborhood. Cause you know how politicians are. \n(becomes embarrassed) \nClose-up: Of the MAYOR\u0097completely deflated. \nSOURPUSS \nYeah . . . \nMed. shot: Around JOHN. As they smile, amused at the MAYOR'S discomfiture. \n", "test1_id": 2415, "test2_input": "ANN is deeply concerned. She watches him, helplessly. \nJOHN \n(continuing) \nYou know, I never thought much about people before. They were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers. The only time I worried about them was if they\u0097is when they didn't come in to see me pitch. You know, lately I've been watching them while I talked to them. I could see something in their faces. I could feel that they were hungry for something. Do you know what I mean? \nANN nods. \nJOHN \nMaybe that's why they came. Maybe they were just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life. \nANN forces a smile. The moment threatens to become awkward\u0097until they are saved by the pilot's voice. \nPILOT \nAll aboard, folks! \nThey suddenly snap out of their mood\u0097and as they rise: \nFade out. \nFade in: Int.

B. \nCamera pans down to a jewel box which had been under the serviette. \nCamera pans back to ANN. She glances up at D. B. somewhat bewildered. \nANN \nOh! \nD. B. \nGo ahead, open it, open it. \nANN opens the box and holds up a lovely diamond bracelet. Her eyes dance. \nANN \nOh! Oh, it's lovely! \nTED \nAnd a new contract goes with it. \nWider shot: D.

The John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've heard people call them, have been laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe. \nCamera pans over to JOHN B.

I guess you must think I'm kinda batty! \nJOHN shakes his head at his own stupidity. \nJOHN \n(can't get over it) \nWell, I guess I'd better be going at that! \nHe bows again, and starts for the door. When he gets there, he is stopped by MRS. MITCHELL's voice. \nMRS. MITCHELL'S VOICE \nJohn. My husband said: \"I love you. Will you marry me?\" \nJOHN \n(whirls) \nHe did? What happened? \nMRS.

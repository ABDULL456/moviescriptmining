END MONTAGE 
185  FLYNN BACK IN HIS CELL                                       185 
for a rest period. He is pacing back and forth, and we can see Ram seated in the next cell. Flynn goes to the bars. 
FLYNN Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before? 
RAM (nostalgic, brightens) Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really 
FLYNN (about to get bored) Yeah, yeah -- that's great. 
RAM How 'bout yourself? 
FLYNN Oh, uh...I don't remember too much... 
RAM (nods) Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really... 
The POUNDING on Flynn's cell begins again. 
187  THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER                           187 
We see Flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind Sark's console. Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous, frightened of this new User-warrior. 
SARK (over his shoulder) Wait a minute...put this guy against one of the other recruits. 
188  OMIT                                                         188 
189  A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF FLYNN AND CROM                       189 
We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other. When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear. We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He looks over at Crom, who's anxious. 
FLYNN Looks like we're in the same boat here - 
CROM (jumpy) You think you're gonna wipe me right out, don't you? 
FLYNN No, I 
A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads straight for Flynn. 
Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge. 
190  FLYNN'S POV - DOWN                                           190 
down, down between the rings into an infinite pit. 
191  BACK TO FLYNN                                                191 
staring down. There's a SOUND and he looks up. 
192  HIS POV                                                      192 
Another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him. 
FLYNN Hey! 
193  FLYNN                                                        193 
reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and catching the pellet before it can' hit. He throws it back. 
194  CROM                                                         194 
Flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. Crom strains, but misses. One of his rings disappears. 
195  FLYNN reacting                                               195 
FLYNN (happy he's scored) Okay!

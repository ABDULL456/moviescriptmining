(all business) Make a right, left at the second fence. Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just came over her, looks out the window. 
HARRY 
Have I mentioned how gorgeous your breasts look in this sweater? 
MARIN 
(blushing) Yes you have actually. 
HARRY 
So it would be too much to mention it again. . . Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway, driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE. 
HARRY 
Wow. It's the perfect beach house. 
MARIN 
I know. My mother doesn't know how to do things that aren't perfect. 
HARRY 
Which explains you. That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say such a lovely thought. 
MARIN 
(trying to keep up with him) Yeah, okay, right... They both grab their H overnight bags and step out of the car. 
ARRY 
So, what are we gonna do out here, just the two of us, for two whole days? Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms around his neck. 
MARIN 
Tell me the truth, are you at all glad we waited? 
HARRY 
I'm incredibly glad we're finally going to do it. (she's a bit disappointed) If that's the same as being glad we waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic. Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that lets you kiss them. 
HARRY 
(slaps her tush) Let's go for a swim, how long will it take you to change? 
MARIN 
Two minutes. Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's cigars. 
MARIN 
Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My Mom doesn't allow it. 
HARRY 
But she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men you're dating here to... 
MARIN 
She doesn't know everything I do...Or when I do it.. or where I do it. She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD. 
INT. HOUSE 
It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to undress. 
MARIN 
(TAKING OFF her belt) The fabulous living room, perfect for entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone. (DROPS her belt then UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt) Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck complete with pool and ocean view. 
MARIN (CONT'D) 
(UNBUCKLES Harry's belt) Your pants, please... 
HARRY 
Ladies first. Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES. 
MARIN 
Gourmet kitchen's to your left where tonight I will whip you up a culinary feast of Mac and Cheese. Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile. 
MARIN 
(smiling) .. O-kay, going quickly now... Master bedroom is that away... They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM. 
M 
ARIN 
And this as they say on 'Cribs', your favorite show, is where the magic happens. Do we like it? Going once, going twice ... 
HARRY 
Sold. Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her ass. 
MARIN 
You know when I first started auctioneering someone told me if I was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear. This sort of gives that a whole new meaning. 
HARRY 
Why? You're not nervous now, are you? 
MARIN 
I'm always a little nervous. 
HARRY 
(removing his hands) So put on your bathing suit. I brought some champagne, I'll put it on ice. 
MARIN 
Me like you, Harry Langer. She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom. Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively conversation. One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's Younger Sister, ZOE. ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old. It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is. Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE". The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking 
E 
out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move. 
RICA 
Oh God. What is this? Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife. Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused. 
ERICA 
(in control) Okay, stay right where you are. We have a knife.

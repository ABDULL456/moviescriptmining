LIQUOR STORE - DAY \nA convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses surround it. \nCLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on. \nThe sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR. \nTITLE CARD: \nBIG SPRING, TEXAS 109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE 345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER \nA Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots, mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip. \nIt's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is off duty for the day. \nThe only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth \nINT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY \nA young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a stool behind the counter. \nA few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about. \nA MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and bare feet. They look through magazines. \nAnother black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around seventeen. \nMCGRAW enters the store. \nMCGRAW Hot goddamn day! \nPETE Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long. \nMCGRAW Not even for lunch? \nPETE I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave. \nMcGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and joins Pete by the front counter. \nMCGRAW Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight. \nPETE Whatsamatter? \nMCGRAW (sighs) Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty. \nPETE Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public? \nMCGRAW Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind? \nPETE You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place. \nMCGRAW What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya? \nHe helps him get his jacket off. \nSETH How's it feel? \nRICHARD How ya think, it hurts like a son-of-a-bitch. \nRichie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up against. \nSETH I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay? \nRICHARD Feels good. \nSETH I'm gonna go get the money. \nHe heads for the door. \nEXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY \nSeth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY \nSeth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping stations. Seth looks at his watch. \nSETH It's about five o'clock. (to hostage) What time does it get dark around here? \nHOSTAGE About seven. \nSETH Good. I'm going towards the border to check things out while it's still daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the rendezvous. \nRICHARD Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent. \nSETH That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us. \nRICHARD Did you even to try to negotiate? \nSETH These guys ain't spic fire cracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word \"barter\". You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent. \nRICHARD All I'm saying -- \nSETH -- This conversation is over. \nRichie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her. \nSETH Now, we need to have a talk. What's your name? \nHOSTAGE Gloria. \nHe shakes her hand. \nSETH Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my brother Richie. Let's cut to the chase. I'm gonna ask you a question and all I want is a yes or no answer. Do you want to live through this? \nGLORIA Yes. \nSETH Good. Then let me explain the house rules. Follow the rules, we'll get along like a house on fire. Rule number one: No noise, no question. You make a noise... (he holds up his .45) ...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are you absolutely, positively clear about rule number one? \nGLORIA Yes. \nSETH Rule number two: You do what we say, when we say it. If you don't, see rule number one. \nSeth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the hammer. \nSETH Rule number three: Don't you ever try and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got five little friends, and they all run faster 'n you can. Got it? \nShe nods her head yes. \nHe takes the gun away and replaces the hammer. \nSETH Open your eyes. \nShe does. \nSETH Gloria, you hang in there, follow the rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll get out of this alive. I give you my word. Okay? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CRIMINAL COURT BUILDING - DAY \nKelly Houge walks down the courthouse steps of the criminal courts building of Abilene. She talks to the camera. Cops, lawyers and citizens bustle in the background. \nKELLY HOUGE The list of the dead climbed up three more notches since our last telecast. \nCUT TO: \nPHOTO: OFFICER SHERMAN GOODELL in full police uniform. \nKELLY HOUGE (V.O.) Officer Sherman Goodell, who was in intensive care following the gun battle outside of the Valley Federal bank building... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

(it changes) \nCUT TO: \nBACK TO KELLY \nKELLY HOUGE And one hostage... \nCUT TO: \nPHOTO: GLORIA HILL \nKELLY HOUGE (V.O.) ... bank teller and mother of four, Gloria Hill. \nKELLY TO CAMERA \nKELLY HOUGE Heading the case to bring these fugitives to justice is FBI agent Stanley Chase. We talked with agent Chase earlier this afternoon. \nCUT TO: \nVIDEO INTERVIEW \nSETH What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!? \nRICHARD She's in the other room. \nSETH What the fuck is she doin' there?! \nHe goes to the door of the adjoining room. \nRICHARD Seth, before you open the door, let me explain what happened. \nSeth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means. He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling. Then he BURSTS open the door. \nThe dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's obvious Richard raped her and killed her. \nSeth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the room with the dead body. \nSETH (to himself) Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you? \nRichard rises from the bed. \nRICHARD Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me just explain what happened. \nSeth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him. \nRichard backs up. \nSETH Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you? \nRICHARD (low and calm) There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do. \nSETH No. (pause) That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful. \nRICHARD Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person. \nSETH (slowly approaching) Is it me? Is it my fault? \nRICHARD It's not your fault, it's her fault! \nSeth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room, holding tightly to his wrist. \nSETH Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am? \nRICHARD What? \nSETH This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand? \nRICHARD Seth, if you were me -- \nSETH Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes. \nRICHARD Yes. \nSETH Yes, Seth, I understand. \nRICHARD Yes, Seth, I understand. \nSeth hugs his little brother. Tight. \nSETH (whispers in Richie's ear) We get into Mexico, it's gonna be sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor, and rice and beans. None of this shit's gonna matter. \nINT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT \nScott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from the Old-Timer. \nKATE I can't believe he's stopping here. This place looks totally cruddy. \nJacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor home. \nKATE Dad, why are we stopping here? \nHe opens the meter home door and climbs in. \nJACOB There's nothing wrong with this place. \n... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the nicest guy in the entire world. \nRICHARD Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is Don Cornelius. No, not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my lady friend need some ice and we don't seem to have an ice bucket. Could we possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it right back. \nJACOB (still partially asleep) Sure. \nWe follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks. \nHe sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him. \nJACOB What is this? \nSeth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground. \nSETH It's called a punch. \nScott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's mouth. \nRICHARD Sit down. \nScott lowers himself back down onto his seat. \nRICHARD Good boy. \nJacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him. \nSETH (to Jacob) What's your name? \nJACOB Jacob. \nSETH Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face. \nJacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed. \nSETH (to Richard) Okay, move the Jap over there. \nKeeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise... \nRICHARD Upsy daisy. \n...guiding him over to the bed by his father. \nRichard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next to his brother, looking down at their two hostages. \nSETH (to his hostages) What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags? \nJACOB He's my son. \nSETH How does that happen? You don't look Japanese. \nJACOB Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese. \nSETH Oh, well, excuse me all to hell. \nJACOB What's this about, money? \nSETH It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance. \nThe door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad Kate walks in. \nThe brothers spin their guns in her direction. \nKate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun ready to spit. \nSETH (to Scott and Jacob) Stop! \nJacob and Scott freeze. \nRichard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified Kate. \nKATE What's going on? \nRICHARD We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won. \nJACOB My children are not going with you, and that's that. \nSETH (angry) That's not fuckin' that... (holds up his gun) this is fuckin' this. (he calms down and looks at Scott) Go sit over there. \nScott gets up and walks to the other side of the room, leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet, conversational tone. \nSETH I ain't got time to fuck around with you, so I'll make this simple. Take your kids and get in the car, or I'll execute all three of you right now. (he cocks the gun and puts it right in Jacob's face) What's it gonna be, yes or no answer? \nJacob looks at him. \nJACOB Yes. \nSETH Good. (to Scott) Your old man's all right, he just saved your life. \nSeth BANGS on the bathroom door. \nSETH Times up, Princess. \nThe bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a T-shirt, jeans and bare feet. \nSETH Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through the Lone Star night. \nINT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT \nRichard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands. \nKATE Excuse me. \nRichard zeros in on her. \nRICHARD What? \nKATE Where are you taking us? \nRICHARD Mexico. \nKATE What's in Mexico? \nRICHARD Mexicans. \nHe doesn't smile. \nIn the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him calmly. \nSETH (reading his driver's license) Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is. (motioning behind him) What are their names? \nJACOB Scott and Kate. \nSeth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet. \nSETH Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott... Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller... \nSeth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife. \nSETH Who's this? \nJACOB My wife. \nSETH Where is the little lady? \nJACOB In heaven. \nSETH She's dead? \nJACOB Yes, she is. \nSETH How'd she die? \nSETH Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you. (calling to the back) Kate, honey! \nKATE Yeah. \nSETH You must have a bible in here, don't cha? \nKATE Yeah, we got a bible. \nSETH Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please? \nKate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up front. \nSETH Hold it right there, sweetie pie. (to Jacob) Put your hand on it. \nJacob does. \nSETH Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border. \nJACOB I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico. \nSETH You best better get it done, Pops. \nSeth places his hand on the Bible. \nSETH I swear to God I'll let you loose in the morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I also swear if you do anything to fuck me up, I'll slit all your throats. \nTIME CUT TO: \nINT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT \nRichard's in the back with Kate and Scott. Richard, expressionless, looks at Kate's bare feet. \nSLOW ZOOM KATE'S BARE FEET \nEX CLOSE-UP KATE'S TOES. They wiggle. \nHis eyes go to her hands. \nSLOW ZOOM KATE'S HANDS \nEX CLOSE-UP KATE'S FINGERS \nHis eyes go to her neck. \nSLOW ZOOM NAPE OF KATE'S NECK \nEX CLOSE-UP KATE'S ADAM'S APPLE. She swallows. \nHis eyes move up. \nSIDE PROFILE OF KATE, SLOW ZOOM TO KATE'S LIPS \nBack to Richard. \nRICHARD Did ya mean what you said back there? \nKate turns to him. \nKATE What? \nRICHARD In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will. \nKATE Do what? \nRICHARD (in a whisper) What you said to me in the room. \nKATE (whispers back) What did I say? \nRICHARD (whisper) You asked me if I would -- \nSETH (O.S.) Richard! \nRICHARD (to Seth) What? \nRICHARD What does that mean? \nSETH (distracted) What? \nRichard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side. \nRICHARD You just called me a fuckin' nut. \nSETH No, I didn't. \nRICHARD Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut. \nSETH Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool. \nRICHARD You meant that, but you meant the other, too. \nKate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth. \nSETH (serious as a heart attack) This ain't the time, Richard. \nRICHARD (his voice rising) Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks. \nSETH (real quiet and violent) Keep your voice down. \nRICHARD (quiet back) Or what? \nBACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT \nJACOB Have you forgotten about your sister? \nSCOTT They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us. \nJACOB If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go. \nSCOTT Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance. \nJACOB What about Kate? \nSCOTT They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance. \nJACOB Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this. \nSCOTT If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will. \nJacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him to him. \nJACOB Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions. \nSCOTT He's running the show. \nJACOB I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to \"go for it.\" I need your cover. Cover my ass. \nThere's a HONK behind them. \nThey both look out the window. It's their turn with the BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up. \nA stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window. \nBORDER GUARD How many with you? \nJACOB Just my son and I. \nBORDER GUARD What is your purpose in Mexico? \nJACOB Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight. \nBACK TO BATHROOM \nRICHARD I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did? \nSETH This ain't the time. \nRICHARD Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now. \nHe charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist, and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles dizzily onto the bed. \nSETH (to Kate) You were magnificent! You told him to shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in the shower, and I'm thinking to myself, \"Did I just fuckin' hear what I just fuckin' heard? And what does he do -- he shuts the fucking door! \nKate kind of half smiles. \nSETH If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd fuckin' marry you! \nSeth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back. \nSETH I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you raised a fuckin' woman. \nJacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved. \nJACOB We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go. \nSETH Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right. \nKATE (suddenly brightens) You're gonna let us go? \nSETH In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, \"Digayo.\" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called \"The Titty Twister.\" From what I hear, you can't miss it. \nJACOB Then? \nSETH Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going. \nHe slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend to Richard. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps his face. \nSETH (O.S.) C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a career out of it. \nRichard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the foot of the bed. \nSETH You okay? \nRICHARD (disoriented) Yeah, I think so. What happened? \nSETH I don't know, you just passed out. \nRICHARD I did? \nSETH Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. \nRICHARD Really? \nSETH Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay? \nRICHARD Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up. \nSETH Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans. \nRICHARD What? \nSETH We are... (singing) \"South of the border down Mexico way.\" \nRICHARD We are? \nSETH Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples? \nSlowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head. \nRICHARD Far out. (pause) Where are my glasses? \nSETH They broke when you fell. \nRICHARD Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair! \nSETH Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses. \nRICHARD What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see. \nRICHARD Where are you right now? \nSETH What do you mean? \nRICHARD Where are you? \nSETH I'm here with you. \nRICHARD No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother. \nSETH My shit is together. \nRICHARD It don't look together. \nSETH Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together. \nRichard believes Seth's response. \nRICHARD Okay, just checkin'. \nThey walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into the microphone. \nCHET (yelling into the microphone) Take advantage of our penny pussy sale. Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular price, you get another piece of pussy, of equal or lesser value, for a penny. Now try and beat pussy for a penny! If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere, fuck it! \nChet notices our heroes, especially young Kate. \nCHET (in microphone, towards Kate) What's this? A new flavor approaching. Apple Pie Pussy. \nSETH Step aside, asshole. \nChet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST. \nCHET Not so fast, Slick. \nSeth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till the BONE SNAPS in two. \nChet lets out a SCREAM. \nSeth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's NOSE. \nChet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth. \nSeth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK. \nAfter HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER. \nChet is OUT. \nThe whole altercation took two seconds. \nEveryone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at everyone. \nSETH Now, is my shit together, or is my shit together? \nRichard and Seth laugh with each other. \nRICHARD (slappin' Seth five) Your shit is forever together! \nThey head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second, and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks, \nINT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT \nIf the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, \"You ain't seen nothin' yet.\" This is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and the beer at closing. \nIn the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers, while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers. \nOne of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the crowd. \nBikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em, but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em. \nSeth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door. They each individually take in the sights and the smells. Seth is the first to say something. \nSETH Now this is my kinda place! I could become a regular. \nRichie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys. \nJacob and Scott are embarrassed. \nKate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared. \nSeth laughs out loud a Mexican \"yi yi yiii\" laugh, keeping the beat with his guitar. \nAcross the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet. \nRichard continues to suck her toes. \nThe song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks down at the seated Richard. \nShe GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds, none louder than Seth. \nSETH Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what I call a fuckin' show! \nOne of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe, which she puts on. \nRichard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend. \nSETH (snapping his fingers) Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us? \nRICHARD Yeah. \nSETH Well, then ask her, dumb ass. \nRICHARD (looking up at Santanico) Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us? \nSANTANICO (to Richard) Muy bien, gracias. \nSantanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink. \nSETH Richie, you lucky bastard! (to Santanico) Now, little lady, you could of just as easily done that to me. Who a Nelly! You got my dick harder 'n Chinese arithmetic. \nThe table laughs. \nSETH Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says: \"Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?\" Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: \"No he won't.\" \nAs Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table. \nJACOB (to himself) Oh, shit. (to Seth) Seth -- \nSeth waves him away. \nSETH Not now. So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf's laughing and says: \"Little Red Riding Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You know I'm just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties.\" Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says: \"No you won't. You're gonna eat me, just like the story says.\" \nSeth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard, Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say anything -- \nThe Titty Twister trio stand over the table. \nRAZOR CHARLIE (to Chet in Spanish) Which one? \nCHET (pointing at Seth) This piece of shit broke my finger and my nose... (pointing at Richard) then this fag kicked me in the ribs while I was down. \nThat's all Big Emilio has to hear. \nBIG EMILIO (to The Gecko Brothers) Up! \nRICHARD Fuck off, ape man! \nBig Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from his wounded shoulder. \nSantanico steps back from the table. \nSeth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor. Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake and SLASHES Seth across the face. \nSeth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to his laid open cheek. \nRichard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound, brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING. \nRazor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly before he hits the floor. \nThe patrons scream. \nA WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar and yells: \nWHORE Dinner is served! \nThe bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping VAMPIRES. \nThe vamps attack. \nWhat follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven necks. \nNaked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other. Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size. The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades, anything. \nJacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar. They hide and watch. \nSeth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand, too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands motionless, watching what he can't believe. \nBehind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard, eyes POP OPEN. \nShe RISES in her snake/dance way. \nSeth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised. \nSANTANICO Let's see if you taste as good as your brother. \nShe approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified. \nSantanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the FLOOR and INTO the WALL. \nA bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps. \nBig Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other. \nThe biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE, goes head to head with a stripper. \nThe vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow. \nThen he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her on the wooden leg. \nFROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie appears, straight razor in hand. \nFrost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half. Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue in Razor Charlie's heart. \nGreen blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the vampire's death scream. \nSeth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest. \nSANTANICO I'm not gonna drain you completely. You're gonna turn for me, You'll be my slave. You'll live for me. You'll eat bugs because I order it. Because I don't think you're worthy of human blood, you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool. And at my command, you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel. Since you'll be my dog, your new name will be \"Spot\". Welcome to slavery. \nSLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing end over end. \nCLOSE-UP SANTANICO \nlooking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING. \nWe see that Jacob behind the bar threw it. \nSantanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth. \nSeth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires. \nSantanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes the liquor-soaked robe ignite. \nSantanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES. \nBig Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry. \nBIG EMILIO Noooooo! \nHe turns his hateful gaze on the two humans. \nSeth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to Jacob. \nIt vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay. \nThey all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging. \nExcept for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it. \nHe takes his dead hand. \nSETH Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up. You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd find peace there. I love you little brother, I'll miss ya bad. \nSeth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise. \nRICHARD I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I love you, too. \nRichard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away. He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine. \nSETH Touch my brother with that stake, biker, and vampires won't need to suck your blood, they'll be able to lick it up off the floor. \nSEX MACHINE He ain't your brother no more. \nSETH That's a matter of opinion, and I don't give a fuck about your's. \nJacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to the ground. \nJACOB Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all! \nSeth aims his gun at the group. \nSETH Shut up! \nRichard's giggling. \nRICHARD Yeah, shut up. \nSeth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45. \nSETH Hold him down. \nThe smile evaporates from Richard's face. \nSETH Richie, here's the peace in death I could never give you in life. \nSeth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo. Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate, of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at the bar. \nKATE Are you okay? \nSETH Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory. \nKATE I'm really sorry. \nSETH Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them! \nJACOB Then why didn't I? \nJacob walks over to Seth. \nJACOB I saved your life. I didn't have to, but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're gonna get out of this we need each other. And we need you sober and thinking, not drunk and... \nAs Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to identify it. \nJACOB What the hell is that? \nFROST At first I just thought it was birds. \nSEX MACHINE No, it's more of a gnawing sound. Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats gnaw. \nSeth puts the bottle in his hand down. \nSETH It's bats. \nEXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT \nThe outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get inside. \nJACOB Okay, does anybody here know what's going on? \nSETH Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about \"I don't believe in vampires\" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires. \nEverybody agrees. \nSETH You too, preacher? \nJACOB I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw. \nSETH Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross? \nJACOB In the Winnebago. \nSETH In other words, no. \nSCOTT What are you talking about? We got crosses all over the place. All you gotta do is put two sticks together and you got a cross. \nSEX MACHINE He's right. Peter Cushing does that all the time. \nSETH I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix. \nJACOB What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness. \nSETH Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else? \nFROST Wooden stakes in the heart been workin' pretty good so far. \nSEX MACHINE Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I forget, does silver do anything to a vampire? \nSCOTT That's werewolves. \nSEX MACHINE I know silver bullets are werewolves. But I'm pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires. \nKATE Does anybody have any silver? \nALL No. \nKATE Then who cares? \nSCOTT When's sunrise? \nJacob looks at his watch. \nJACOB About two hours from now. \nKATE So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door. \nSEX MACHINE Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our barricades, that door, those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin' with 'em. \nJACOB Has anybody here read a real book about vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? I mean a real book. \nSEX MACHINE You mean like a Time-Life book? \nEverybody laughs. \nFROST (in a cowboy voice) John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once shot a man for snorin'. \nJACOB I take it the answer's no. Okay then, what do we know about these vampires? \nSETH Aside from they're thirsty. \nFROST Well, one thing, they might got super human strength, but you can hurt 'em. \nJACOB Yeah, that bottle upside the head of Santanico didn't kill her, but it didn't feel too good either. \nSEX MACHINE Another thing, you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son-of-a-bitch. The human body is one rough-tough machine. But these vamps got soft bodies. The texture of their skin is softer, mushier. You can push shit right through 'em. Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough, you could take their fuckin' head off. \nSCOTT You could take their head off. \nSETH Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. (he points at Jacob) He's a preacher. \nFrost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob. \nFrost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his bleeding neck. \nFROST I been bit! He fuckin' bit me! \nSex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a sack of potatoes. \nHe smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a table. \nSex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table leg. Frost looks at the big vamp. \nFROST (to Sex Machine) You're dead, mother fucker! You're gonna bite me! You just turned me into a vampire, asshole! \nSEX MACHINE What are you gonna do about it? \nFrost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off, straight at Sex Machine. \nSex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and pulls it back, so he can really haul off. \nFrost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air. \nSeth sees where Frost is heading and says: \nSETH Oh shit! \nJacob sees. \nJACOB Good lord! \nFrost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow and CRASHES through it. \nSex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom. \nBehind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground. \nTen bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott, who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams, howls and snaps in fury. \nSeth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his .45 in its big mouth. \nSETH You wanna suck something, suck on this! \nHe FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over the wall. \nKate yells: \nKATE We have to go back for Daddy! \nSETH Daddy's dead. \nKATE Noooo! \nShe spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up against the wall. \nSCOTT He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them. \nSETH He needs our help! \nSCOTT He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together. \nJust then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room. \nINT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT \nJacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures. \nThe creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad, whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone. As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant sight trip him up. \nJacob has backed himself up by the door. \nJACOB Open the door. \nThe door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS shut. \nJacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his bloody arm. \nSCOTT Yeah, I promise. \nJacob doesn't believe them. \nJACOB Why don't I believe you? (he picks up the .45) I'm gonna ask you two again, then I want you to swear to God that you'll kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna just kill myself right now. Now, since you need me I think you better swear. Kate, do you swear to God that when I turn into one of the undead, you'll kill me? \nKate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his temple. \nJACOB Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four... \nKATE Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it! \nJACOB Not good enough, swear to God. \nKATE I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you. \nJACOB Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One... \nSCOTT You don't believe in suicide. \nJACOB It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two... \nSCOTT Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name. \nJACOB Thank you, son. \nSETH Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some fuckin' vampires. \nINT. BARROOM - NIGHT \nThe vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through the door. \nWaiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside. \nWhat we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la \"The Wild Bunch.\" A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then, like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer. \nSETH Kill 'em all! \nJacob holds up the cross, the vamps react. \nThe kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire flesh. \nThe pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk forward. \nThey are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door. \nSeth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood. \nJacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other. \nFlame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit. \nKate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd. \nThey burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain. \nFrom its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and HURLS toward the group. \nJacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES. \nThe bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire. \nSeth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests. \nThe front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk. \nSCOTT (yelling) Why did they block the door again? \nJACOB (yelling) To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door! \nSeth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth off the ground. \nSeth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room, he CRASHES into a table. \nSCOTT Kill me, Kate! \nKate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times. \nOne... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott. \nThe remaining vamps approach. \nAll the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon. \nSETH How many bullets left, kid? \nKATE Not many. \nSETH Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper. \nThe two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. \nThe two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched. \nKATE (to Seth) Should I use the last bullets on us? \nSETH You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you. \nThe vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire. \nSeth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. \nBeams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before. \nSETH Shoot more holes! \nKate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area. \nThe .45's empty. \nThe vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. \nThe two survivors hold hands, when... \nAll of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside. \nThe vamps look towards it in horror. \nFrom the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent. \nVOICE (O.S.) (in Spanish) I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in there? \nSETH (yelling) Carlos! (in Spanish) Help us, bash the door. Bash the door in! \nCARLOS (O.S.) (in Spanish) Danny, Manny, knock down the door. Hurry, hurry! \nThe vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto each other. \nThe front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door. \nThe table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward. \nThe door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames. \nThe Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves in fright. \nVampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps combust in fiery explosions. \nThe Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control. \nSeth and Kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot. \nEXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING \nCarlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by Carlos's Mercedes. \nCARLOS (to Seth) What the fuck was going on in there? \n", "test1_input": "SETH (to Richard) What the fuck was that about? \nRICHARD (in a low monotone) He signaled the Ranger. \nPETE (hysterical) I didn't. (to Seth) You gotta believe me, I didn't. \nRICHARD (to Seth) When they were talkin', he mouthed the words \"Help Us.\" \nPETE You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit! \nRichard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter. \nSeth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall. \nSETH What the fuck is wrong with you -- \nRICHARD Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face. And I saw him mouth: \nRichard mouths the words, \"Help Us.\" \nWhile Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls out a gun from it. \nSeth releases his brother. \nSETH Start the car. \nRICHARD You believe me don't cha? \nSETH Shut up and start the car. \nRichard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter... \n...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in the hand. \nRichard FALLS to his knees, howling. \nBoth Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire. \nSeth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads. \nPete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads. \nRichard has crawled to safety behind an aisle. \nThe two girls have run out screaming. \nSETH (yelling) Richie? You okay? \nRICHARD (yelling) I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, \"Help us!\" \nPETE (yelling) I never said help us! \nSETH (yelling) Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie! \nRICHARD (yelling) Yeah? \nSETH (yelling) When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him! \nRICHARD Gotcha! \nSETH One... Two... Three. \nThe two brothers start FIRING toward the counter. \nThey HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete. \nPete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol RAIN down on him. \nSeth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf. \nRichard keeps FIRING. \nSeth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on fire with his Zippo, then tosses it. \n", "test1_true": "The fireball lands behind the counter. \nThe entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete screams from behind the counter. \nSeth smiles to himself and stands. \nRichard shakes his head in amusement and stands. \nPete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES still holding his weapon and FIRING. \nSeth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's. \nPete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess Pastry display. \nSeth and Richard rise from the rubble. \nEXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY \nThey exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into flames. \nSETH What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave. \nRICHARD What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us. \nSETH He didn't recognize shit. \nBoth Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car. \nRICHARD Seth, I'm telling you, the way he looked at us -- you especially -- I knew he knew. \nThey both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can hear Seth mumbling under the motor. \nSETH Low profile. Do you know what the words \"low profile\" mean? \nCLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS. \nThe Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits the street, and speeds off down the road. \nWe CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust behind it, as the store burns out of control. \nOPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE. \nRaunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY \nThe Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle. \nRichard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape. \nThe camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street, and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman: \nAN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk. \nThe rest of the titles play over black as the song continues. \nCREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY \nEmma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway \nSUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN': \nFORT STOCKTON 238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER \nINT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY \n", "test2_input": "Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers, cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses. \nIt stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary category. The members of the unit consist of the father, JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges, and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who possesses what can only be described as an apple pie sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl, complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal garage band he plays guitar for, \"Precinct 13.\" The three of them are wolfing down a late lunch. \nJACOB We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel -- \nSCOTT Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we? \nScott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something that Jacob has said about three hundred times. \nSCOTT AND KATE We've got a Winnebago. We don't need those over priced roach havens. We're self contained. \nJACOB Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little overzealous, but give me a break, I just bought it. \nScott and Kate continue the impersonation. \nSCOTT Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen -- \nKATE -- you got your microwave -- \nSCOTT -- you got your sink -- \nKATE -- you got your shower -- \nSCOTT -- see this, television! \nKATE Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff. \nJACOB Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this? \nSCOTT (to Kate) The truth hurts. \nKATE (to Scott) It's the bitterest of pills. \nJACOB You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me. \nKATE Ain't it the truth. \nSCOTT Why do you want to stop? \nJACOB I'm exhausted. \nSCOTT Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico. \nJacob gives Scott a look that says, \"You aren't touching my new motor home.\" \nJACOB I just bet you would. Don't even thin about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed. \nKATE Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim. \nSCOTT I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. \nScott gets up from the table and walks out back to the restroom. \nJacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of silence before... \nKATE Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way -- \nJACOB That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting. \nKATE I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore? \nJACOB Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point? \nKATE (pushing him) It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him? \nJACOB I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore. \nKATE That happens, you'll get it back. \nJACOB Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore. \nKATE What do you think Mom would say? \n", "test2_true": "CUT TO: \nCLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING. \nINT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY \nSeth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car. Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five times. \nTEXAS VOICE (O.S.) Hold your horses! \nAn OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter. He's eating a BBQ rib. \nOLD-TIMER (rough) Whatcha want? \nSETH Whatcha think I want, ya mean old bastard? I wanna room. \nEXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY \nRichard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up, and drives them to their room. \nRICHARD Do they have cable? \nSETH No. \nRICHARD Do they have an X-rated channel? \nSETH No. \nRICHARD Do they have a waterbed? \nSETH They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need. \nTheir car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the trunk close to the door. \nThe two brothers get out of the car. \nSETH (tossing Richie the motel keys) Open the door. We gotta do this fast. \nRichie opens the door. \nSeth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's empty. \nCLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning. \nTRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera. \nSETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched up in the trunk. \nShe is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff, scared and looks an absolute mess. \nSETH Don't say a word. \nThe two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't see any, slams the door. \nINT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY \nSeth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing. \nSETH You. Plant yourself in that chair. \nShe sits down in the chair. \nHOSTAGE What are you planning on doing with -- \nSETH -- I said plant yourself. Plants don't talk. You wanna get on my good side? Just sit still and don't make a peep. \nShe shuts up. \nRichard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his wound. \nSETH Let me help you. \n", "test3_input": "RAZOR CHARLIE Best in Mexico. \nSETH I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order. \nSeth walks away, and the group follows him. \nWe just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head. \nThe five of them move across the floor to a table. As they walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter. \nThe dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him. \nRichard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear. \nRICHARD Anytime you want a lap dance with that broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo. \nHe gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange words about the party in Spanish. \nRAZOR CHARLIE (in Spanish) They're not the normal road trash we normally feed on. But it'll be okay. No one knows they're here. \nThe five of them find a table and sit down. \nSeth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass. \nSETH Who else? \nJACOB Pass. \nSETH (picking a fight) Why not, against your religion? \nJACOB (won't be baited) No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now. \nSETH Suit yourself, more for me. (to Scott) Scotty? \nScott shakes his head no. \nSETH (to Kate) How 'bout you? (pointing at Scott and Kate) are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. (to Scott) Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink? \nSCOTT Okay, I'll have one. \nJACOB No you won't. \nSeth pours Scott a shot. \nSETH Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms up, boy. \nScott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an on-drinker's tremor. \nSeth turns to Kate. \nSETH How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two? \nKATE Okay. \nSeth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and knocks it back. \nRICHARD (to Seth) Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you just created a monster. \nJacob turns to Seth and asks quietly. \nJACOB Why are you so agitated? \nSETH I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too. \nJACOB He backed down. \nSETH He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', \"Fuck you Jack.\" I hear that loud and clear. \nJACOB What are you going to do? \nSETH (picking up the whiskey bottle) I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head. \nJACOB Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too. \n", "test3_true": "JACOB Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won? \nRichard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays down his drinking glass. \nSETH What did you call me? \nJACOB Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won? (pause) The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it. \nSeth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle. \nSETH Jacob, I want you to have a drink with me. I insist. \nJacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses. \nSETH To your family. \nJACOB To yours. \nThey both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down. \nJACOB Now, is your shit together? \nSETH Forever together. \nSeth turns to Scott. \nSETH In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours. \nSCOTT Yeah, it's mine. \nSETH Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on. \nCUT TO: \nSeth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the song. Everybody applauds. \nRazor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone that he uses to announce dancers. \nRAZOR CHARLIE (announcer voice in Spanish) And now for your viewing pleasure. The Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome of Evil. The most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth. Lowly dogs, get on your knees, bow your heads and worship at the feet of SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM! \nThe lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening notes of the Coaster's \"Down in Mexico\" fills the room. \nThe crowd hushes up. \nAnd on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM. \nThis Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that Stendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. \nShe dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. \nAnd if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession. \nAll activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. \nWhen the music builds to its explosive section. \nSantanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room. \nShe does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened. \nAs the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table. \nRichard, Kate and Scott are enraptured. \nSantanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him. \nWhile moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg. \nShe lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face. \nSANTANICO (to Richard in Spanish) Drink up. \n"}

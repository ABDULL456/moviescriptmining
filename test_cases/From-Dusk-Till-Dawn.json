{"test1_input": "... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the nicest guy in the entire world. \nRICHARD Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is Don Cornelius. No, not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my lady friend need some ice and we don't seem to have an ice bucket. Could we possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it right back. \nJACOB (still partially asleep) Sure. \nWe follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks. \nHe sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him. \nJACOB What is this? \nSeth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground. \nSETH It's called a punch. \nScott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's mouth. \nRICHARD Sit down. \nScott lowers himself back down onto his seat. \nRICHARD Good boy. \nJacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him. \nSETH (to Jacob) What's your name? \nJACOB Jacob. \nSETH Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face. \nJacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed. \nSETH (to Richard) Okay, move the Jap over there. \nKeeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise... \nRICHARD Upsy daisy. \n...guiding him over to the bed by his father. \nRichard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next to his brother, looking down at their two hostages. \nSETH (to his hostages) What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags? \nJACOB He's my son. \nSETH How does that happen? You don't look Japanese. \nJACOB Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese. \nSETH Oh, well, excuse me all to hell. \nJACOB What's this about, money? \nSETH It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance. \nThe door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad Kate walks in. \nThe brothers spin their guns in her direction. \nKate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun ready to spit. \nSETH (to Scott and Jacob) Stop! \nJacob and Scott freeze. \nRichard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified Kate. \nKATE What's going on? \nRICHARD We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won. \n", "test1_true": "SETH Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. (he turns to Jacob and Scott, who are still standing) You two, Simon says sit the fuck down! \nThey slowly sit. \nRichard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate. \nBoth Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both for their own reasons. \nSETH (to Jacob) Where are the keys to the motor home? \nJACOB On the dresser. \nSETH Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front. \nRichard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him. \nHe looks in her face. \nCLOSE-UP KATE She smiles at him. \nKATE Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy? \nCLOSE-UP RICHARD RICHARD Sure. \nSETH (O.S.) Richard! \nRichard's eyes go to Seth. \nEverybody is where they were. Kate never turned around. \nSETH Not when you get around to it, now. \nWithout saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the room. \nSETH (pointing at Kate) You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and put on some clothes. \nShe grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the bathroom. \nSeth GRABS her wrist. \nSETH You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said? \nKATE Yes. \nSETH Do you believe me? \nKATE Yes. \nSETH You damn well better. Go. \nShe goes into the bathroom. \nJACOB Look, if you want the motor home, just take it and get out. \nSeth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages. \nSETH Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that easy. \nWe hear the motor home \"HONK\" twice outside. \nSETH Get ready to move out, we're all going on a little ride. \nJacob shakes his head \"no.\" \nJACOB Not a chance. \nSETH Come again? \nJACOB If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you. \nSETH Sorry, I need everybody. \n", "test1_id": 2424, "test2_input": "RAZOR CHARLIE Best in Mexico. \nSETH I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order. \nSeth walks away, and the group follows him. \nWe just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head. \nThe five of them move across the floor to a table. As they walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter. \nThe dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him. \nRichard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear. \nRICHARD Anytime you want a lap dance with that broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo. \nHe gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange words about the party in Spanish. \nRAZOR CHARLIE (in Spanish) They're not the normal road trash we normally feed on. But it'll be okay. No one knows they're here. \nThe five of them find a table and sit down. \nSeth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass. \nSETH Who else? \nJACOB Pass. \nSETH (picking a fight) Why not, against your religion? \nJACOB (won't be baited) No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now. \nSETH Suit yourself, more for me. (to Scott) Scotty? \nScott shakes his head no. \nSETH (to Kate) How 'bout you? (pointing at Scott and Kate) are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. (to Scott) Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink? \nSCOTT Okay, I'll have one. \nJACOB No you won't. \nSeth pours Scott a shot. \nSETH Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms up, boy. \nScott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an on-drinker's tremor. \nSeth turns to Kate. \nSETH How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two? \nKATE Okay. \nSeth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and knocks it back. \nRICHARD (to Seth) Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you just created a monster. \nJacob turns to Seth and asks quietly. \nJACOB Why are you so agitated? \nSETH I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too. \nJACOB He backed down. \nSETH He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', \"Fuck you Jack.\" I hear that loud and clear. \nJACOB What are you going to do? \nSETH (picking up the whiskey bottle) I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head. \nJACOB Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too. \n", "test2_true": "JACOB Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won? \nRichard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays down his drinking glass. \nSETH What did you call me? \nJACOB Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won? (pause) The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it. \nSeth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle. \nSETH Jacob, I want you to have a drink with me. I insist. \nJacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses. \nSETH To your family. \nJACOB To yours. \nThey both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down. \nJACOB Now, is your shit together? \nSETH Forever together. \nSeth turns to Scott. \nSETH In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours. \nSCOTT Yeah, it's mine. \nSETH Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on. \nCUT TO: \nSeth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the song. Everybody applauds. \nRazor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone that he uses to announce dancers. \nRAZOR CHARLIE (announcer voice in Spanish) And now for your viewing pleasure. The Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome of Evil. The most sinister woman to dance on the face of the earth. Lowly dogs, get on your knees, bow your heads and worship at the feet of SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM! \nThe lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening notes of the Coaster's \"Down in Mexico\" fills the room. \nThe crowd hushes up. \nAnd on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM. \nThis Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that Stendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. \nShe dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. \nAnd if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession. \nAll activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. \nWhen the music builds to its explosive section. \nSantanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the room. \nShe does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie and points at Seth's table, describing what happened. \nAs the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table. \nRichard, Kate and Scott are enraptured. \nSantanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him. \nWhile moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg. \nShe lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face. \nSANTANICO (to Richard in Spanish) Drink up. \n", "test2_id": 2425, "test3_input": "SCOTT Kill me, Kate! \nKate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three times. \nOne... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott. \nThe remaining vamps approach. \nAll the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon. \nSETH How many bullets left, kid? \nKATE Not many. \nSETH Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper. \nThe two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. \nThe two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched. \nKATE (to Seth) Should I use the last bullets on us? \nSETH You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you. \nThe vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire. \nSeth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. \nBeams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before. \nSETH Shoot more holes! \nKate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area. \nThe .45's empty. \nThe vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. \nThe two survivors hold hands, when... \nAll of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside. \nThe vamps look towards it in horror. \nFrom the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent. \nVOICE (O.S.) (in Spanish) I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in there? \nSETH (yelling) Carlos! (in Spanish) Help us, bash the door. Bash the door in! \nCARLOS (O.S.) (in Spanish) Danny, Manny, knock down the door. Hurry, hurry! \nThe vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto each other. \nThe front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door. \nThe table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward. \nThe door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames. \nThe Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves in fright. \nVampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps combust in fiery explosions. \nThe Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control. \nSeth and Kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot. \nEXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING \nCarlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by Carlos's Mercedes. \nCARLOS (to Seth) What the fuck was going on in there? \n", "test3_true": "CARLOS (in Spanish) Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy? \nSETH Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place? \nCARLOS I don't know, one place's as good as another. \nSETH Have you ever been there before? \nCARLOS No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning. \nSETH Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead. \nCarlos stands up again. \nCARLOS I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos? \nSETH Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are. \nDanny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing themselves again. \nCARLOS Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you? \nSETH You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start. \nCARLOS Twenty-eight. \nSETH Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty. \nThey look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison. \nSETH AND CARLOS (in Spanish) Twenty-five. \nSeth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over to a red 1990 Porsche 911. \nCARLOS You like the car? \nSETH I said new, this is an '90. \nCARLOS It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new. \nSETH So do I just follow you? \nCARLOS Yeah, follow us. \nSETH So let's do it. \nCARLOS (to Danny and Manny) Vamanos! \nCarlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes. \nSeth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate. \nKate stands alone. \nThe whole desert seems between them. \nSo much to say ... but no words. \nSETH I'm sorry. \nKATE Me too. \nLong pause. \nSETH See ya. \nKATE Later. \nSeth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate says behind him: \nKATE (O.S.) Seth. \n", "test3_id": 2426}

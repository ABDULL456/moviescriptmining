STANLEY Trust you? Two hours ago I found out you're D.E.A. The feds are crawling up my ass and there's a dead body in the basement that looks just like Gabriel. 
She doesn't move. 
GINGER Stanley, if we don't find out who he's working for then we're just going to have to do this all over again. 
STANLEY Your little slush fund is not my problem. I'm pulling the plug on this rodeo. Roberts may be an asshole, but he is definitely the lesser of the two evils. 
GINGER I've been working on this thing for eight months, and I will not let some jarhead fed fuck up my operation. Please, I know what I'm doing.

GINGER C'mon, Stanley. You have twelve hours. Do what he wants. Finish the worm. 
STANLEY You're starting to sound just like him. 
They look at each other.    Stanley turns toward the computer screens. FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN:

97   CLOSEUP - FLY-FISHING REEL                                      97 
as it quickly unwinds. 
EXT. RIVER - MORNING 
Reisman, dressed in your average, fly-fishing garb, stands in the shallow water of a wide river, thinking he has contained the situation, is doing what he enjoys most. He rewinds the reel and flicks it out again; the hook sails into the distance. 
A huge Cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin. 
Faintly, we hear the WHINE OF MACHINERY. Jim hears it, too, odd since we are so far in the boonies. He looks around, then up and we PUSH IN TO a CLOSEUP. 
REISMAN'S POV 
An evil-looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the hill directly above him, ROTORS THUMPING. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Reisman ducking, his cigar falling from his mouth, has to fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat.

ANGLE FROM ABOVE HELICOPTER 
Water sprays everywhere as it hovers. 
Slowly it drifts over to the bank and lowers where it touches down briefly, the side door slides open. 
ANGLE (SLOW MOTION) 
as Gabriel steps out and walks TOWARD us.     The copter lifts off behind him. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at his right. Gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter disappears over the rise. Reisman is not happy. 
GABRIEL (sniffing in air) Ahh, the great American outdoors. I'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff. 
Gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something. 
GABRIEL This's a catch-and-release stream, isn't it? 
REISMAN That's right. 
Gabriel starts to laugh.      Reisman doesn't catch the joke. 
GABRIEL Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the irony in the chairman of the Joint Sub-Committee on Crime, fishing in a catch-and-release stream. 
CLOSEUP - REISMAN 
Grimaces, not thinking it is funny.

WIDER 
GABRIEL How could you do it, Jim? After all we have sacrificed. All the blood, all the death... I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore. How could you turn on me when we are so close? 
REISMAN You did this to yourself. 
GABRIEL You brought me in to get the job done and you didn't want to know about the consequences.

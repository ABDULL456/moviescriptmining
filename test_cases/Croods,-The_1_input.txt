GRUG How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy. 
UGGA It is a little, dark, Grug. 
GRUG It's not that dark. 
Grug is finished with his bath. 
GRUG (CONT'D) (LOSING PATIENCE) Eep! Eep? 
Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Come on, I gotta close the cave... 
ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the very top. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Eep! 
Eep continues to climb. EEP Okay, okay! 
GRUG Come on. 
Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug sees the BearOwl in full attack mode. 
GRUG (CONT'D) EEP! COME DOWN!! 
Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug barely gets the cave closed in time. 
GRUG (CONT'D) SIGH 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY 
The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening, and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like mice in this world. 
GRUG That was too close! 
EEP I was watching. I was fine. 
GRUG What were you doing up there, Eep? 
EEP I don't know. 
GRUG What were you looking for? 
EEP Nothing. 
GRUG Well then why did you go up there? 
EEP (ANNOYED) I don't know. GRUG Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid. 
Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in. 
EEP (TO HERSELF) What's the point of all this? 
GRUG Hmmm? What was that? 
EEP (a little louder) I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for? 
CROODS GROAN 
GRUG No one said survival was fun. 
EEP Nothing is fun. 
GRUG Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep? 
No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down. 
UGGA Grug. Off.

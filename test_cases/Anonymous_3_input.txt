A FOOTMAN clears his throat and-- 
FOOTMAN By the grace of god, her majesty, Elizabeth, Queen of England, Wales and Ireland! 
DOUBLE DOORS 
open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a wide collar. 
She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her (Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un-human. 
Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel- encrusted doublet. 
Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm. 
Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton-- 
ESSEX (to Elizabeth) Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord of Southampton has a gift for you. 
ELIZABETH (eyes sparkle) A gift? 
SOUTHAMPTON Yes, your grace, though not from me. 
Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room OPENS. 
A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music. 
pg. 23 
Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face. 
Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified. 
ELIZABETH Are you this gift, my precious little man? 
DWARF No, no, my most majestic majesty. I am a free man. My gift is a play, majesty. 
ELIZABETH A play? 
The dwarf bows his assent. 
ROBERT CECIL (to the Dwarf) Plays are the work of the devil, born from a cesspool of plague, whoredom, thievery, fornication, and heresy. You may tell your master that her majesty-- 
ESSEX (interrupting) --Will gladly accept your gift. 
Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) (to Elizabeth) Of course that is if you so desire, majesty. (to Robert Cecil) The choice is her majesty's to make, not yours. Is that not so Sir Robert? 
Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the political tides around her. Then-- 
ELIZABETH (to the dwarf) Comedy? Or tragedy? 
DWARF Comedy, majesty. 
ELIZABETH (delighted) A comedy! (MORE) pg. 24 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) (beat) By whom? 
DWARF By... Anonymous, your majesty... 
ELIZABETH Anonymous...? (then) Oh, but I do so admire his verse... 
Elizabeth lets go of Essex, and offers her hand to the Dwarf, who smiles brightly. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Lead us to this gift. 
And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door. Essex follows, and Southampton locks into step next to him. They exchange a knowing look as-- 
Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen, not happy with this turn of events as we hear-- 
"QUINCE" (O.S.) Bless thee, Bottom! Bless thee!      Thou art translated! 
CUT TO: 
23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23 
Sheer magic. Candles everywhere: in stakes, in the ground, in the trees. They light a make-shift "stage" surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides. 
"BOTTOM" I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me; to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir from this place, do what they can. 
Chairs have been brought out and put in rows in the grass. Elizabeth is watching center front row (of course). She loves it, SQUEALING in delight like a young woman. Essex is next to her.

ON STAGE 
Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man-- except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck hides behind a tree watching. 
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D) I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid. 
BACKSTAGE 
Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep emotion in him. 
ON STAGE 
"BOTTOM" (CONT'D) (sings) The ousel cock so black of hue, With orange-tawny bill, The throstle with his note so true, The wren with little quill-- 
Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur. 
"TITANIA" What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed? 
ELIZABETH 
strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some memory in her. A pleasant memory. 
OXFORD 
watches, delighted by her reaction. 
FROM HIS POV

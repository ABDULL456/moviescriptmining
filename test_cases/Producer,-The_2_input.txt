DE BRIS I mean in show business. 
LSD Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut. 
DE BRIS What do you do best? 
LSD Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for. 
DE BRIS Oh, sing.  Sing! 
LSD Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up? 
DE BRIS (a little hysterical) Sing a song!  Just sing a song! 
LSD Here's a little thing I think you're going to see on the charts any day.  I wrote it last night in my sleep.  It's a Hindu Zen Folk Rock Ballad. 
LSD SINGS "I'M THE VICTIM OF A MULTI-MYSTIC FREAK-OUT." THE SONG IS GEARED TO THE AU COURANT "RAGA ROCK" BEAT.  PHRASES SUCH AS, "CONNECT WITH THE INFINITE" AND "TURN ON THE WORLD." LORENZO FINISHES THE NUMBER. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM, LIEBKIND AND DE BRIS.  THEY ARE STUNNED.  BIALYSTOCK IS THE FIRST TO RECOVER. 
BIALYSTOCK (shouting) That's our Hitler! 
LIEBKIND (howls of despair) Vaaaat??? 
BIALYSTOCK (quickly) Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time. 
LIEBKIND But he has long hair! 
BIALYSTOCK Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory. 
LIEBKIND I don't know.  I don't know. 
DE BRIS (he has been studying LSD intensely) Could be an exciting piece of off- beat casting.  Of course, we'd have to do something about that coiffure. 
LIEBKIND But he's so crazy, he's so sloppy, he's so... so... American! 
BIALYSTOCK Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down. 
LIEBKIND All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you. 
DISSOLVE TO MARQUEE OF BROADWAY THEATRE.  MARQUEE READS: OPENING TONIGHT - SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.  Directed by ROGER DE BRIS. 
PAN DOWN TO THEATRE ENTRANCE.  THE SIDEWALK IS CHOKED WITH OPENING NIGHTERS, ALL AGLITTER IN DIAMONDS, FURS AND ELEGANT TUXEDOS.  LUXURIOUS BLACK LIMOUSINES PULL UP TO THE CURB, DEPOSITING THEIR RICH CONTENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE LITTLE OLD LADIES. 
CUT TO LOBBY.  THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SWIRLING CONFUSION STAND BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IN THEIR OPENING NIGHT TAILS. BIALYSTOCK IS RESPLENDENT IN A BLACK SILK CAPE, LINED IN CRIMSON SATIN.  BLOOM'S TAILS ARE OBVIOUSLY RENTED.  THEY ARE NEAR THE TICKET TAKER.  AS SOME OF THE OPENING NIGHT "SUPPORTERS" ENTER THE THEATRE, THEY SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENTS TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  TO EACH OF THE WELL-WISHERS, BIALYSTOCK RESPONDS WITH A SMILE AND A MUMBLE.  THEY GET THE SMILE, WE HEAR THE MUMBLE. 
FIRST WELL-WISHER (a silver-haired gentleman in his late fifties) Good luck, Max, I hope it's a big hit. 
BIALYSTOCK (mumbling) Bite your tongue. 
SECOND WELL-WISHER (a little old lady) We're gonna do it this time, Bialy, I just know it. 
BIALYSTOCK I hope you lose your bloomers. 
THIRD WELL-WISHER (another old lady) My prayers go with you, Bialy. 
BIALYSTOCK God Forbid. 
CUT TO LIMOUSINE PULLING UP IN FRONT OF THEATRE.  DOORMAN OPENS DOOR, ASSISTS RICH COUPLE OUT OF CAR.  LIMOUSINE PULLS AWAY.  A MOTORCYCLE WITH SIDE-CAR ROARS UP TO FRONT OF THEATRE.  AT THE HANDLEBARS, BEAUTIFULLY DECKED OUT IN TUXEDO AND HIS EVER POPULAR GERMAN HELMET IS FRANZ LIEBKIND. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS LIEBKIND AS HE ENTERS LOBBY.  HE MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE MILLING THRONG TOWARD BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.

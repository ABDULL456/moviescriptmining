In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a message in the boxes. It reads: MENTION MONEY AND I'LL KILL YOU. 
JIM AND KENNY 
Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender then back at Kenny. Understand? 
JIM Did I get it right? 
KENNY Yeah, Jim. You got it right. 
INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DUSK 
Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away. A moment's pause then... 
TOM Jerk. 
CHARLIE Jack-ass. 
A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie. 
TOM Give us a kiss. Come on. 
Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away. 
CHARLIE Get out of here. 
TOM (laughs, beat) You really are a cranky old fart, you know that? 
CHARLIE I'm sorry. 
TOM What was that about? I mean, I'm just sitting here and all of a sudden you go postal on me. 
CHARLIE I don't know, I... It's just this weather. I... I want to get back. 
TOM You know, I really do appreciate what you've done for me. This is a good job. 
CHARLIE No, it's not. It stinks. It's putting your life on the line for someone else's money. 
EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DUSK 
Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water. 
THE ARMORED TRUCK 
Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake. 
INT. TRUCK 
Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water. 
TOM Jesus. Where's the road? 
THEIR POV 
Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of the floodwater. 
CHARLIE It's there. (beat) Somewhere. I hope. (beat) Look, Tom, I don't care what it is you end up doing. 
TOM Oh, God, here we go again. 
CHARLIE This is the last time, I swear. 
Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first. 
HIS POV 
The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they resume. 
CHARLIE (looks at Tom) I just think, whatever it is you do, it's time you did some heavy lifting. 
Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars. 
TOM Stop! 
CHARLIE No, you gotta hear this. You're better than -- 
TOM Stop the truck! We're going down! 
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 
The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down. 
INSIDE THE TRUCK 
CHARLIE Jesus! 
Charlie stands on the brakes. 
THEIR POV 
A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield. 
TOM Back up! 
Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving backwards. 
Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's nothing. 
OUTSIDE THE TRUCK 
It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road. 
The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted sign. 
CLOSE ON SIGN 
WELCOME TO HUNTINGBURG.

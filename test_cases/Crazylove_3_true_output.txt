LETTY I don't think so. 
PAUL Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off. 
LETTY Yeah. 
PAUL You just need to get more organized. L 
LETTY Maybe. 
PAUL Let's make a list of the things you need to do, OK? 
Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his briefcase. 
INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT 
MR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and tighter. 
MRS. ANDERSON So at home, we've started our own little library for Chandra. 
MR. ANDERSON We thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card-catalogue. 
LETTY I see. 
Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her hair. 
MRS. ANDERSON But what I'm wondering is whether we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home. What do you think? 
LETTY Well... 
MR. ANDERSON Because we don't want her to get behind her classmates. 
MRS. ANDERSON And we trust your opinion. Chandra's always talking about Miss Mayer. 
LETTY Oh. 
MR. ANDERSON Just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose. 
MRS. ANDERSON And she went on and on about the collage. That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer. 
Letty stares blankly at the couple. 
MR. ANDERSON Miss Mayer? 
LETTY What the fuck. It's my job. 
Off Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we

INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her. 
INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY 
The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots of signs announcing "Sale Day." Frenzied women pick through dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background. 
Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries. 
CLERK More coffee? 
LETTY Hit me. 
CLERK Danish? 
LETTY (rooting through the tray) No more bear claws left? 
Ruth bounces into the shop. 
CLERK (to Ruth) Danish? 
RUTH Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to eat. 
The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns. 
RUTH (to Letty) Where's Mommy? 
LETTY Do you have to call her Mommy? 
RUTH Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy? 
LETTY She said she'd be here at 10. 
Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up. 
RUTH What do you think of this one? 
LETTY I'd have to see it on.

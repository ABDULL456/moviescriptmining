BENDER Totally? 
ANDREW Totally! 
CLAIRE (to Bender) Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody here is interested! 
ANDREW Really! (to Claire about Bender) Buttface! 
BENDER Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to get in here?  Forget to wash your jock? 
BRIAN (nervous) Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we should just write our papers... 
ANDREW (to Bender) Look, just because you live in here doesn't give you the right to be a pain in the ass...so knock it off! 
Bender mockingly registers pain in his face. 
BENDER It's a free country... 
CLAIRE (to Andrew) He's just doing it to get a rise out of you!  Just ignore him... 
BENDER (to Claire) Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if you tried! 
Claire rolls her eyes. 
BENDER So...so! (to Andrew and Claire) Are you guys like boyfriend/girl- friend? (a beat) Steady dates? (another beat) Lo--vers? (another beat) Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do you slip her the hot...beef... injection? 
Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious. 
CLAIRE (screams) Go to hell! 
ANDREW (screams) Enough! 
CUT TO: 
7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY 
We see Vernon in his office. 
VERNON (yells) Hey!  What's going on in there? (to himself) Smug little pricks! CUT TO: 
8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from Bender. 
ANDREW (to himself) Scumbag! 
Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits on it. 
BENDER What do you say we close that door. We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds. 
BRIAN Well, you know the door's s'posed to stay open... 
BENDER So what? 
ANDREW So why don't you just shut up! There's four other people in here you know... 
BENDER God, you can count.  See!  I knew you had to be smart to be a...a wrestler. 
ANDREW Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway?

{"train": "CRANK \nWritten by \nMark Neveldine & Brian Taylor \nFebruary 20, 2005 \nFADE IN: VIDEO SCREEN EXTREME CU: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a yellow ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it's lo-res glory. The camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor, gobbling dots. 2                                                            CUT TO: \nEXTREME CU: A RED GHOST follows, in hot pursuit. CUT TO: \nEXTREME CU: PACMAN gives it the slip, cuts down and gobbles a big dot. CUT TO: \nEXTREME CU: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST, changes direction and runs. PACMAN chases ... P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely escapes. CUT TO: \nPACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in. \nThe sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ... CUT TO BLACK. \nSOUND: A HEART BEATS SLOWLY IN THE DARK. FADE IN: \nINT CHEV'S BEDROOM, MORNING                                        2 \nThis scene plays out as a continuous POV shot, right up until CHEV's face is revealed for the first time.) CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL PHONE, groggy, vision doubled ... \n1    .. from his POV we see him examine his hands, which don't feel right, don't want to move right. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe CELL PHONE, coming from some other room, plays the PACMAN theme in beeps: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM ... \nHe tries to get out of bed, HITS THE GROUND. Plush rug, ultra modern bed frame, night stand, high tech stereo, the works. \nHe crawls/stumbles into ... \nINT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS ... the living room, decked out by Kostabi paintings and glass furniture then into... \nINT CHELIOS KITCHEN, CONTINUOUS                                    4 ... the kitchen, with a black marble island and hanging copper. \nHe jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water. He steadies himself against the matching black marble counter, staring at his hands ... \n.. tries to lift them and BANG!    He's back on the floor, stunned... \nAll the while we hear the faint sound of his HEARTBEAT... \n... slow: LUBDUB... LUBDUB... LUBDUB. \nHe begins crawling back into... \nINT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS \n... the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a plain black VHS tape propped up in front of a plasma screen TV with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like a present. \nCHELIOS (barely comprehensible) Whathufuck? \nHe grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the VCR and pushes PLAY. \nINT.   TV SCREEN 5A                                                                  5A It's RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young, irritatingly slick EASTERN EURO ... little to no accent - fast talking, sarcastic, a complete dick ... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight filters in through the blinds.   There are HOODS loitering around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before. The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue - the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.) \nVERONA What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd give you the heads up. You're dead. \nOn the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA. \nVERONA (CONT'D) Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me... \nWe stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it. \nVERONA (CONT'D) ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it... \nCut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5 on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still don't see his face clearly. \nVERONA (CONT'D) 5A                                                                     5A ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself... \nCut back to CHEV'S POV. He holds his head down over the               5 carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, GAGGING. \nVERONA (CONT'D) \nLet me guess, you're trying to puke the shit out, right? Right? Don't bother... (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nN \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV S hit! \nHe clicks off the cell.       His eyes try to focus on the road. \nOTE: Through it all, the low beating of the heart - from slow to fast - sometimes barely audible, sometimes mixed way out front - clues us into the state of his adrenaline. \nHe grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Come on ... \nANSWERING SERVICE (O.S.) Doctor Miles' office, may I help you? \nCHEV Let me talk to him. \nSPLIT SCREEN WITH: \nINT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS CHOCOLATE, a too-skinny, cracked-out BLACK CHICK, sits in front of a multi-line phone in a broken down apartment. She's wearing a headset. She takes a long drag off her cigarette. \nHOCOLATE (a generic imitation of politeness) I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take - \nCHEV Where is he? \nCHOCOLATE I beg your pardon sir? \nCHEV Where - thefuck - is - he? \nIn more SCREENS WITHIN SCREENS we see a 'WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS' sign, then DOCTOR MILES reclining on a massage table with a bunch of HOOKERS.) \nCHOCOLATE I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged? \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV (exasperated) Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that?     C HOCOLATE Can you spell that for me sir? \nShe searches the food and carton strewn tabletop for something to write with. \nCHEV D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it? \nCHOCOLATE Yes sir... \nCHEV Thank you. \nHEV hangs up. \nCHEV finds himself nodding off in the car ... \nThe CAMERA ZOOMS back into his chest. This time it becomes COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - we see his HEART BEAT SLOW DOWN: \nSOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB... \nThe CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP - \nSOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..! \n... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems to come to his senses. \nCHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up. \nKAYLO (O.S.) Hello? \nCHEV Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? \nSPLIT SCREEN WITH: \nK \nC \nC \nO \nINT KAYLO'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled back curly hair. The room is unkempt. A woman in a robe shuffles by vaguely in the background, possibly his mother? K AYLO h, what's up Chev? \nCHEV (O.S.) I said, where were you last night? \nIN A SCREEN WITHIN A SCREEN WE SEE HIM DRESSING UP IN DRAG, PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME FREAKY CLUB, ETC. \nINT CHEV'S AUDI - SIMULTANEOUS KAYLO (O.S.) I ... uhh ... \nHEV Yeah, yeah.     You wanna know what I was doing? \nCHEV ... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!! \nThe DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS crowd into the tiny room. \notal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming. The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence. \nFinally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice. \nORLANDO THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS COOL! S ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping. \nORLANDO (CONT'D) (calmly) Can we all just get along?   Can we? \nBeat.   CHEV'S gun is still trained on ORLANDO'S head. \nORLANDO (CONT'D) Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make? \nCHEV Where's Verona. \nORLANDO OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona. \nCHEV (starting to lose it again) You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ... \nHe presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the situation is close to blowing up again. \n(CONTINUED) \nT \nC \nCONTINUED: (3) \nORLANDO Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity? \nHEV is running out of patience. \nORLANDO (CONT'D) Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not \"pull the Anselmo job together.\" In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars. \nCHEV That's not how I heard it. \nORLANDO But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. S tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating. \nhen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop. \nCHEV Alright. \nThe room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit away, crazy bitch ass mother ... \nORLANDO Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility. \nLUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB \nCHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds him up and shoves him away. \nORLANDO (CONT'D) Shit dude, what's the matter with you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nCHEV Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ... \nORLANDO I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us. \nHe takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room. \nORLANDO (CONT'D) Now what can I do to help you? \nCHEV Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You got any coke? \nORLANDO gives him the look. \nORLANDO OK, now you're insulting me. \nCHEV Come on, man, I know you got coke. \nORLANDO You think every brother is carrying, is that it? \nCHEV Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ... \nORLANDO I can see that. \nCHEV No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... (losing it again) May I just have some coke, please? \nORLANDO So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me. \nCHEV That's right. \nBeat. \nORLANDO What? \nCHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then, without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins. O RLANDO (CONT'D) There he goes again. \nCHEV has a pool cue in his hands.   He moves out into the hallway, eyes wild. \nOUND: CHEV's HEARTBEAT starts to rev up. \nCHEV Alright ... who wants white meat? \nAll hell breaks loose. \nEXT OUTSIDE THE BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it, single door closed. \nSUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk. \nA second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down. \nSTILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22 HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A JACKHAMMER. INT CHEV'S CAR, MOMENTS LATER Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating hard, panting with adrenaline. \nOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. \nCHEV'S cell rings.   He picks it right up. \nCHEV Doc? \nC \nC \nY \nD \n2               H \nIN A SPLIT SCREEN WE SEE IT'S VERONA. VERONA ey, what's up, Doc! \nCHEV 3A                                                                 23A You motherfucker! \nVERONA ude, aren't you dead yet?    What the hell are you doing out there? \nCHEV 23A                                                                 23A I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me. \nVERONA eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you... \nCHEV 23A                                                                 23A Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history. \nCHEV checks the rearview mirror. \nCHEV (CONT'D) (under his breath) Great. \nThroughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, 23B 23B more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to \"PULL OVER\" out of its intercom. \nHEV goes evasive, leading the cop on a HIGH SPEED CHASE. \nVERONA arlito? That's funny, I guess you didn't know... Carlito's my boy now, we're tight. \nCHEV You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in 3rd grade. \n(CONTINUED) \nD \nC \nC \nC \nCONTINUED: \nVERONA lever. Snappy. Did you pretty good, didn't I, Chelios? Come on, you can admit it. \nCHEV We'll see. \nVERONA Right, right, and the best part about it is... \nCHEV'S phone BEEPS - incoming call. \nHEV Sorry, I must take this. See you later. \nVERONA I doubt it. C HEV pushes \"answer\" and picks up the new call. \nCHEV 25A                                                                    25A Yeah. \nDOC MILES (V.O.) \nDoc Miles. \nCHEV Yo!   Right here! \nCUT TO: \nINT CAB, SECONDS LATER \nThe inside of the cab has the East Indian vibe. Incense, Koran on the dash, and Farsi music over the radio. \nCHEV Go. \nCABBIE (in a thick Pakistani accent) Where we go? \nCHEV Straight.    Now. \nThey zip through the stop sign and hit the traffic light. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Make a right. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY 30   T                                                                    30 he CABBIE pulls a CALIFORNIA ROLLER to the right - the TIRES PEEL. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nCONTINUED: \nThree SQUAD CARS pass, SIRENS AND LIGHTS BLARING, heading the0A 30A                                                               3 opposite way. \nCHEV starts to drop off; we hear his HEART RATE start to slow9A 29A                                                               2 down. \nCHEV ey, crank the music. \nThe CABBIE turns to an FM country station playing Billy Ray Cyrus, \"Achy Breaky Heart.\" \nCHEV (CONT'D) No, CRANK IT. \nThe Cabbie BLARES it. \nCHEV starts to embarrassingly bang his head to the Billy Ray as if it was Metallica in the late 80's. \nSomething catches his eye. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Pull over.     Come on, right here.    Thank you. \nA 7-11 can be seen through the side window. \nCHEV (CONT'D) OK, I'll be back in one minute.       Don't go anywhere. \nCABBIE OK, cowboy. \nEXT 7-11 STREET, SECONDS LATER CHEV jumps out of the cab and into the 7-11.         We see him pull his gun from his pants as he enters. \nINT 7-11 CONVENIENCE STORE, CONTINUOUS He goes right to the counter and sticks the place up. \nHe grabs the man from behind the counter and in one move, yanks him over the counter and SLAMS HIM FACE-DOWN on the floor. \nCHEV You move, you die ... \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nO \nH \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV grabs a box of trash bags, rips it open and takes one out. He opens the bag and starts dumping CAFFEINE in: Jolt, Coke, Red Bull, Starbucks Frappuccinos. \ne DIALS A NUMBER on W his cell.    It rings twice, then: \nOMAN (V.O.) Hey, this is Eve ... \nCHEV AHHHHHHHHHH! \nHe yells and jumps up and down while heading to the counter. He grabs hundreds of the little ginseng capsules, Vivran, and everything candy. The bag's full. \nne last look. He spots some shitty flowers in a bucket. The fastest double take in movie history with the grouchiest face, then he grabs them. \nCUT TO: \nINT CAB, SECONDS LATER He hops back in the cab with the cheap flowers and the black santa bag. \nHe opens the bag and starts SLAMMING whatever he can get his hands on. \nCABBIE Where you want to go, man? \nCHEV is guzzling Red Bull, popping vitamins, whatever. \nCUT TO legs treading. \nCHEV (CONT'D) What is this? Are you boys now or something? \nCARLITO Verona? That's just a small time punk. But... that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here. \nCHEV Opportunity. \nCARLITO Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev. Maybe this can even the score for the Don Kim hit, which was perhaps ill- advised. \nCHEV (flabbergasted) Ill advised? \nCARLITO The heat from Hong Kong has been more than we anticipated. \nCHEV Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some use to you. \nCARLITO Don't be difficult. \nCHEV Am I being difficult? Is this what you call difficult? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm having a DIFFICULT FUCKING DAY, BRO! \nBeat. \nCARLITO re you disrespecting me, Chev?    Is that what you're doing? \nThey stare each other down. \nLUBDUB ... LUB ... DUB ... LUB ... DUB ... \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nF \nCONTINUED: (4) \nCHEV orget it, I'm out of here. \nCHEV climbs out of the pool. CARLITO NARROWS HIS EYES, watching him leave. The BODYGUARD motions to follow, CARLITO signals him off. CHEV passes a black HELICOPTER sitting on a small, hard-rubbered heli-pad. \nCARLITO'S POV - from a distance we see CHEV knocking over furniture and BREAKING GLASS on his way out. \nCARLITO'S POV descends beneath the water - his breath releases. \nCUT TO: \nEXT STREET, IN FRONT OF CARLITO'S BUILDING, MOMENTS LATER The building opens onto the high rent section of Sunset Blvd. An outdoor cafe populated by the rich and trendy is next C door. \nHEV shakes himself off and bangs out of the revolving glass doors. A VALET approaches him and CHEV gets in his face, FLASHING MURDEROUS TEETH and shoving him away, hopping up and down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab waiting out front. \nThe same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside. \nCABBIE You're not getting into my cab wet. \nCHEV I just gave you 200 dollars to wait for 3 minutes. \nCABBIE You are not getting into my car no way. \nCHEV goes to the driver side of the car, pulls the CABBIE out of the cab and tosses him into the road. The lunch crowd at the cafe, passerbys, etc., look on in bewilderment. CHEV points at the CABBIE and starts screaming ... \nHEV AL QEADA!   AL QEADA! \nEverybody freaks out. A WAITER dives under the a table, expecting an explosion. \nCHEV grabs the CABBIE by his lapels and tosses him right into the CAFE, smashing a table, still pointing and screaming. \n(CONTINUED) \nE \nD \nC \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV (CONT'D) AL QEADA! T he whole restaurant, OLD LADIES included, dogpile the poor CABBIE, wildly protesting in a thick accent. \nCABBIE I love America! I love Bush! \nCHEV gets in the cab and drives off. \nCUT TO: \nINT CAB, MOMENTS LATER CHEV is slamming Frappucinos, driving. \nSOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. \nIt's the CELL PHONE. \nEXT. TACO STAND, DAY KAYLO pays for his food at a leisurely pace - he's at a little place across the street from CHARLIE O'S - and skulks out onto the street, trying too hard to be inconspicuous. \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY Meanwhile, in the second screen, CHEV is blasting along at high speed, off the freeway, through downtown, and right to the corner of 3rd and Flower, where he leaves the taxi idling in a red zone and gets out. \nAs KAYLO turns the corner, the two SPLIT SCREENS meet up - he45 and CHEV run right into each other. \nHEV pulls KAYLO around the corner, out of sight of the restaurant. \nCHEV motioning to the restaurant) He's in there now? \nKAYLO nods quickly, freaked out. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Did anyone go in with him? \nKAYLO shakes his head NO. \nCHEV (CONT'D) A lright, wait here. \nThe CAMERA stays with CHEV as he walks right across the street and up to the restaurant. \nINT CHARLIE O'S, SAME TIME ALEX is in his usual booth, making lecherous smalltalk with a 40ish WAITRESS in a short skirt and fishnet stockings, as CHEV, still drying, hair all fucked up and walking erratically, enters the restaurant. Everyone turns to look at the crazy man, nervously. \nHEV walks doggedly right by ALEX, staring straight ahead, not letting on that he knows he's there. ALEX watches him pass in disbelief. \nWAITRESS What was that? \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nB \nCONTINUED: \nALEX I just saw a ghost. \nCHEV disappears through the swinging doors to the kitchen. The MAIRTRE'D has the phone in his hands, ready to dial the cops, but ALEX motions to him to chill. He'll take care of it. \nHe gets up and follows in CHEV'S footsteps. \nINT CHARLIE O'S KITCHEN, SAME TIME ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they want no part of this. CHEV is nowhere to be seen. A LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life - drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes. \nHe passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous BUTCHER KNIFE. \nTurning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly closed. He advances. \nThe back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and tries to peer around it into the alley. \nJust then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the BUTCHER KNIFE. \nefore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and into the alley. \nEXT ALLEY, SAME TIME ALEX crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the alley, brandishing the BUTCHER KNIFE, heartrate slamming. \nCHEV How you like that one, tough guy? How freaking awesome was that? \ne kicks him in the ribs, knocking him over. \nCHEV (CONT'D) You feel like talking to me?   Where's your brother? \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nCONTINUED: \nALEX (anger gradually overcoming the shock) Doing your mother like an Iraqi prisoner, you bitch. \nCHEV Nice ... wonder how many steaks I could get out of you ... A LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and lands on him with his full weight. \nCHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ... \n... until KAYLO appears behind ALEX with a ROLLING PIN and brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK. \nALEX rises up, staggering, and advances on KAYLO, who drops the ROLLING PIN and cowers amidst the trash cans. \nCHEV gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back of ALEX'S head. \nCHEV pulls the trigger twice. \nCLICK. CLICK. \nCHEV (CONT'D) WHAT?? \nHe tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the restaurant as ALEX proceeds to beat KAYLO down with a trashcan, swinging it one handed. \nHEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He uses ALEX'S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Jesus ... nothing's easy ... \nINT HOSPITAL PHARMACY, MOMENTS LATER CHEV cuts off an OLD MAN with a walker making his way to the counter. He runs his hand through his freaked out hair, trying to straighten it out. The PHARMACIST, a cynical girl, mid-20s, with thick horn rimmed glasses, regards him blankly. \n(CONTINUED) \nP \nP \nCONTINUED: \nOLD MAN Asshole. \nCHEV (to the pharmacist) I'm looking for something ... starts with `E' ... \nPHARMACIST England? \nCHEV That's funny. No, I'm talking about some kind of artificial adrenaline ... some shit ... you know ... \nHARMACIST Artificial adrenaline. \nCHEV I have heart problems. \nPHARMACIST Epinephrine? \nCHEV Yes!    Yes ... that's it ... you have it? \nHARMACIST I can't give you epinephrine. \nCHEV Why? \nPHARMACIST Just a minute. \nShe walks into the back.        Through the glass he sees her pick up a phone. \nCHEV Come on, what is that... \nA pimply faced TEENAGER with greasy, shoulder length brown hair has been watching the whole thing from the magazine rack.                T EENAGER Nasal spray, dude. \nCHEV What? \n(CONTINUED) \nT \nH \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTEENAGER Nasal spray. \ne gestures to a counter display: NAS-ALL, little plastic bottles. \nTEENAGER (CONT'D) It's got epinephrine in it.   Get you tweaked, man. \nCHEV looks from the kid to the display and back, then through the glass window, where the PHARMACIST is talking to someone on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously. \nHe picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him. \nINT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over, trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray, tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering. \nHe rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S direction. They look up toward him. \nHe ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and slips in. \nINT HOSPITAL ROOM, MOMENTS LATER \nThe room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ... \n.. then glances over at the half open closet. \nINT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER The COPS come up on the corridor where CHEV disappeared. They advance, hands on weapons, checking each room. \nhey reach CHEV'S room. The door is slightly ajar.     One of the cops pushes it open with his foot. \nThe OLD MAN is there, motionless.   No sign of CHEV. \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nCONTINUED: \nThe COPS continue down the hall. Behind them, from the door they checked, CHEV tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital johnnie, tied in the back with his ass hanging out, trying to blend in. \nOne of the COPS notices this. \nCOP Hey! \nCHEV takes off, walking faster, around the corner.        The COPS head after him. T he COPS turn the corner.        CHEV is still trying to play it off. \nhe COP jumps off the bike and tries to make a go at him, but jerks back when CHEV catches the gun. CHEV holds the gun up like a fetch stick, gluing the COP'S eyes, then flings it 40 feet through the air to splash into a plaza fountain. \nhe COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle. He kicks up the stand and REVS IT. \nCOP You son of a bitch! \nThe COP makes a dive for CHEV, grabbing him by the waist as the bike jerks forward. \nHEV starts to burn the bike out as the COP hangs on, dragging. SMOKE ERUPTS; black bits of rubber spray like buckshot, pelting the COP. CHEV does a 360 DEGREE BURNOUT, kicking with his leg to keep the bike under control, then jerking, skidding, BLASTS OFF. The COP hangs on, cursing, dragging, boots smoking, for a half block before he bails out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT ROAD, MONTAGE, 30 SECONDS LATER EVERYBODY'S TALKING\" by Harry Nilsson BEGINS. \nCHEV cruises in an out of traffic and people like a Sunday drive, ignoring traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians. (We speed ramp about 20% to the beat of the song - an undercrank of about 18fps.) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe's so jacked up and delusional he decides to try a BARE- ASSED \"ELEVATOR\" ON THE SIDEWALK. \nFrom the rear pegs at about 30 mph he JUMPS UP TO THE GAS TANK, feet first, STANDS STRAIGHT UP ON THE MOVING BIKE and puts his hands out to his sides in a Jesus Christ pose, flashing a silhouette in the sun. His HEART POUNDS as he flies by crowds of astonished bystanders ... \n.. and CRASHES straight into a patio restaurant full of people. \nCHEV flips through the air and lands in a cacophony of overturned tables and busted dishes. A table spins like a coin at his feet. \nEND: \"EVERYBODY'S TALKING\" EXT RESTAURANT, MOMENTS LATER Stunned silence hangs in the air; a few food-covered people wander around in dazed shock. CHEV'S arm, hand still clutching his cell phone, sticks out from under a table. The phone starts to ring: \nBEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. \nFrom under the table we see CHEV'S eyes blink as he comes to his senses. \nHe shakes off the debris, struggles to his feet and clicks to answer the phone. \nCHEV Yeah. \nEVE (O.S.) (sleepy) Hey. Did you try to call? \nCHEV lets his arm drop to his side, stares blankly at nothing, then brings it back up. \nCUT TO: \nINT EVE'S APARTMENT, SAME TIME A room suffused in amber filtered sunlight. EVE, a non- traditionally adorable strawberry blond in her mid 20's, yawn- stretches with the phone cradled between ear and bare shoulder. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nE \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV (O.S.) You've been home all day? \nEVE I was sleeping in. \nCHEV (O.S.) You were sleeping in, that's great, Eve ... super great ... you all rested now? \nVE Yep. \nCUT TO: \nEXT RESTAURANT, SAME TIME 69A                                                                    69A CHEV (holding it together) Well, I'm glad to hear that. Listen, I've been fatally poisoned, there's probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak, but don't bother getting out of bed, I'll be there in a flash ... Maybe you could fry me up a waffle or something, kay? E VE (O.S.) (oblivious) Sure, come on over, I'll be here. \nCHEV Right, you'll be there, OK. \nCHEV clicks off. \nll the while he's been wrestling the wasted motorcycle from the wreckage. It's smoking, leaking oil. \nHe shakes his head at a dumfounded waiter, holding up the phone like - \"Can you believe this?\" ... then climbs on the SPUTTERING BIKE and drives off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. VERONA'S CRIB - DAY CU: VERONA stares straight down at the CAMERA. \nREVERSE: VERONA'S POV - ALEX'S severed hand, frozen stiff in a trigger-pulling position. \n(CONTINUED) \nE \nC \nCONTINUED: \nVERONA looks up at his CREW, gathered nervously around the room; lunatic schizo-cycles through a half dozen emotions before arriving at something resembling off-hand, casual, I'll have the #2 Super Size with a Diet Coke. \nConfused, she pads off to the bedroom to change. \nCHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window, looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up and punches two buttons. \nEXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18- wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral. \nHEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nS \nC \nCONTINUED: (3) \nWe hear his HEART skip, hang for a long moment, then thud again, heavily. \nHEV (to himself) That shit's wearing off ... \nEVE (O.S.) (calling to him) Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on if you want to make one. \nCHEV (calling back) Great, great ... \nHe lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting to smoke. \nHe takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND PRESSES THE THING CLOSED. \nOUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE. \ne screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping up and down. \nEVE (O.S.) You're so stressed out, do you want some pot? \nCHEV (fighting to get the words out) Yes. No! ... thanks ... \nThe waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a ribbon in her hair. \nEVE What's the matter? \nCHEV (holding it in) Nothing ... burned my hand ... \nShe comes up to him, tries to pry his hand out from under his arm.                 E VE Oh my God, are you OK?   Let me see... \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nCONTINUED: (4) \nCHEV It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ... \nEVE Come on, let me see ... \nCHEV I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!! \nEVE (coldly) That was just totally uncalled for. \nCHEV (exasperated) I'm sorry ... look, can we just ... \nEVE Fine. \nShe turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a huff. \nHEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better look. \nA SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're PACKING. \nBACK TO: \nCHEV (under his breath) Shit! \nHe flies out the door after EVE - the door swings shut behind him. \nINT. HALLWAY, EVE'S BUILDING - DAY CHEV comes up behind EVE, grabs her by the shoulders and turns her around. \nCHEV I'm parked out back. \n(CONTINUED) \nE \nS \nCONTINUED: \nHe glances over his shoulder. Through the glass SECURITY DOOR he sees HOOD #1 coming up the front steps. \nINT. SENIOR CITIZEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS A PARAKEET in a cage by the window disappears in a puff of feathers. \nEXT. REAR EXIT, EVE'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nFrom overhead, the CAMERA CORKSCREWS CLOCKWISE as CHEV wrenches the HOOD'S neck COUNTERCLOCKWISE, snapping it. \nEVE You know, I could use a little help here. \nCHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely. \nCHEV Is this yours? \nEVE rolls her eyes, looks around. \nEVE Where's your car? \n(CONTINUED) \nW \nF \nCONTINUED: \nCHEV My car. Actually... I took a cab. \nEXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - DAY A POLICE MOTORCYCLE is tipped over on a lawn, coughing up black smoke, spewing oil. A crowd of Mexicans are gathered around, gaping. \nlames start to SHOOT UP from the motorcycle; THE CROWD SCATTERS, ducking for cover. \nEXT L.A. CHINATOWN, 8 MINUTES LATER MONTAGE: Chinatown is bustling with activity. Vendors haggle ... workers hustle down the sidewalk with baskets of chickens, sides of meat ... tourists wander ... motorists argue and punch their horns ... and the lunch hour crowd converges on a hundred eateries ... \ne hear a million HEARTBEATS, old, young ... even fast ticking chicken heartbeats, all overlapping, blending together in a swelling din of live things. \nThe voyeuristic CAMERA picks CHEV and EVE up through the crowd. CHEV is wearing DARK GLASSES to go with his 80's hair E and jogger. \nVE You're embarrassing. \nCHEV You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ... \nEVE Hm.   So why are we here? \nINT NOODLE HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally tiny VIETNAMESE WOMAN brings them menus. \nCHEV pulls a little bottle of NAS-ALL out of his pocket and SNORTS the entire thing, grotesquely, at the table. It doesn't help much. \nHe shakes out his head, bangs his fist on the table and sits up in his chair. \nCHEV (holding his fingers up to indicate quotation marks) (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nC \nC \nC \nCONTINUED:             CHEV(CONT'D) \"This isn't going to be easy\" ... as they say ... \nEVE flinches at the sight of his burned, waffle patterned palm. He notices, draws it back. \nCHEV (CONT'D) Alright, here it is. I told you I was a video game programmer. That was a lie. Actually... \nUT TO: \nINT THOUSAND CRANES, KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nCHEV'S DIALOG continues over the FLASHBACK. \nCHEV is retrieving a HIDDEN GUN from the kitchen, checking the CLIP, the BARREL, the ACTION, and slipping out a side door into a RED CORRIDOR past two CHINESE MEN in black suits. \nCHEV (V.O.) I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate. \nCUT TO: \nINT THOUSAND CRANES, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nDON KIM sits at the head of the table, drinking alone. \nCHEV (V.O.) Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special. \nCHEV walks up behind him, gun drawn to the back of KIM'S head... cocks the hammer back. DON KIM spins around in shock, the same reaction we saw in the SCENE 1 FLASHBACK - FROZEN, SAUCER-EYED. \nHEV'S eyes steel... his finger tightens... \nHEV (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... S ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON KIM'S head, paralyzed with indecision. \nDON KIM Well? What are you waiting for? \n(CONTINUED) \nCHEV (getting a desperate idea) Wait a minute. Do you trust me? \nEVE No. \nCHEV Make love to me. \nEVE What? \nCHEV Come on. I think it'll help. \nEVE Help what? \nHe starts grabbing at her.       She pushes his hands away. \nEVE (CONT'D) Get off!   Are you kidding me? \nCHEV Take your clothes off. \nEVE No! \nCHEV You always say you want to be more spontaneous. E VE You're insane. You're like some adrenaline junkie with no soul. \nCHEV Save me, Eve. Save my life. \n(CONTINUED) \nE \nN \nT \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCHEV starts feeling up EVE'S ass. \nEVE Stop it! \nShe SLUGS HIM IN THE MOUTH.    His head snaps back; he comes up holding his lip. \nEVE (CONT'D) Oh my God, Chev! \nShe reaches instinctively to comfort him and he lunges forward, tearing at her dress. \nhey roll around on the ground, scratching and clawing at one another. A curious crowd gathers round. EVE starts to flip out, SCREAMING AND POUNDING on him with her fists like a crazy woman. \next thing you know she's kissing and biting his mouth, breathless, still pounding with her fists. \nEVE (CONT'D) You filthy animal ... \nShe reaches down and starts fumbling with his pants. He helps. The onlookers' eyes widen, moms covering the kids' faces. \nEVE (CONT'D) Take me right here in front of everyone. \nCHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to pick up. He lifts her dress and positions himself on top of her. EVE is completely out of her head, eyes closed, legs up in the air like a porn star. E VE (CONT'D) That's it... do it ... \nCHEV thrusts. \nVE (CONT'D) Come on, put it in me... \nHe thrusts again.    EVE's eyes pop open. \nEVE (CONT'D) What are you waiting for? \nCHEV looks down at his equipment, then up at EVE, helplessly. \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nW \nA \nCONTINUED: (3) \nEVE (CONT'D) (incredulously) Tell me you're joking.    Now you can't get it up? \nCHEV (determined) I'll fucking get it up! \nWith a surge of energy he lifts her off the ground, drags her over to a newspaper machine on the street - the crowd parts to let them through - and bends her over it. \nHe tries again to enter her. \nEVE God damn it, Chev ...! \nCHEV Shut up! \nHe starts to SPANK her. She responds with a moan. A certain portion of the crowd spontaneously breaks into applause. CHEV picks up the pace. EVE begins making primal cries. \nEVE No. Chev. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. \nCHEV spots a flash of blue - COPS making their way through the crowd. \nCHEV hit! \nHe breaks away running, leaving EVE stranded half naked in the street, holding her torn dress up amidst a sea of gaping Chinese. \nEVE (screaming after him) YOU'LL BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!!! \nCHEV (shouting back, voice trailing off) I'll call you! \nINT CHINATOWN CAB, 5 MINUTES LATER \nCHEV sits in the back, fading. \nLUB ... DUB ... LUBBBB ... \nHAITIAN CABBIE, 30's, in a sleeveless black mesh T-shirt. \nHAITIAN CABBIE (heavy accent) Hey. \ne adjusts the mirror to get a look at CHEV.   CHEV looks like hell - cold sweat, woozy, glass-eyed. \nHAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) Hey man. What's the matter with you? You a crackhead? \nCHEV Right... just step on it, alright? \n(CONTINUED) \nC \nH \nCONTINUED: \nHAITIAN CABBIE Hey, you not gonna die in my cab, crackhead. \nThe HAITIAN CABBIE opens up his glove compartment and takes something out. CHEV'S eyes widen. A gun? \nHAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) I got something for you. \nAs the CABBIE turns around CHEV experiences a FLASH HALLUCINATION: \nThe CABBIE'S face is painted like a PSYCHEDELIC VOODOO SKULL in GLOWING BLACK LIGHT PAINT. He is grinning crazily. \nCHEV flinches in horror, but just like that the CABBIE is back to normal. He hands CHEV a vial of liquid. \nHAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) You drink this Haitian shit, crackhead. This right here is some hardcore shit. Made from plant shit. \nCHEV (laughing) Nice. \nHAITIAN CABBIE (irritated) What are you laughing at? Look at this! \nHe flexes a HUGE BICEP. \nAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) You see that? That's what a man looks like, crackhead. That's the power. Now look at you. \nHEV narrows his eyes at the CABBIE, then shakes his head. \nCHEV What the hell. \nHe twists open the little vial and downs it in one gulp. \nCHEV (CONT'D) grimacing) Tastes like ass. \nHAITIAN CABBIE That's right, devil. You wait. \n(CONTINUED) \nT \nL \nT \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCHEV rolls his eyes and leans against the door, face pressed against the window glass. \nraffic flashes by at high speed then cuts to slo mo: The CAMERA ramps down to 120 f.p.s as a car rolls by CHEV'S taxi. A LITTLE BOY who could be younger version of CHEV himself rides in the back seat. They make eye contact as the cars cross paths. \nCHEV finds himself drifting into a dream state. \nFLASH CUT TO: \nINT CAB, TIME UNKNOWN 92   C                                                              92 HEV'S eyes are glazed, staring through the window. \nHe notices something strange in the CAB'S rear view mirror - something RED. \nC \nEXT ROOF, SECONDS LATER CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's, stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV - holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and gun sit on the ledge beside him. \nWe recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the men loitering around the pool. \nCHEV sneaks up. \nHOOD #2 How the hell should I know? He went in where they load the boxes. Alright, alright ... H e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin. \nCHEV (sarcastically) Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too? \nHOOD #2 Chevy!   Shit! \nHEV What the fuck is this, you working for the Chinese now? \nHOOD #2 The Chinese... are you crazy? \nCHEV Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo? \nHOOD #2 Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ... \nCHEV (losing his patience) OK, ding, time's up ... \nIn one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs, hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, then turns and heads for the roof access door ... \n(CONTINUED) \nL \nC \nH \nH \nH \nCONTINUED: \nHOOD #2 (O.S.)

We recognize this as the room KAYLO called from ... more so because his LIMP BODY is still duct taped to the rolling office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the room. A half dozen more HOODS are gathered in front of the freight elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by surprise. \ne's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE. \nCHEV Alright, where is that motherfucker? \nThe HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away from CHEV, spreading out. \nOOD #3 Uh ... hey, Chev. \nThe HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows each other. \nCHEV What the fuck is this? \nOOD #1 Chevy, baby, take it easy. \nCHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their guns at him. \nHEV ike this? WHERE'S VERONA? \nHOOD #1 Verona got nothing to do with this. \nCHEV What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHOOD #1 Don Carlos wants you off the street. \nCHEV (stunned) Carlito? \nHOOD #1 You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. \nCHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief. \nCHEV Carlito ordered this? \nHOOD #1 (ignoring it) Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die. \nCHEV Just die. \nHOOD #1 Yeah.   Just ... die. \nCHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other HOODS ... \nCONTINUED: \nShe freezes - one of the DEAD HOODS lands with a THUD in the spot she would've been - \nCHEV (CONT'D) ... OK, now come on. \nEVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs her hand and yanks her along. \nHe spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND RICOCHET off the pavement. \nEVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS. \nEVE Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill. \nCHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out onto the ground. \no keys. \nCHEV here's the keys? E VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along. \nCHEV (CONT'D) (taking them) Cool. \nEVE My stuff... \nShe looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW of the car. \nCHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT. \nINT.

Yeah, that's true too. \ne SLAMS his fist against the wheel. \nEVE (cracking) Then... that means... \nCHEV Pretty much. \nEVE How can we stop it? \nCHEV Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down. \nVE (getting it) So... when we were in Chinatown...? \nCHEV Yeah. Sorry. \nA LOOK OF DETERMINATION comes over her. She reaches for his crotch. \nCHEV (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nEVE his will get you going. \n(CONTINUED) \nE \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCHEV WHAT? \nEVE Come on, let's finish what you started. \nCHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP - just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out the front. \nEVE'S head STAYS DOWN. \nCHEV Oh boy... \nVERONA Oh, the antidote, huh? \nVERONA makes eye contact with his CREW, covering the mouthpiece of the phone; they all try to keep from breaking up. \nCHEV That's right. \nVERONA And what are you prepared to give me. Asshole. \nCHEV How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker? \nThis stings VERONA. He pulls the phone away from his face, looks at it like he wants to smash it into bits, then pulls himself together and puts it back to his ear. \nVERONA (holding back, tight lipped) Hmmm. \nCHEV Thinking about it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nVERONA pantomimes jacking off for the boys. \nVERONA Alright. \nCHEV You like that deal? \nVERONA Whatever. \nCHEV I'll be at Downtown Standard in twenty minutes.

VERONA takes a deep breath, then speed dials a number on the cell phone. V ERONA (CONT'D) Verona.

It's going to be alright, baby. \nTHEN: \nE \nEXT LOS ANGELES, DAY From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV walking toward the CAMERA in slow motion, 100 f.p.s. \nDialog from an UNSEEN CONVERSATION is layered over the image. \nEVE (O.C.) But... you said... \nCHEV (O.C.) I know. But things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone. \nHe's well dressed in a sportcoat, slacks, button down shirt and tie, flapping in the wind ... sunglasses, and look of brutal determination on his face ... \nVE (O.C.) I'm scared. \nCHEV (O.C.) Of course. But you'll be safe now.

He's got an ASIAN GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking, silenced   GLOCK .9mm. \nMore ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes are dead-blank COLD AS HELL. V ERONA What... you... he... \nCHEV Presto. \nOne of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. \nCARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets... \nVERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV... \nummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap... \ne snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS...

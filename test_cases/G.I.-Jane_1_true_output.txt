INSTRUCTOR JOHNS You're wanted at the C.O.'s. 
INT.  C.O.'S OUTER OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
Jordan enters.  The yeoman's desk is unattended.  Noticing the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find... 
Blondell.  She looks scared out of her mind.  Before she and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes. 
YEOMAN This way, lieutenant.  They're expecting you. 
INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
JORDAN See me, sir? 
The C.O. and X.O. are both here. 
C.O. (uncomfortable) I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were... (reading) "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming." 
JORDAN (a beat,laughing in relief) Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong. 
The C.O.'s face remains grim.  He isn't relieved. 
JORDAN They're very wrong.  And I'd like to know where you got this information. 
On the C.O.'s nod, the X.O. opens an adjoining office. Wickwire enters.  He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake. 
WICKWIRE I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. 
JORDAN This is insane.  You've got no proof. 
X.O. (from report) You were seen leaving Ensign Blondell's apartment at approximately 0-200, whereupon physical affections were exchanged in public. 
JORDAN We hugged. 
X.O. In addition, you have been seen frequenting the base exchange, the mess hall, the -- 
JORDAN Because the men didn't want me eating with them.  Jesus Christ, let's get this right. 
C.O. That's enough.  Everybody. (to Wickwire) Rejoin your class, lieutenant. 
WICKWIRE (only to Jordan) I wish I didn't have to do this, Jordan. 
C.O. Dismissed, lieutenant. 
Wickwire exits. 
JORDAN Sir, I just want you to know that this is either a gross mistake -- or someone's vindictive bullshit. In no way did anything happen between Ensign Blondell and myself. We're just friends. 
X.O. So you're saying the charges have no validity whatsoever? 
Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates, realizing where this might be headed.  What the collateral damage might be. 
JORDAN I'm saying, we're just friends. 
C.O. I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself. 
JORDAN Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud... 
C.O. I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed. 
Jordan moves to the door.  Again she makes eye-contact with Blondell.  Now we understand why she's so scared: There's a witch-hunt brewing. 
JORDAN (turning back) Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward? 
C.O. I'm not sure what -- 
JORDAN Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there? 
She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the C.O. actually hesitates before answering. 
C.O. I believe so. 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees. They spot Jordan approaching. 
MCCOOL So what'd he want?  O'Neil?

SKAT Idiot. There's a rumor going around that there's a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies. 
MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband. 
JOF And what part am I to play? 
SKAT You're such a damn fool, so you're going to be the Soul of Man. 
JOF That's a bad part, of course. 
SKAT Who makes the decisions around here? Who is the director of this company anyhow? 
SKAT, grinning, holds the mask in front of his face and recites dramatically. 
SKAT Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs by a thread. Your time is short. (in his usual voice) Are the women going to like me in this getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already. 
He stumbles into the wagon muttering furiously. JOF sits, leaning forward. MIA lies beside him on the grass. 
MIA Jof! 
JOF What is it? 
MIA Sit still. Don't move. 
JOF What do you mean? 
MIA Don't say anything. 
JOF I'm as silent as a grave. 
MIA Shh! I love you. 
Waves of heat envelop the gray stone church in a strange white mist. The KNIGHT dismounts and enters. After tying up the horses, JONS slowly follows him in. When he comes onto the church porch he stops in surprise. To the right of the entrance there is a large fresco on the wall, not quite finished. Perched on a crude scaffolding is a PAINTER wearing a red cap and paint-stained clothes. He has one brush in his mouth, while with another in his hand he outlines a small, terrified human face amidst a sea of other faces. 
JONS What is this supposed to represent? 
PAINTER The Dance of Death. 
JONS And that one is Death? 
PAINTER Yes, he dances off with all of them.

ANGELA Jess, they're not actually related. 
JESSICA But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird.. 
ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured. 
JESSICA ... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker. 
ANGELA Maybe he'll adopt me. 
Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter 
EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him. 
BELLA Who's he? 
JESSICA That's Edward Cullen. 
Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems.. confused. Bella quickly looks away. 
JESSICA He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care. 
(she obviously does) Anyway, don't waste your time. 
BELLA I wasn't planning on it. 
But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair. 
16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16 
A room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella and Mike enter. 
Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes 
EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as she passes Edward's table.. 
SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. 
Mr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. 
MR. MOLINA Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught up. 
Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when 
ON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill.. 
Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it, mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. 
MR. MOLINA 
(to the class, animated) 
Today we'll be observing the behavior 
of planaria, a.k.a flatworms. 
As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table 
MR. MOLINA We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms.. 
Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over his nose as if he smells something horrible. 
Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr. Molina hands Edward two petri dishes. 
MR. MOLINA ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die. 
Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. 
She can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure.. 
17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17 
-- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; he's gone. 
18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18 
Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees 
EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 40's. He doesn't see Bella enter. 
EDWARD 
There must be something open sixth 
period. Physics? Biochem? 
ADMINISTRATOR 
No, every class is full. I'm 
afraid you'll have to stay in

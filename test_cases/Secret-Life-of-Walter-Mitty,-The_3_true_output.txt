SEAN What's with all these shoes? 
Angry Middle-easterners are throwing their shoes at Walter and Sean as they sprint by. 
WALTER It's a sign of disdain here. 
SEAN That's a lot of shoes, man. 
WALTER They've been targeting western journalists all summer. It's been a real hot August. 
SEAN Thanks for doing all the field work here and risking your ass and getting hit by shoes and stuff. 
WALTER Let's just get this camera bag out of here. We can shoot the shit later, O'Connell. Over whiskeys. 
There are in Sana'a, Yemen, but they're chasing an actual NYC metro south. Walter has finally reached its doors, though he's continuously struck by shoes. 
INT. 104 BUS, NYC - MOMENTS LATER 
Walter's slightly out of breath. He's caught the bus. It's just New York again. Walter walks up the crowded bus aisle and finds a seat. Some time passes. Walter looks out the window, his daydream has faded. 
INT. 104 BUS, MOVING, NYC - LATER 
A little later, Walter's got his lap top out, trying to leave a "wink" for Cheryl M. (Cheryl Mellhoff) on eHarmony . It doesn't work: unable to perform request. Walter looks at it - it's not the smooth next step he was expecting. He tries again. Same result. 
INT. 104 BUS, MOVING - LATER 
Walter's in the midst of a phone call. 
WALTER I tried to leave a "wink." For someone. But it didn't work. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, they're not required to respond to you favorably. We can't FORCE-- 
WALTER No, it says "unable to perform request," Todd. So I don't think my wink really went through. Do I have like a broken page or something? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Broken page? I've never heard of that. 
WALTER Well, okay, something's not working. On my page. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Yeah, let me look here (KEYBOARD NOISE) Okay, we received your application breaking your personality into 29 different dimensions, and, okay, I see the problem. You don't have any. 
WALTER Any what? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Dimensions. 
Further time passes. 
WALTER ...I don't have any dimensions? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Not that we can determine. Through our models. You're just lacking distinguishing features as our system sees it. Based on our really extensive evaluation, you seem, to us, a little too indistinguishable from everybody else. 
A pretty long time passes as Walter wrestles with this consideration. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D) You're not standing out. In a way that would allow anyone to actually notice you. So hey, let's enhance your profile. Let me ask you, did you always want to be a practical asset manager? 
WALTER I don't want to be one now. I just am one. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Why do you do it? 
WALTER It's an occupation. When I became an adult I thought that would be possibly a good thing to have. Because I keep getting bills from places. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR What are some of your accomplishments? 
WALTER (AFTER THINKING) ...I studied music. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR How long? 
WALTER April. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR April? One April? 
WALTER Yeah. But I was working at Orange Julius to save money for college. That April. And my hands were always sore from working the Frother. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Can you play any pieces? 
WALTER Sure. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Which? 
WALTER A piece of Cheers. The first piece. Part. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR I don't know if we should list that.

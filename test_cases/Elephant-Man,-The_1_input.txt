The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest. 
We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression. 
We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them. 
OUTSIDE THE SHOP 
The Owner is locking up. 
Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus. 
He looks at the garish portrait again. 
Treves produces his purse. 
The Owner, smelling money, turns. 
Treves hands him several coins. 
TREVES So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...? 
OWNER Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there. 
TREVES I'll send a cab. Here is my card. 
Treves hands the Owner a card. The Owner, greasy and dirty, shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm. 
OWNER Now we got a deal... We understand each other... guv. We understand each other completely. 
The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator. 
Treves walks off, disoriented. 
The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away down the street. 
DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP 
A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face. 
There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick. 
The figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view. 
OWNER Don't just stand there. Help him up. 
The Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go. 
THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL 
The receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, harsh place. 
CABMAN Not at all, sir. My... pleasure. 
He exits. 
Treves turns and sees the Matron, staring. 
TREVES I'll be in my rooms, Mothershead. I'm not to be disturbed. 
She nods silently. Treves looks at the figure for a moment. 
TREVES Come with me, please. 
He starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands there, motionless. 
We see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare at the figure. 
No one makes a move. 
MATRON You heard the doctor... Go on. 
Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, they all begin to talk excitedly. 
Mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy room. 
TREVES' OFFICE 
The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming. 
Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure. 
TREVES My name is Frederick Treves... I am a surgeon here at the London Hospital, and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical College... I would very much like to examine you. Would that be all right? 
The figure in the chair is still. Treves is at a loss. His sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm. 
TREVES Ah... yes. Um, first I would like to ask you a few questions, would that be all right? 
The figure does nothing. Treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil. 
TREVES Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner... um, the man who... who looks after you tells me that you are English and your name is John Merrick. Is that correct? 
The figure does nothing. 
TREVES Do you know where you were born? Where you come from?

But I'm sure you spent enough. 
JOHN 
Well I do have a certain standard of living. 
MIDNITE 
Tell me you found it. 
JOHN 
I found the vault. 
MIDNITE 
That's not what I asked. 
JOHN 
Hey, can I help it if Buddhist monks don't take bribes? Midnite strides toward him when John calmly pulls from his pocket a small ebony and gold RELIC. It stops Midnite cold. 
JOHN 
Gotcha. A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He takes the relic in his thick fingers -- stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind. 
MIDNITE 
Second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm... 
JOHN 
Right.    So we good here? Midnite ignores his outstretched palm, slides the relic precisely onto one of the many rods jutting from the Universal orrery. 
MIDNITE 
It should counter the iconic plane -- 
JOHN 
That damn thing's never going to balance. Midnite lets go and the complex machine actually starts to move. To turn. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John is somewhat intrigued until the newest relic collides with another and the orrery jams to a halt. Midnite deflates, stares at John, suspiciously. 
MIDNITE 
Must I remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health? 
JOHN 
It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece. Jesus... The two have a mini stare-down. John's rigid poker face is only broken by a cough. Midnite sighs, breaks it off. 
JOHN 
What? -- I didn't blink -- that was a cough. You never cough? Midnite reaches into his tuxedo jacket and hands over a thick stack of HUNDREDS. 
JOHN 
Better not be any Washingtons in here this time. 
MIDNITE 
Why did you cut your trip short? John stops the counting, actually thinks about it. 
JOHN 
I don't know... Just a feeling -- John suddenly spins toward the entrance doors, is stunned to see -- 
JOHN 
Balthazar. Balthazar is behind him.     Utterly confident.     Chillingly so. 
BALTHAZAR 
We're not still whining about Manhattan, are we? John's attempt to disguise his anger fails. 
BALTHAZAR 
That expression alone has made my entire night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
John takes several steps toward him.       Grins.   Malevolent. There's history here. 
JOHN 
I'll make your night -- I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand -- 
MIDNITE 
JOHN. 
John stops in his tracks. 
JOHN 
It's bad enough that you let these half-breeds in at all but this piece of shit -- 
BALTHAZAR

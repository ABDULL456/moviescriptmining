ASAKAWA Okazaki, can I ask you a favor? 
OKAZAKI Sure. 
Asakawa points to the newspaper. 
ASAKAWA Could you check out this article for me?  Get me some more info.? 
OKAZAKI I guess... 
ASAKAWA Good.  Call me as soon as you know more, OK? 
OKAZAKI Maam. 
Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans forward to take a look at the article. 
EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY 
Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it. 
INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  DAY 
A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We can see only the back of his head. 
ASAKAWA (O.S.) Yoichi! 
Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, run in the door.  She is panting lightly. 
ASAKAWA Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already changed. 
YOICHI Yup. 
He points over to his mothers right. 
YOICHI (contd) I got your clothes out for you. 
Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it. 
ASAKAWA Aargh, weve gotta hurry! 
She runs into the next room to change. 
INT.  BEDROOM  DAY 
Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is still in the living room. 
ASAKAWA Did grandpa call? 
YOICHI (O.S.) Nope.

{"test1_input": "WATER FOR ELEPHANTS \nWritten by \nRichard Lagravenese \nAPRIL 16, 2009 \nEXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT \nAn upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are being loaded with animals. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot. His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear, Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile. CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair. \nCHARLIE Excuse me sir, can we help you? (No reply from Jacob) Did you miss your ride? \nJACOB I missed the Spec. \nRUSS The what? \nCHARLIE Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we call someone for you? \nJACOB \n(SAD) Where'd it all go? \nRUSS He's seriously old. \nCHARLIE Did you come with the folks from the retirement home? \nJACOB No, I came on my own. \nCHARLIE \n(IGNORING HIM) Let's go inside and we can call them to pick you up. Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair. Jacob resists. \nJACOB No, I told ya, I came on my own and I'm not going back. Get your hands off me. \nRUSS (as if talking to a child) It's OK. We're gonna call the home so they can come pick you up. \nJACOB \n(SUDDENLY LUCID) Why don't you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you won't be so stupid, ya dumb little shit. \nRUSS Woah! The language. Uncalled for. \nCHARLIE Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot. My trucks have to come through here. Please... He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I got it Russ. Take the walker. Finish closing up the ticket booth. Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob. \nJACOB In my day, they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow. Damn kid didn't even know what the Spec was. \nCHARLIE You sound like you know circuses. Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home. \nJACOB I should. I was on two. \nCHARLIE (Calling OS to Trucks) Malcolm, tell them to come through! (Patronizing, to Jacob) Two circuses. Wow, that's something. \nJACOB Ringling, of course, but that was later... \nCHARLIE I'll need your name when I call the home. \nJACOB ...First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show ... Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name. \nCHARLIE What?...Wait a minute! Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers? \n", "test1_true": "JACOB \nCHARLIE \"\u009831?...You're saying you were there for the---? \nJACOB I was in the middle of it. \nCHARLIE \n(INCREDULOUS) I don't believe this. After the Hartford Fire and the Hagenback- Wallace Wreck, that's the most famous circus disaster of all time. \nJACOB I remember it like yesterday... Better - cause I don't remember yesterday. \nCHARLIE \n(EXTENDS HAND) Charlie O'Brien the third. \nJACOB Jacob Jankowski the only. \nCHARLIE Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer. \nINT. CHARLIE'S TRAILER -CIRCUS GROUNDS - TWILIGHT \nA bottle of expensive, Laphroaig scotch sits on the table. Charlie pours them each a shot. Jacobs drinks. It feels good. \nJACOB (to the Scotch) Ah, I remember you...Camel would've loved this stuff. \nCHARLIE Camels drink scotch? Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another; \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) You really got here on you're own? \nJACOB The Great Escape! But I got lost. \nCHARLIE I should call the home, let them know where you are. \nJACOB I don't know why they call it a \"home\"\u009d. You don't know anybody there. They fill you so full of drugs, you don't care...Five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died. They take turns visiting me on weekends. They forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up.. \n(BEAT) I had a life, ya know. A big life...It isn't right. Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject. \nCHARLIE So, how did the Benzini Brothers stampede start? The story is two guys got thrown off the train and-- \nJACOB No point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end. \nCHARLIE Sorry. From the beginning. \nJACOB Now, let's see...the beginning... Well, everything began the same day everything ended...Ha, isn't that how it always works?... \nINT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - JACOB'S BATHROOM - 1931 - MORNING \nA mirrored medicine cabinet closes revealing the reflection of JACOB JANKOWSKI - 23 years old, handsome, full of energy. \nJACOB (V.O.) It was a big day. My final exams. \nINT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - MORNING \nJacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen. JACOB'S MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast. The Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls. Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH... His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob thanks him in POLISH. He kisses his mother and exits. \nEXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - ITHACA NY - 1931 - MORNING \nA simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood. Jacob runs out, passing his father's sign on the front lawn: \nE. JANKOWSKI Doctor of Veterinary Medicine \nEXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY. \nThe beautiful campus of Cornell University. Jacob runs. \n", "test1_id": 1962, "test2_input": "LET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!! \nFrom inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams. \nJACOB (CONT'D) \nHE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO! \nEARL No he won't, kid. Come on. Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him. FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a louder one...Then an unnerving silence. \nEARL (CONT'D) See, it's over. Can we let you go? Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist. \nWALTER Come on Jacob. Walk away. With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - SALEM, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWalter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from behind the trunks. \nWALTER The only thing that's keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything. August can't risk getting rid of you here. But you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night. \nCAMEL (O.S.) What happened? Somebody turn me around. Share some of that jug! \nWALTER Shut-up Camel. \nCAMEL (O.S.) Well, what the hell...! \nCamel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk and see bloody Jacob. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! Who did that to you? \nWALTER August. \n(TO JACOB) Is it true? Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read between the lines....He lowers his head in despair. THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise. \nJACOB Why are we moving? We have a matinee tomorrow. \nWALTER Something's gone wrong. SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow. Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK COMES AGAIN as we hear: \nMARLENA (V.O.) Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena. They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal. Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I told him I'm leaving him. \nJACOB My God. Are you all right? \nMARLENA Looks worse than it feels. (Re: Jacob's face, laughs) Ha, look at the two of us. Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Can I have a swig of that? \nWalter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro. \nWALTER Why is the train moving? Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking: \nMARLENA We're being run out. Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job. Except, she... \n(STARTS LAUGHING) ...she was the police chief's wife. Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town. This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension. But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her out of the room for privacy. Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie: \nWALTER Aw girl. We're all in it now. \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nMarlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses.. \nMARLENA Why are you hiding that roustabout? \nJACOB Because Blackie and his men don't work the performer train and they'll red-light him if they find him. He can't work anymore. \nMARLENA My God. \n", "test2_true": "JACOB Does August know where you are? \nMARLENA No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and the girls. He won't go there. \nJACOB He can't find you. As soon as we stop - before we stop - we'll jump off and I'll take you to a hotel in town. \nMARLENA And after that? August has all our money. Where will I go? \nJACOB Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll find a way together. I won't let you go back to him. I promise. Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring; \nJACOB (CONT'D) ..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If I can take my finals again, get my degree, I can get my license. They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through the wooden slats. Making plans... \nMARLENA Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful. You know, I bet Ringling would take us both then - they'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that's a sweet deal for them. Although I won't be a star but I don't care. I'll take no billing at all...We'd be safe from August if we were with Ringling. \nJACOB Don't worry about him. \nMARLENA Of course, I'd have to wait a while until I can work again... \nJACOB What do you mean? \nMARLENA Jacob...I'm going to have a baby. Jacob is stunned...then confused... \nMARLENA (CONT'D) It's yours. Please don't ask me how I know...Is it all right? You can change your mind. I'd understand. Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it. \nJACOB Change my mind??? Oh Marlena, please...please be happy. \nMARLENA (Cries, relieved) I will...I promise...as soon as I stop being terrified. Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the hay. She nestles in his arms. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I'm so tired. \nJACOB Rest...I've got you now. Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning; \nFROM THE ROOF, AUGUST, BLACKIE & HIS MEN JUMP IN THROUGH THE \nOPEN STOCK CAR DOOR. THEY CHARGE INTO THE ROOM CAUSING THE \nHORSES TO PANIC. THE THUGS DRAG JACOB AWAY FROM MARLENA, \nBEATING HIM. AUGUST FORCIBLY TAKES MARLENA, HITTING HER... \nMARLENA JACOB \nDON'T HURT HIM!!!AUGUST NO!! MARLENA! MARLENA!... \nAS BLACKIE AND HIS MEN DRAG JACOB PAST WALTER'S MAKESHIFT \nDOOR, JACOB FIGHTS EVEN HARDER TO PULL THEM AWAY FROM \nBREAKING INTO WALTER AND CAMEL'S ROOM. \nFAST CUT TO: \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - BRONX \nKinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie hearing the screams and struggle. Camel quivers in fear behind the trunks. \nFAST CUT BACK: \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAUGUST IS DRAGGING A SCREAMING MARLENA THROUGH THE DOOR TO \nTHE PLATFORM - TAKING HER THROUGH THE TRAIN BACK TO HIS CAR. \nBLACKIE BEATS JACOB WHO CRIES OUT FOR MARLENA'S SAFETY, \n", "test2_id": 1963, "test3_input": "INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them... And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He \nAPPROACHES; \nJACOB Walter? Camel? \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible realization comes over him: Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted. \nJACOB \nWALTER! CAMEL!! He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He takes her in his arms. Jacob panics. \nJACOB (CONT'D) No..no..no..no....!!!! With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving train, his worst nightmare realized. \nPOV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) I wanted to believe taking Walter's knife didn't make a difference. But still. I left him without a fighting chance. Maybe they survived. Maybe they were tossed over grassy land...I couldn't let myself believe what I already knew. Jacob falls apart, crying without shame. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING \nA sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk, rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee. \nJACOB (V.O.) I waited almost til matinee time so I could let myself be seen by as many people from town. \nEXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING \nJacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding Queenie. He hasn't slept all night. As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive. With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed and ready for the matinee's performance. Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing. \nJACOB I'm not here to cause any trouble. I'm leaving. \nAUGUST Funny, I thought you already left. \nJACOB I'd like to say goodbye. To the menagerie. Just a few minutes and then I'll go. August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome. \nJACOB (CONT'D) There's nothing more you can do to me. Killing me'll be more trouble than it's worth, now that the rubes have seen me. You were right about me from the start August, when you said I wouldn't last...I can't survive here... \n(THEN) I am nothing. \nAugust feels victorious and therefore benevolent. \nAUGUST Earl, take him to the menagerie. Thirty seconds. Then escort him out of my circus, into Altoona. And if he comes back, you can shoot him, as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers. August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \nJacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her. Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more... After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time saying goodbye. Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters. \nEARL Come on kid. When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens: \nALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING \nTHEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR \nBELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE. The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it. \nEXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \nAs Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low. \nEARL It's good you're going. They must have known you got back on the train last night. He tossed more than half a dozen working men. \n(MORE) \nEARL (CONT'D) Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So that was meant for you. We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top. \n", "test3_true": "JACOB Walter! Is he---? Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news. Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens; \nEARL Keep walking...They got tossed off the trestle, if you can believe it. Camel's head hit the rocks. He died right away... Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell: \nEARL (CONT'D) ...Walter...Walter's legs were smashed up real bad..They had to leave him. \n(BEAT) They don't reckon he lasted the night. Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on... \nEARL (CONT'D) The ones that came back...Bill... Grady.. I don't know how but, one way or another they're taking down August tonight. Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl. \nJACOB Why are you telling me? Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these men does not sit well with him. \nSUDDENLY, WE HEAR THE BIG TOP MUSIC COME TO A CRASHING HALT, \nFOLLOWED BY AN UNGODLY COLLISION OF BRASS THAT FINISHES WITH \nA CYMBAL'S HOLLOW CLANG. Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed. \nJACOB (CONT'D) Earl, what was that? All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert. \nWE HEAR THE BIG TOP BAND START PLAYING AGAIN...THIS TIME IT'S \n\"STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER\"\u009d. \nEARL Oh Christ! Oh Shit... Earl runs back towards the Big Top. \nJACOB What is it? \nEARL The Disaster March! Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg appears amongst them and calls to Jacob: \nGREG \nJACOB! IT'S THE MENAGERIE!! THE \nANIMALS ARE LOOSE. \nJACOB RUNS THROUGH THE PANICKED CROWD, THE GROUND RUMBLING \nBENEATH HIS FEET...THE SOUNDS OF HOOVES ON HARD DIRT. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung up against the sidewall as: \nTHE YAK THUNDERS PAST HIM, HIS HORN INCHES FROM JACOB, THE HYENA ON HIS BACK. Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces; \nA FULL FLEDGED STAMPEDE: \n- ALL THE ANIMAL DENS ARE OPEN. \n- CREATURES OF EVERY SORT...CHIMP, ORANGUTAN, LLAMAS, ZEBRA, \nLION, GIRAFFE, CAMEL AND HORSES... RUN IN A MAD TERROR AS \nTHEY SCREECH, SCREAM, SWING, WHINY AND ROAR... \n- MONKEYS ARE SWINGING ON ROPES, SLITHERING UP POLES \n- THE CENTER CONCESSION STAND IS CRUSHED UNDER FOOT. \n- A TOWERING POLAR BEAR SLASHES WITH HIS SKILLET-SIZED PAWS, \nMAKING CONTACT WITH THE LLAMA, KNOCKING IT FLAT. \nJacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when: \n", "test3_id": 1964}

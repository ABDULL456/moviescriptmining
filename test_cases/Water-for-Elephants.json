{"train": "WATER FOR ELEPHANTS \nWritten by \nRichard Lagravenese \nAPRIL 16, 2009 \nEXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT \nAn upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are being loaded with animals. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot. His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear, Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile. CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair. \nCHARLIE Excuse me sir, can we help you? (No reply from Jacob) Did you miss your ride? \nJACOB I missed the Spec. \nRUSS The what? \nCHARLIE Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we call someone for you? \nJACOB \n(SAD) Where'd it all go? \nRUSS He's seriously old. \nCHARLIE Did you come with the folks from the retirement home? \nJACOB No, I came on my own. \nCHARLIE \n(IGNORING HIM) Let's go inside and we can call them to pick you up. Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair. Jacob resists. \nJACOB No, I told ya, I came on my own and I'm not going back. Get your hands off me. \nRUSS (as if talking to a child) It's OK. We're gonna call the home so they can come pick you up. \nJACOB \n(SUDDENLY LUCID) Why don't you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you won't be so stupid, ya dumb little shit. \nRUSS Woah! The language. Uncalled for. \nCHARLIE Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot. My trucks have to come through here. Please... He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I got it Russ. Take the walker. Finish closing up the ticket booth. Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob. \nJACOB In my day, they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow. Damn kid didn't even know what the Spec was. \nCHARLIE You sound like you know circuses. Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home. \nJACOB I should. I was on two. \nCHARLIE (Calling OS to Trucks) Malcolm, tell them to come through! (Patronizing, to Jacob) Two circuses. Wow, that's something. \nJACOB Ringling, of course, but that was later... \nCHARLIE I'll need your name when I call the home. \nJACOB ...First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show ... Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name. \nCHARLIE What?...Wait a minute! Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers? \nJACOB (V.O.) After six years of dissections, castrations, foalings and shoving my arm up a cow's ass more times than I cared to remember, I was finally going to graduate Cornell in Veterinary Science. I was summa cum laude...ha,ha and the oldest male virgin on campus. \nINT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL, 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY \nJacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and smooths her skirt. VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk. \nTHE PROCTOR You may begin. Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision. \nJACOB (V.O.) I had my whole life planned. I knew exactly where it was taking me... And then, with the opening of a door, it all vanished. The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then: \nTHE PROCTOR Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word? Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up. \nEXT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nJacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins. \nDEAN WILKINS Jacob, it's your parents. I'm afraid there's been a car accident. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - ITHACA HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nJacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse. We follow them inside. \nINT. CORONER'S MORGUE - ITHACA HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThe room is windowless and bare except for TWO GURNEYS, each with a sheet-covered body. A CORONER stands between them. Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe. \nCORONER Are you ready? The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder. Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression: \nCHAPLAIN Is there any other family to call? \nJACOB No. Just me. \nINT. EDMUND HYDE LAW OFFICES - DAY \nJacob, in a black suit. Mr. Hyde is seated opposite him. \nHYDE I know this is difficult for you, but there's been no mistake. The house and all their assets, including your father's practise, are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage. \nJACOB But I'm telling you, my father put away every penny he ever earned. They owned that house outright. Why would he have a mortgage? \nHYDE My guess is because he let people pay him in beans & eggs or whatever they had, instead of money. \nJACOB And so he's penalized for not turning away people who couldn't afford his help? He was a doctor. \nHYDE Yes, I know, he was a very good man but in banking terms, in the reality of what makes this world actually function, he was an irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but you oughta to know the truth. This Depression is going to last for a long while.. \n(MORE) \nHYDE (CONT'D) ..And the only ones who will be standing at the end of it, are the ones who fight to take what they need to survive. Everyone else is going to disappear. Don't make the same mistakes as your father. Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE ITHACA, NY - DAY \nJacob in his black suit walking home..looks up ahead to see: \nEXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nAll the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry...A foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign: \nJACOB (V.O.) Things happened so fast, my head was spinning. And that mortgage...I just couldn't figure it out. A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK REPRESENTATIVE, who receives a package and carries it to Jacob, meeting him halfway. \nBANK REPRESENTATIVE This just came for you, Jacob. Whatever it is I'm going to have to include in the bank's report of assets. Sorry. You OK? \n(JACOB NODS) I also have documents to sign.. The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the package, \nJACOB (V.O.) I didn't believe the lawyer or the bank. My mother worked. They had savings. We were never broke. So why would they need a mortgage? And then it hit me... Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading; \nE. JANKOWSKI AND SON \nJacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug. \nEXT. CIRCUS TRAIN/CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN. \nThe Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot. Beyond it, the scattered buildings of Deposit, NY backlit by dawn. \nJacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees:: Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH. Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it! Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling wagons are charging right for Jacob.. Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine. Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING \nJacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has barely been set up - just the tent and: \nTHE ANIMALS. Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain- link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps and an Orangutan. The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile. The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand. \nJACOB What is it? What do you want? The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing. Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the ground in front of the cage. He picks it up. Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and reaches out for Jacob again. \nJacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers. The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched. \nJACOB (CONT'D) You're welcome, ma'am. The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den. \nCAMEL (O.S.) What the hell you doing in here? Get outta there!! You ain't a menagerie man. Only menagerie men is allowed in there. Jacob runs out to Camel. \nEXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING \nCamel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car. \nCAMEL Gonna try to get you set up with Crazy Joe. \nJACOB Do I call him Crazy Joe? \nCAMEL It has been said Crazy Joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of Joe's neck. So no, I would not call this man Crazy Joe to his face. Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) Hey Joe! I got a First of May here. Think you can use him? Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco juice then disappears back inside. Camel tells Jacob; \nCAMEL (CONT'D) You're in, kid. \nINT/EXT. BAGGAGE STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING \nJacob and another Young Man, WADE, with their shirts off, are shovelling tons of horse manure. Jacob is queasy, blinking from the stench. The Young Man doesn't seem bothered. \nJACOB I've never seen so much manure! \nWADE Baggage stock horses. They pack'em in 27 a car. \nJACOB How do you stand the smell? \nWADE What smell? \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING \nJacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull on cables hoisting up the canvases on the Big Top. It takes a tremendous effort. Jacob uses every bit of strength. When the Big Top is raised, Jacob can't help but be impressed with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk (rubes) cheer. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY \nJacob struggles to shovel LLAMA manure out of the menagerie. He checks his hands - they are blistered and bleeding. \nEXT. SIDESHOW TENTS - MIDWAY - DEPOSIT, NY - AFTERNOON \nCECIL, THE BARKER, is \"speechifying\"\u009d from a platform beside the sideshow entrance, strutting back and forth, as a crowd gathers... Jacob and other working men, including Wade, are positioned around the perimeter of the crowd. \nWADE When Cecil gives the signal ya gotta push the rubes in towards the entrance but without them catching on or else they'll be a fight. Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil. \nWhen Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)...Jacob and the other men move forward, inching the crowd into the sideshow tents. \nEXT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY \nJacob shovels YAK manure more easily having taped his blistered hands. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) \n(JACOB CHOKES) ..Woah, you better take a breath before it all comes back up on ya. Here. Have a hit of Jake. He offers Jacob his \"Jake\"\u009d. Jacob drinks and chokes. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) It's an acquired taste. Now get yourself outta there. I'm gonna take you in to see August. As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and takes up more space. \nJACOB But it's the middle of the night. \nCAMEL Only time circus people live - when they don't have to work. Come on... \nINT. SLEEPING CARS/ PLATFORM - TRAIN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT \nCamel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing the lowly conditions of life on the road...wooden bunks, no private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share. \nTHROUGHOUT THIS NARRATION WE JUMP CUT INTO VARIOUS CARS: - The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor. The Trumpet Player plays TAPS. Jacob doesn't understand why. \nCAMEL I got a son about your age. Lives outside of Reading, PA. Haven't seen him for years. Fix your shirt there. Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid. - The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last mile. One Clown waves goodbye. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) Remember, when you meet August let him do the talking and don't ever mention Ringling. He hates them bastards worse than the Depression. \n- Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms of undress, negligees, sheer robes. Barbara exits a bathroom and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude; \nBARBARA How's your pipe, kid? Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away. \nCAMEL Night ladies. \nBARBARA AND GIRLS Night Camel. \nINT. PERFORMER STATEROOM CARS - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nSlightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger aisle outside individual doors and windows. \nJACOB Hey Camel - who's that woman who works the horses? \nCAMEL \n(STOPS) Now stop right there. That's Marlena. She don't talk to nobody and you don't talk to her. And don't mention her to August. Ain't no right way to talk about somebody's wife and make it sound like a compliment. \nJACOB Wife? Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask: \nCAMEL Look, kid, before we do this, I gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to know your business but I do know you ain't been on the road too long. You're too clean, your clothes too nice and you don't got a possession on you. See, a man on the road collects little things. It's not a big life I can tell ya. So before you start, I ask: if you got any kind of life to go back to, that's what you should do. \nJacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says: \nJACOB I don't. Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said. \nCAMEL I am sorry to hear that. They move on. \nEXT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nThey reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet. Standing upon it is an enormous, muscular BALD MAN, EARL... \nCAMEL This here's Earl. He's gonna take you in. Earl, this here's Jacob. \nJACOB (shakes hands w/Camel) I don't know how to thank you. \nCAMEL HA! You may not want to after you been on a show long as I have. Good luck to ya, kid. Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks: \nJACOB Do I look OK? \nEARL Very nice. Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him head first into the car. \nINT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers. Sitting at a table playing cards are CECIL the Barker, DIAMOND JOE (menagerie and ring stock), MR. ERWIN (talent booker), CRAZY JOE (baggage stock) and, with his back to us in a high wing back chair, (UNCLE) AUGUST ROSENBLUTH. \nEarl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor. As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout... \nJACOB August.. When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard... \nAUGUST \n(SINCERE) It's good to have an educated man like you around. I need one other sane individual in this operation. \nJACOB \n(COMPLIMENTED) Thank you for everything, August. August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket. \nAUGUST (O.S.) Ah...Jacob? \nJACOB \n(STOPS) Yes, August? \nAUGUST The horse. August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought he was going to bathe. \nJACOB Oh! Yes...The horse. Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride. \nEXT. RING STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING \nDiamond Joe and GREG, a ring stock man in overalls, are leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car... \nAUGUST I'm sure it's nothing serious. Don't tell my wife I said this but she coddles them too much. She has a particularly strong affection for Silver Star. I don't encourage it. It's unhealthy to love an animal that much...Here she is. Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski, Benzini Brothers own veterinarian. \nJACOB It's a pleasure to meet you. Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful). August puts his arm around her and they kiss. \nAUGUST Last stall. Lead the way, doc. They enter the ring stock car... \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING \nJacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver Star is laying down. He is breathing heavily, his rib cage rising and falling. Jacob immediately senses the worst. \nAUGUST Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad in the show. Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain. Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head, and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby. Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to examine him as Marlena watches protectively. Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof, which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge. Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Is that the problem? \n(JACOB NODS) Do you need any hoof testers? Diamond Joe has them... \nJACOB Not yet. \nAUGUST Well, how are you going to fix it? Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob doesn't want to tell her the truth. Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper. \nJACOB I didn't want to say anything in front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's already foundering. \nAUGUST English. \nJACOB This horse isn't getting back on his feet, August. If there was anything I could do, I would but we're going to have to put him down...I'm real sorry. Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone: \nAUGUST I know you are. Come with me. August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows. \nEXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT \nTWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top. Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one. \nAUGUST Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm afraid. Jacob here says there's no hope. We're going to have to put him down... Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ...So I need you to round up Pete and Greg, get a wagon and a harness stretcher. He has to be hauled. \nDIAMOND JOE A harness what? \nAUGUST Jacob and I'll take care of the cats. We'll meet you back at the stall. \n(TO JACOB) Grab the other bucket, will you? Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat. \nMARLENA But August won't let you. \nJACOB (Beat. Then:) If I'm the show's vet then it's my decision, isn't it? \nMARLENA But August won't like it. \nJACOB Then it'll be my last decision. Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't quite know what to make of him. \nEXT. STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MOMENTS LATER - TWILIGHT \nA determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady who are taking a break, smoking. Camel is drinking Jake... \nCAMEL Hey kid. What are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks? \nJACOB I need a gun. \nCAMEL It can't be that bad... They laugh but Jacob insists boldly. \nJACOB I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now! Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle. Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously. Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening. \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT \nJacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko exits his room with Queenie. Queenie growls. \nKINKO What do you think you're doing? \nJACOB Shut-up! Both of you! Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena. \nJACOB (CONT'D) You should go. \nMARLENA No. I'll keep him calm. Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots. \nJacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr. Jankowski. She exits O.S. with the rifle. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - LATER - EVENING. \nThe yaks are motionless. Flies buzz around their head and ears. Jacob swats them away...The Polar Bear is on his stomach, breathing heavily. Jacob smooths his coat....Jacob leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice near the polar bear who rolls closer to it. Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch. He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows... \nJACOB Friends now? August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks to the center and stops, staring at Jacob. Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence. Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him. \nAUGUST You've got a gift for them. Like Marlena with horses. It's God- given. I can always spot it. Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He continues on as he replies; \nJACOB My father used to say that to me. \nAUGUST He must have been a wise man. \nThis stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August. \nJACOB How is Marlena? August tilts his head curiously, with a smile. \nAUGUST You're a genuine curiosity Jacob Jankowski. What am I to do with you? ... I threaten to throw you off a moving train, feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway. So I think - Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse, that horse must have been in pretty bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show. And so I think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around. \nJACOB Tell Diamond Joe the animals need more water when the humidity's this bad if I don't see him before I go. \nAUGUST You're not going anywhere. You belong here. These animals..they've been waiting for you. Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then: \nAUGUST (CONT'D) But don't ever disobey me like that again. I'll give you this one. I'll call it \"respect\"\u009d...Next one I call \"betrayal\"\u009d. Understood? \n(JACOB NODS) I do thank you though. You and Silver Star solved a much bigger problem for me. August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket. \nJACOB What problem? August lights, inhales, blows smoke then: \nAUGUST The cats. You see, meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners. And you saw what we had to feed them. \nJACOB What does Silver Star have to do with the cats? \nJACOB She has such long eye lashes. \nDIAMOND JOE She's a hundred if she's a day. We're lucky if she can move. \nAUGUST Darling, what do you think? She's magnificent, isn't she? Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent. August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie but feels the tension between them. ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders. \nROSIE'S CARETAKER You the bull man? \nAUGUST No. (Refers to Diamond Joe) This is my menagerie man. \nROSIE'S CARETAKER Where's your bull man? Ya got no bull man, I gotta tell the township or else they can't sell her to ya. August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward; \nAUGUST Here he is. He's my bull man.. Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then: \nROSIE'S CARETAKER All right. See this animal...this here's the stupidest Goddamn animal on the face of God's good earth....Here's your bull hook. You're gonna need it. He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob. \nAUGUST I don't believe it. The mayor said she was the best bull you had. \nROSIE'S CARETAKER If she was the best bull, why is she the only one left? You think you're the first show to turn up picking on the bones? August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things: \nROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D) Some elephant tramp who dropped dead in Genesee sold her for a song which still ain't no bargain cause she ain't done a damn thing since but eat everything in sight. (Starts to walk away) Well, good luck to ya. And if I don't ever see another dumb bull in my life it'll be too soon. \n(SPITS) Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his head in a stream of water. Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes. \nThe Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on. August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened. \nAUGUST Joe, you and Greg come with me. We have to find a car to renovate. \n(TO JACOB) See what you can do with her. They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an awkward pause between them...then: \nJACOB Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here but - but I had no idea they were going to do that to Silver Star. \nMARLENA I know....Thank you. This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) And please, call me Marlena. I'm not a snob like everybody thinks. Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up. \nJACOB Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski. This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth. Can you say Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth? Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide. \nJACOB (CONT'D) You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a little dry, you oughta take care of that. First thing you notice about a woman's age is her skin. Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body. Marlena giggles. Jacob plays it up to make her laugh. \nJACOB (CONT'D) Are you flirting with me young lady? I usually like to make the first move... \n(MORE) \nJACOB (CONT'D) (Her trunk taps his head) I like to get to know a girl first...take her out. Meet her folks... (Her trunk goes lower) Of course, aggressive women can be a nice change... (She tickles him) Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob. \nMARLENA I think you two are engaged. They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena. A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent. All the workmen have left. Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them. There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I think Rosie likes music. That harmonica song is lovely. \nJACOB I'm confessin that I love you. Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's \"confession\"\u009d. \nMARLENA What? \nJACOB The name of the song. \"I'm Confessin' That I Love You.\"\u009d \nMARLENA (overlaps, realizing) --\"\u009dConfessin' that I love you.\"\u009d Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking Rosie, trying not to look at each other. \nJACOB MARLENA Louis Armstrong. Right. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - GOSHEN, NY - LATE AFTERNOON. \nJacob enters. Kinko is on his bed reading his \"Aristotle\"\u009d but quickly shuts the book. Queenie growls at Jacob. \nKINKO Queenie stop. Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW BED ROLL AND PILLOW, upon which sits a LETTER. He reads it: \n\"MR. & MRS. AUGUST ROSENBLUTH REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR \nJACOB I have to tell you something. You may not trust me after you hear it. August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention. \nJACOB (CONT'D) I never took my final exams at Cornell. I'm not a real vet. Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire earnestness with which Jacob made his statement. \nJACOB (CONT'D) But it's true. I never got my degree. I'm not a licensed vet. They laugh even harder. \nAUGUST BAH! A worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league! Of course you're a vet. You have the gift. You're idealism is just so...sweet. When are you going to learn that the rules written of, by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us. \nJACOB Not about this, August. \nAUGUST All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth? \nJACOB (Beat. Then laughs) No. \nAUGUST No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at the tops. And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? He's from Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to ink himself. And you know what I did when the hippo died? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her. For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo.. \n(MORE) \nAUGUST (CONT'D) (Jacob & Marlena laugh) ..The world is run on tricks - in here and out there. So trust me, it's having a talent that counts. In this world, it's all that's real. Look at this country, these dead, God awful towns we play. Talent and illusion bringing life to what is dead...Even for just a matinee. How wonderful is that? Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement. August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) To talent and illusion! \nJACOB To Rosie! \nMARLENA And Silver Star. August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena... \nAUGUST To all we love. He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes. Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME. August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice, encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer, filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only laugh along. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Come on Jacob! It's customary to sing for your supper! Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them. August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They begin to slow dance, very intimately. Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance: \nJACOB (V.O.) He looked like a different man when he looked at her. I said to myself, maybe love does that to a man. I didn't know much about it. Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively. \nMARLENA Darling. Darling, please.. \n(GIGGLES) Gently. We have a guest. August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't respond. He remains intense... \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Darling, what is it? August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete control, as if searching for proof of something he can't trust. His grip tightens, hurting her. Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) August, dear... She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) You don't know your own strength, my love. And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens, relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Auggie? August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena and throws himself face first on the bed. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Excuse me, Jacob. Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring. \nMarlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room. \nJACOB Is everything all right? Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG. \nMARLENA Oh yes. He's just had too much to drink, that's all. I hope you had a good time tonight. I wanted so much to make things up to you. \nJACOB Tonight was your idea? \nMARLENA Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened. He really does like you Jacob. But it's hard for him. He's under a lot of pressure. He does more than people realize holding things together. \nJACOB You said that. \nMARLENA Well it's true... (Opens her arms to him.) One dance before you go? Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Jankowski is Polish isn't it? \nJACOB \n(NODS) Is that all right? \nMARLENA \nJacob hops up into the car. Kinko is giving a party, with a bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face. Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL. Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in: \nJACOB \nBRAVA QUEENIE! BRAVA! But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop and growl at him. Jacob stops. Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants. He is ripe for the picking! They get an idea! \nKINKO JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like you all to make him feel at home! Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily, raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him. \nIN BLACK OUT....WE HEAR A SCRAPING NOISE THEN SEE A SLIVER OF \nLIGHT AS A LID IS OPENED. \nINT. TRAIN CAR/CLOWN ALLEY CAR - EN ROUTE - MORNING \nKinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside; \nJACOB (O.S.) Where am I? Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob. \nKINKO Where are you right now or where are you in an Aristotelean context because right now you're in a trunk. Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown... \nJACOB (O.S.) Where are my clothes? I'm not wearing anything underneath this--- \n(THEN:) \nOH MY GOD...SOMEBODY SHAVED MY... \nKINKO Huh-huh. As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms. \nJACOB (O.S.) What the hell did I do last night? \nKINKO You threw up on Barbara...And maybe Nell. \nJACOB (V.O.) I feel sick. \nKINKO You look a little pale. Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time: \nJACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN. \nINT. TRAIN CARS - CONTINUOUS - MORNING \nJacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off. Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - TUXEDO PARK, NY - MORNING \nHaving cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes. Kinko sits on his cot \"reading Shakespeare\"\u009d with a melancholy Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls... \nKINKO Your balls itchy? \nJACOB \nYES THANK YOU! Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress. \nKINKO It'll grow back. Aw come on, you still store about last night? Now I figure we're even. In fact, I probably owe you one. Feel free to borrow a book. \nJACOB Let's just drop it. Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet. \nJACOB (CONT'D) What's wrong with Queenie? \nKINKO What do you mean \"wrong\"\u009d? \nJACOB I mean she's not hating me. Something's wrong. \nKINKO (Concerned, pets her) Yeah, she's been like this all day. I don't know...she must have eaten something. She did her business and it was kind of...watery. \nJACOB Her stool? Did you look at it for parasites? \nKINKO \nAUGUST I'm opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night. We'll see how she does with the crowd. She got any skills? \nJACOB Finding food? But I don't really know how to do this. \nAUGUST Well, first of all, you can't do anything with a bull without the bull hook. August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) It's the only way to train them. Watch. Jacob steps back. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) \nUP!..UP!...COME ON UP! August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie lifts her foot a little. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) \nHIGHER UP...UP! August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh with blood. Jacob gets upset. \nJACOB August, there's got to be another way. \nAUGUST We don't have the time! She has to start earning her keep MOVE! UP! \nUP!! August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to shout. Rosie is getting agitated...pulling away from him but constrained by her chain. Her eyes fearful. Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as August strikes Rosie harder and harder. She begins to bleed. Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook... \nJACOB Please, August, let me try again. But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob: \nAUGUST Don't tell me my business! You don't want to watch this, get the hell out! Making love to it ain't going to work. Besides, from what I hear, you're not that good at it. \n(TO ROSIE) \nGET UP! UP!!! Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATER THAT DAY \nRosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook. Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them. \nJACOB I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more here. Hold still. The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from outside the tent. When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As Jacob straightens up, he sees: Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and up under the canvas flaps. \nJACOB (CONT'D) Rosie? \nEXT. MENAGERIE TENT/MIDWAY - TUXEDO PARK - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nA VAT OF LEMONADE LEFT ON THE CONCESSION STAND, which is in the process of being dismantled. Work men are carrying items back to the train. WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her body hidden, searching for the lemonade. Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat of lemonade and drink the entire contents. Jacob is amazed. He looks around: Workmen are some distance away loading the train. No one else sees her. Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - CONTINUOUS - DAY. \nRosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back into the ground. Jacob can't believe his eyes. He laughs. \nEXT. TRAIN - EN ROUTE T0 NEW JERSEY - DAY \nAs the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey...Jacob is looking out of open car to NYC skyline across the river. \nJACOB (V.O.) We were on our way to the Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr. Erwin still hadn't found a fat lady. Tickets sales were low. So August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat trick. \nEXT. STREET PARADE - WEEHAWKEN, N.J. - DAY \nAugust is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat, then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his head in respect for Lucinda. Manhattan is in the distance. \nJACOB (V.O.) A parade like you never saw, a funeral and a celebration, saying goodbye to one star, introducing a new one...playing those rubes dying to get a peek like he was rolling a coin over his finger tips... Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride. Lucinda's Wagon, carrying \"the dead Lucinda\"\u009d, follows. \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) It wasn't really Lucinda in there. It was Barbara in a fat suit and wig inside the hippo den. We buried the real Lucinda by the railroad tracks between towns. Cemeteries cost too much. We were the only family she knew. People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the \"dead\"\u009d fat lady. \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) August sure was right about Rosie. She pulled the people right in. Rosie played that crowd like a pro. The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with their parents. As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly. \nEXT. BIG TOP - SPEC LINE UP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - DAY \nWE HEAR: The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec. \nJACOB But as soon as the Spec started, we all knew it was too soon for Rosie's debut. Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter. \nThe show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing for the aerialist act in the background. \nAs Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses paths with August, whose face is \"dark as thunder\"\u009d. \nJACOB How's Marlena? \nAUGUST A little shaky. Sore wrists. Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be fine. Did you catch the bull? \nJACOB She's in the menagerie. \nAUGUST Good. August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him; \nJACOB August! Wait! She was good! She came back on her own! Besides, you can't do anything now! The show is still going on. \nAUGUST \n(WALKING) Good. The band will drown it out. \nJACOB \nAUGUST, NO! Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent. \nMARLENA (O.S.) Jacob! Jacob sees Marlena running towards him. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT \nJacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see: \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT \nAugust is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the entrance as Jacob runs to August. \nMARLENA \nAUGUST...STOP!!! August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with: \nAUGUST Get her out of here! NOW! Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August continues to beat Rosie. \nEXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT \nMarlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans into him. Jacob loves being this close to her. The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see: Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He is kicking and struggling against them like a madman. Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT \nRosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes. Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken. \nJACOB Rosie, what am I going to do with you? Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk lifts and wipes at her own eye. \nGreg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket. \nGREG Here this will help. Poor beast. He really hurt her. Told you about him. (Curses August in POLISH) Don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place. He shouldn't have the right, if you ask me. Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT \nEarl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted; \nEARL'S MAN Somebody better find Earl. \nINT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor. \nAUGUST (O.S.) Marlena...! August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Do you know where Marlena is? Did she send you? \nJACOB No....What happened? \nJacob leads August to Rosie. A curious Greg stops tending to Rosie. Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words. \nJACOB Just read those out loud. To Rosie. August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help... \nAUGUST Rosie...da--da--- \nJACOB Daj. \nAUGUST Daj...daj..no-ge. Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried. Greg suggests, in a low whisper; \nGREG Might help if he said please. \nJACOB Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge. \nAUGUST Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge. Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam. \nJACOB Go on. \nAUGUST (Reads and recites) Rosie...potoz noge. Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) (Reads and recites) Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu! Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps backward. August is amazed. Jacob is thrilled. \nJACOB (V.O.) That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell us was the elephant tramp who sold Rosie to them was Polish... August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth. \nAUGUST We've got a new star! Greg remains cautious. \nPRE-LAP : LIVE JAZZ BAND MUSIC. \nINT. NEW YORK CITY SPEAKEASY - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe live band plays on a raised platform. The dance floor is jammed with couples. \nTables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of bottles in front of a smoky mirror. August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his eyes off of her. Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table. However, she is acting distant to August. August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens; \nAUGUST Would you like to dance, darling? \nMARLENA No, thank you. Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks the last of it. August tries to make light of it. \nAUGUST We need more champagne. \nJACOB I'll get it. \nAUGUST No, you stay with Marlena. August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset. August lets her be. He exits O.S. \nJACOB You ever going to let him off the hook? \nMARLENA Hook? That's an unfortunate choice of words. \nJACOB Rosie's going be great. He won't hurt her again. I know it. \nMARLENA Jacob, what you know about August is pretty much nothing. \nJacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too brusquely. She softens, and explains with vulnerability; \nMARLENA (CONT'D) You know how many star acts we've had? How much money we've made and lost and made...? Silver Star paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him. Everything August touches gets fed to the cats one way or another. \n(SADLY) He'll never change. Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I want to dance. \nJACOB Maybe you should wait for August. \nMARLENA I want to dance now! She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she unwinds away from, like a ribbon. When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance - including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar: August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage. Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear; \nOFF CAMERA SHOUT \nRAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!! PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob. Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are strangers running in every direction, people screaming.. Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway. \nAUGUST ..It's a family. And like any family, when a new member is born, it's arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude. Now, we've been a little busy with sold out performances, thank the Gods.. \n(EVERYONE CHEERS) \n(MORE) \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ..but right now I want to take this moment before today's show to gather together..We close our eyes.. Everyone closes their eyes. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ..and we thank whoever's up there that sends desperate men running for the rails.. Everyone laughs. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ..because it was a lucky day when Jacob Jankowski jumped our train. Because of him - together with our beautiful Rosie and my beloved Marlena - we have the greatest star attraction in Benzini Brother's history. He found a way to save us all. And so, to officially welcome Jacob into the family, we open our eyes.. Everyone opens their eyes. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ..And we give him the traditional Benzini Brothers baptism. \nSUDDENLY, EVERY CLOWN PULLS OUT A SELZTER BOTTLE AND DOUSES \nJACOB..BARBARA AND ALL THE GIRLS THROW HALF A DOZEN PIES INTO \nHIS FACE AND BODY. OTHERS THROW CONFETTI, STREAMERS... Jacob is a mess, covered in pies, seltzer and confetti. The company breaks up with laughter, applauds and cheers...Walter and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him. The rest of the company follows suit. August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a distance...The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box. August watches Jacob open the box to find his own TUXEDO. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Now you don't have to borrow mine. Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob: \nJACOB Thank you, August. \nAUGUST It's from both of us. Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously; \nJACOB Thank you, Marlena. \nMARLENA You're welcome, Jacob. As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching from them a distance; August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding. \nEXT. BIG TOP - SALEM, NJ - DAY. \nMarlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual. Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands Rosie to follow him, but stops when: \nMARLENA I wonder if you could help me. \nJACOB Sure. \nMARLENA \n(PROFESSIONAL TONE) I've planned a surprise for August. He's been so wonderful, don't you think? \n(JACOB NODS) Could you make sure Rosie is staked in my tent after the show? \nJACOB No problem. \nMARLENA Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too. Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think. \nINT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT \nRosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily occupied with a pile of watermelons. Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace. There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when Jacob enters. \nMARLENA Oh, he'll be here any second. Jacob, can you open this for me? Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork. Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well. \nJACOB Rosie...get away....ssstop!! Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to laugh even harder when the cork pops... \nAUGUST (O.S.) What is this? Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top. \nMARLENA/JACOB \nOH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE! Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him. \nAUGUST Did you show Jacob the opening night present I gave you? Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace. \nMARLENA (indicating the necklace) Oh. No...Do you see Jacob? \nJACOB Beautiful. \nLET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!! \nFrom inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams. \nJACOB (CONT'D) \nHE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO! \nEARL No he won't, kid. Come on. Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him. FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a louder one...Then an unnerving silence. \nEARL (CONT'D) See, it's over. Can we let you go? Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist. \nWALTER Come on Jacob. Walk away. With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - SALEM, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWalter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from behind the trunks. \nWALTER The only thing that's keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything. August can't risk getting rid of you here. But you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night. \nCAMEL (O.S.) What happened? Somebody turn me around. Share some of that jug! \nWALTER Shut-up Camel. \nCAMEL (O.S.) Well, what the hell...! \nCamel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk and see bloody Jacob. \nCAMEL (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! Who did that to you? \nWALTER August. \n(TO JACOB) Is it true? Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read between the lines....He lowers his head in despair. THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise. \nJACOB Why are we moving? We have a matinee tomorrow. \nWALTER Something's gone wrong. SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow. Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK COMES AGAIN as we hear: \nMARLENA (V.O.) Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena. They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal. Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I told him I'm leaving him. \nJACOB My God. Are you all right? \nMARLENA Looks worse than it feels. (Re: Jacob's face, laughs) Ha, look at the two of us. Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice. \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Can I have a swig of that? \nWalter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro. \nWALTER Why is the train moving? Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking: \nMARLENA We're being run out. Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job. Except, she... \n(STARTS LAUGHING) ...she was the police chief's wife. Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town. This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension. But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her out of the room for privacy. Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie: \nWALTER Aw girl. We're all in it now. \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nMarlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses.. \nMARLENA Why are you hiding that roustabout? \nJACOB Because Blackie and his men don't work the performer train and they'll red-light him if they find him. He can't work anymore. \nMARLENA My God. \nHOLDING ONTO THE OPEN CAR DOORS. THE MEN BANG HIS HANDS WITH \nTHEIR FISTS UNTIL JACOB LOSES HIS GRIP AND BLACK TOSSES HIM \nOFF THE FAST MOVING TRAIN. \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - GRAVEL/GROUND - NIGHT \nJACOB ROLLS DOWN THE GRAVEL. BLACKIE AND HIS MEN JUMP OFF THE \nTRAIN AND RUN TOWARDS HIM. JUST AS JACOB GETS TO HIS FEET, \nTHE MEN REACH HIM - AND BEGIN TO BEAT HIM. \nWITH A SINGLE BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, JACOB IS THROWN \nINTO BLACKNESS. \nEXT. WOODS/STREAM - ALLENTOWN, PA - LATER THAT NIGHT \nA heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi- conscious face down in a stream in the woods. Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision. Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT. He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground. He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the flickering light. He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using all his strength to get himself out of the woods. \nEXT. CLEARING TO TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing. Squinting through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees: \nTHE FLICKERING RED LIGHT IS A SIGNAL LIGHT ON A TRAIN TRACK. He walks, with legs barely able to move. He climbs up the gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk... \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - PRE DAWN \nJacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of Marlena's train. He has walked all night and into the day. \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY \nJacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead: THE BENZINI BROS. TRAIN and THE BIG TOP TENTS already set up. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY \nIt's pre-matinee. All the tents have been set up. The rubes are filling the grounds. The midway is packed with people. \nEXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nNell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the heat when she sees: Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can see him....Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train, then falls unconscious. Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob and immediately takes charge. Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as they walk through the car...Barbara is organizing a plan with the girls. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nNell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they walk among the crowd. The Coochie girls head for Blackie and his security men...They talk to them to distract them. We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing tricks with Queenie for the crowd. Nell whispers to Walter. His expression tells us what we know. \nEXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY \nBarbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a blanket. They turn him over, shocked by his condition. Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious. \nBARBARA Poor Kid...Help me with him.. \nJACOB (delirious to Tattoo man) Don't you work the matinee? \nTATTOOED MAN Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re- ink. \nBARBARA Don't talk. Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nJacob opens his eyes. Walter is applying wet cloths to his head. Camel watches nearby. Jacob suddenly rises; \nJACOB Marlena!! \nWALTER Sshh. Lie back. \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them... And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He \nAPPROACHES; \nJACOB Walter? Camel? \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible realization comes over him: Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted. \nJACOB \nWALTER! CAMEL!! He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He takes her in his arms. Jacob panics. \nJACOB (CONT'D) No..no..no..no....!!!! With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving train, his worst nightmare realized. \nPOV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) I wanted to believe taking Walter's knife didn't make a difference. But still. I left him without a fighting chance. Maybe they survived. Maybe they were tossed over grassy land...I couldn't let myself believe what I already knew. Jacob falls apart, crying without shame. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING \nA sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk, rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee. \nJACOB (V.O.) I waited almost til matinee time so I could let myself be seen by as many people from town. \nEXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING \nJacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding Queenie. He hasn't slept all night. As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive. With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed and ready for the matinee's performance. Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing. \nJACOB I'm not here to cause any trouble. I'm leaving. \nAUGUST Funny, I thought you already left. \nJACOB I'd like to say goodbye. To the menagerie. Just a few minutes and then I'll go. August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome. \nJACOB (CONT'D) There's nothing more you can do to me. Killing me'll be more trouble than it's worth, now that the rubes have seen me. You were right about me from the start August, when you said I wouldn't last...I can't survive here... \n(THEN) I am nothing. \nAugust feels victorious and therefore benevolent. \nAUGUST Earl, take him to the menagerie. Thirty seconds. Then escort him out of my circus, into Altoona. And if he comes back, you can shoot him, as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers. August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \nJacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her. Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more... After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time saying goodbye. Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters. \nEARL Come on kid. When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens: \nALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING \nTHEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR \nBELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE. The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it. \nEXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \nAs Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low. \nEARL It's good you're going. They must have known you got back on the train last night. He tossed more than half a dozen working men. \n(MORE) \nEARL (CONT'D) Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So that was meant for you. We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top. \n- THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB \nAND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP \nWHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK. Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena: Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE \nCONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE. \n- SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE \nCROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW \nAUDIENCE MEMBERS...THEY CHARGE INTO THE MENAGERIE ONLY TO \nFACE THE STAMPEDE.. \n- THE MASS OF ANIMALS CHANGE DIRECTIONS AND THERE IS AN INTER- \nSPECIES FLOCK; LIONS, LLAMAS AND ZEBRAS RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE \nWITH THE CHIMPS AND ORANGUTANS..A HYENA SHOULDER TO SHOULDER \nWITH A TIGER...TWELVE HORSES AND A GIRAFFE WITH A SPIDER \nMONKEY ON IT'S NECK...THE POLAR BEAR NOW ON ALL FOURS, \nCHARGING...ALL OF THEM HEADING FOR THE CROWD OF PEOPLE... \n- THE CROWD SHIFTS, RIOTING BACK INTO THE BIG TOP. CLOGGING \nTHE ENTRANCE...PEOPLE BANGING ON THE BACKS OF THOSE IN FRONT \nOF THEM.. \n- THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY \nDIRECTION... \n- A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS, \nSWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND... Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in front of Rosie. \nJACOB \nMARLENA! Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls out of view from Jacob. Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out. Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get under Rosie for safety. \nAugust pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage; \nAUGUST \nYOU! YOU DID THIS!! He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples August who refuses to let it go... JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like madmen fighting with the intention to kill. Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in him, as he beats August without mercy... But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound, August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck. Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede around the two men locked in combat. Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do. Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND. Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The chain still attached to her foot. Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob. Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see. Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him \nAS: Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She continues to hold the stake until August topples forward, dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg.. Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just \nBEFORE: \nA HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM. \nRosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear of the stampeding animals. Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive. WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing, Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's dead body. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \nThe polar bear is walking calmly down main street. \nJACOB (V.O.) It took days to round them up. Some we never did get back. \nINT. HOUSE - CHILDREN'S ROOM - ALTOONA, PA - DAY \n", "test1_input": "AUGUST Earl wait! \nEarl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued... \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Veterinary science? (Earl stops with Jacob) May I ask what school? \nJACOB Cornell. \nAUGUST \n(IMPRESSED) You're a Cornell graduate? Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob. \nDIAMOND JOE Marlena did want a vet to take a look at Silver Star. They cost. \nCECIL He worked the rubes for me this afternoon. Pretty good. \nCRAZY JOE He shovelled horse shit. Don't make him a horse doctor. August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it: \nJACOB I hear Ringling has its own vet. The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it amuses August, who faces him and smiles; \nAUGUST All right, Cornell. Come with me. August leads Jacob out. \nEXT. PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAugust and Jacob exit onto the platform. \nAUGUST Are you sure-footed, Jacob Jankowski? \nJACOB I believe so. \nAUGUST Good. Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of something around the side of the car and disappears. \nJACOB \nJESUS CHRIST! The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls. \nAUGUST (O.S.) \nCOME ON THEN! Jacob looks up to see: August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his hair blowing wildly in the wind...He points downward. Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing; He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps... Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the rungs. Jacob climbs to the roof. \nEXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nAugust gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged. \nPOV; THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM STRETCHES LIKE A \nGIANT SNAKE MOVING IN THE NIGHT, BENDING ROUND A CURVE. \nAUGUST It's a breath taking sight, isn't it? Always gets me. \n(THEN:) I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid- season. So you make sure this horse performs and the job's yours. Nine bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll feed you to my meat eaters and there won't be a trace left of you... Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles; \n(MORE) \nAUGUST (CONT'D) You do right by me, Jacob Jankowski...I'll show you what it's like to travel every inch of this country, every inch of this world, and be welcomed home in every street, be loved in every town...I'll give you a life most suckers can't dream of. Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow... The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confident and euphoric following August's exultant lead. \nINT. RING STOCK CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nAugust drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob. On one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses. The other side, there is a makeshift door. August kicks through the door, revealing a small room; \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nThis makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks. A DWARF \"\u009dKINKO\"\u009d (WALTER) is reading on his cot. He has red hair. He and August greet each other with polite disgust... \nAUGUST Kinko. \nKINKO (WALTER) August. \n", "test1_true": "JACOB How do you do? \nKINKO (WALTER) What is he? \nAUGUST I said his name is Jacob. \nKINKO (WALTER) I asked what, not who. \nAUGUST He's going to help out in the menagerie. \nKINKO (WALTER) A menagerie man? Performers don't bunk with working men. There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE. \nAUGUST Well there are performers.. (his hand indicates high \nSTANDARD) And then there are performers.. (his hand indicates lower \"Kinko\"\u009d standard) Considering we used to keep the goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you. Of course I can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie. (Kinko knows this threat) This gentleman is the show's new veterinarian - Ivy League no less - which puts him a good deal higher than you in my estimation. Perhaps you'd like to offer him your cot. As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko knows he has no choice. August smiles and turns to leave. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) I'll find you in the morning. Sleep well, Cornell. August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and Queenie, who snarls at him. Jacob tries to be friendly: \nJACOB A Jack Russell. They're very smart. \nKINKO (WALTER) \n(CALMLY) Queenie attack. \nQueenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is pressed against the wall. Kinko returns to his book. \nKINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D) You're not getting the cot. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - LIBERTY, NY - DAWN. \nJacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket beside Camel. Camel starts hitting his leg. He laughs: \nCAMEL Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me. Pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but I'm too ugly for that. \nAUGUST (O.S.) Jacob! Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his guard. He turns his back to continue washing. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) We can do better than this for our new vet. I'll arrange for you to start getting your own water bucket like the performers and bosses. Two buckets per person. Come... August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow... \nJACOB See ya Camel. \nCAMEL (sips his Jake) Yeah, take care kid. \nINT PERFORMER'S TENT - LIBERTY, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male performers are washing from personal buckets of water. \nAUGUST You'll need new clothes too. I'll set you up with the Monday Man. \nJACOB Monday Man? \nAUGUST What day of the week did your mother hang out the wash to dry? \nJACOB \n(REALIZING) He takes other people's clothes? \nAUGUST It's the Depression, Cornell. Where have you been? Oh right - Cornell. Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches one of them away. \nAUGUST (CONT'D) Here, use Kinko's second bucket for now. \n(TO KINKO) You barely use up one. Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate. \nJACOB August, it's all right, I'll-- \nAUGUST \n(IGNORES HIM) If you need a razor, there are some back there with my name on them. August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko. \n", "test1_id": 1962, "test2_input": "MARLENA (CONT'D) ...In an alley behind a whore house in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper. No one even bothered to leave a note...This circus, my horses - this is the only kind of life I can have. \n(BREAKING DOWN) August made a woman like me a star attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm safe...And I was fine - before you came. Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time... \nMARLENA (CONT'D) There's nothing that can cause a woman so much trouble as a good man. \nJACOB I'm not that good. And I don't want to be. \nMARLENA Don't say that. \nJACOB No, I don't. Good men don't wind up with much in the end except their goodness. Isn't worth much, is it? \nMARLENA \n(SADLY) See? ... Look what we've done to you already. She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer... \nMARLENA (CONT'D) Sweet Jacob. \nJACOB You deserve as good a life any other girl. \nMARLENA Am I still a girl? I feel so old. They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to kiss in between lines; \nMARLENA (CONT'D) This can only be tonight. We have to go back. Promise me you understand. \nJACOB I understand. \nMARLENA Promise me you'll suffer. \nJACOB I already am. \nMARLENA Promise you'll look in my eyes the whole time. \nJACOB I promise. Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up and locks the door. They sink to the ground. \nEXT. FERRY - HUDSON RIVER - NYC TO WEEHAWKEN - NIGHT \nMarlena sits inside Jacob's embrace on the ferry, her head leaning against his chest - their hands entwined. \nJACOB If I had money, if I could take care of you, would we be going back? \nMARLENA You'd have to be a Rockefeller... August would find me. He always does. \nJACOB Have you tried to get away before? \nMARLENA Jacob you promised. You said you understood it was only tonight. \nJACOB I know. I do....I'm sorry. \nEXT. WEEHAWKEN FERRY PORT - NIGHT \nJacob walks Marlena out of the port to a waiting cab. They stop a few feet from the cab. Jacob gives her all the money in his pockets. Marlena looks at him as if for the last time. \nMARLENA Where were you when I was 17? Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away. \nEXT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE-DAWN. \nJacob reaches the circus. Everyone is asleep. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE DAWN. \nJacob enters the menagerie, heading straight for Rosie. He gets on the ground beneath her and lies down...Rosie raises her trunk to allow Jacob to lie beneath her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSAME LOCATION - DAWN Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up. \nWALTER Why are you sleeping here? Somebody's looking for you. \n", "test2_true": "Jacob and Walter enter to find Bill and Grady hiding an ailing Camel in a dimly lit car. Jacob kneels down to him. \nCAMEL Hey kid. How nice to see ya. \nJACOB Hey, Camel. What's wrong? \nCAMEL I don't know, kid. Woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy. Jes can't feel'em right... \nCAMEL (CONT'D) \n(CONFIDENTIALLY) ...It ain't just that though. It's other stuff too. \nWALTER Like down there...man stuff? Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly. \nBILL What's wrong with him, doc? \nJACOB I don't know. \nWALTER Jamaica ginger paralysis. Jake leg. I've seen it before. \nCAMEL No such thing. Is there Doc? Walter looks at Camel's empty \"Jake\"\u009d bottle. \nWALTER The manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it, or something, to get around regulations that Jamaica ginger extract not be sold as booze. \n(TO CAMEL) You're not supposed to drink this stuff, ya know. \nCAMEL Well what the hell am I supposed to drink to stop the shakes? It's Prohibition and I ain't no Astor. \nGRADY It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday. We'll get you some moonshine. \nBILL Grady don't lie to the man. If men were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't have tossed four of \"\u0098em between Boonton and Weehawken. \nJACOB Four?...Will he get better? \nWalter looks at him, his expression says No. \nBILL We can't leave him here. They'll red light him for sure. Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter. Walter understands and reacts with an adamant: \nWALTER \nNO! NO! \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER - WEEHAWKEN - DAWN \nWalter is walking quickly back to the performer train. Jacob follows, trying to reason with him. Throughout the scene, they are looking out for Blackie's men and speaking low. \nJACOB Walter, please. Blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars. They don't work the performer train. We can hide him easy until- \nWALTER \n(STOPS) Until when? What are we going to do with him? Shoot him like Silver Star? Because that's what he is Jacob. In a week, he won't be able to move his legs at all. \nJACOB \n(THINKING FAST:) He has a son in Pennsylvania. Near Reading. We're playing there in three weeks. That's all he needs. Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no. \nWALTER I was right about you. You're going blow us all up...August got home tonight before you and Marlena. People are talking. Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news. \nWALTER (CONT'D) I shouldn't be a clown. I should be a Goddamn fortune teller. \nINT/EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MORNING \nThe cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain. One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper shakers. The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers. Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob approaches. He sits opposite her. \nJACOB Good morning. \n", "test2_id": 1963, "test3_input": "MARLENA Good morning Jacob, how are you? Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the table is far enough away, so they can't be heard. \nJACOB I wanted to, uh...Is there any chance I could speak with you alone? \nMARLENA About what? Is something wrong? \nJACOB No, I...I just wanted to...Walter said people are talking about what happened...last night... \nMARLENA \n(LAUGHS) Oh Jacob, champagne completely overwhelms my senses..I always feel the better for it when I abstain. All I remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking. I don't even know how I got home. I don't remember a thing. \nJACOB Well, I want to apologize for-- \nMARLENA Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings. You weren't even there. Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the night having great sex. August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together. \nAUGUST I slept like a baby after last night. Thank you my darling. \nMARLENA August, please. We're in public. Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated. \nAUGUST \n(SITS) Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places. \n(BEAMING) My Marlena has forgiven me. All's well with the world again, right Jacob? \n(JACOB NODS) That was quite an adventure last night. I'm glad I didn't have to bail you out. How did you get home? \nJACOB I don't know. I just ran. \nAUGUST \n(EATING) How did you two get separated? You were so close on the dance floor. \nMARLENA I told you, sweetheart. We got pushed apart by the crowd. This older married couple brought me to the ferry. \nAUGUST I'd like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge... \n(MORE) \nAUGUST (CONT'D) ...I'll even pay for their transportation. I'd pay it a hundred times over to anyone who helped my wife to safety. Thank goodness she had chaperones. If anyone had harmed her, or even touched her, there's no knowing what I might do. Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it. \nEXT. TRAINING RING - ASBURY PARK, NJ - DAY \nWhile Jacob coaches August from the sidelines, the company of performers and workmen watch August command Rosie in Polish. \nJACOB (V.O.) ...August said he would create an act for Marlena and Rosie that would have'em line up for miles... August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her foot...or walks forward, then backward.. \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) His accent was awful but Rosie obeyed without fail. Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August. He instructs Marlena where to stand. He commands Rosie who lifts Marlena up with her trunk. Everyone cheers and applauds. Those near Jacob pat him on the back, grateful that he saved the circus. Jacob smiles. \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was finally a part of them. \nPRE-LAP - CHEERS AND APPLAUSE, AS ROSIE LIFTS MARLENA ONTO \nHER BACK AND WE CUT TO: \nINT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - ASBURY, PARK - NIGHT. \nMARLENA ATOP ROSIE IN FULL COSTUME MAKING THEIR ENTRANCE TO A \nPACKED HOUSE AS AUGUST LEADS THE WAY TO CHEERS AND APPLAUSE. When they enter the center ring, they stop. August gives Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk. But Rosie hesitates. August commands her again, with more force. But Rosie doesn't move forward...she shuffles a foot backwards. August grips his silver tipped cane. Oh-oh... \nJacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail? Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to the crowd. When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously. Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek. August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say \"It wasn't me\"\u009d. August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again, Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, \"No, no, no\"\u009d Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him. And the crowd bursts into applause. August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and places her on the ground. \nEXT. NEW EGYPT, NJ - NIGHT \nPosters of ROSIE and MARLENA highlight the act COMING SOON!

Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and sits on a small ball. \nRosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk. Rosie copies Marlena's actions, placing her enormous rear down on a much larger ball. The crowd screams with laughter. Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie. She turns her back on her, folding her arms. Rosie also stands and presents Marlena with her rear end facing the other way. The audience loves it. \nJACOB (V.O.) In that center ring, Rosie became a guaranteed star attraction... \nINT. ROSIE'S CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT \nJacob sits alone facing Rosie, in her massive stock car made of steel, talking to her, in Polish... \nJACOB (V.O.) Alone with me, telling her every thing I couldn't tell anyone else, she became the closest thing I had to family. \nINT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY \nMarlena looks back and scowls. With dramatic flair, she raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say, \"Take that, elephant!\"\u009d Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish commands) curls her trunk, lifts her foot and places it on her larger ball. Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg, like a ballerina's, toe pointed. She place the foot alongside the other, so that she is now standing atop the ball. Rosie waits a moment, then lifts her other front foot onto the ball. The crowd explodes! August pretends to be outraged with Marlena. But as showers of coins and money rain upon them, August and Marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins. \nJACOB (V.O.) And August! Ha, August was a new man.. \nEXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ELMER, NJ - DAY \nThe workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit. August treating them with pats on the back of gratitude. \nJACOB (V.O.) ..treating everybody first class, spreading the word his Rosie act would finally get the men paid.. \nINT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nJacob, Walter and a Camel enjoy a card game and moonshine. \nJACOB (V.O.) ..And with business so strong, nobody was worried about getting tossed, so we didn't have to worry so much about old Camel. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY \nAugust is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for Rosie. \nJACOB (V.O.). And nothing was too good for Rosie. When August found out she liked gin and ginger ale, he made sure she got both every day, treating her like some favorite child... \nINT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - SALEM, NJ - DAY \nMarlena does a double take, then lifts up her finger as if to say \"I have an idea!\"\u009d. With a rising drum roll, she shuffles her feet atop the ball, moving herself around the ring... Rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and rolls herself around the ring...Marlena and Rosie go faster and faster, along with the music... THE CROWD GOES WILD....August takes Marlena's hand and kisses it as they take their bows. \nJACOB (V.O.) But I didn't trust the new August. I kept waiting for the real one to show up. \nEXT. ROSIE'S CAR - SALEM, NJ - MORNING \nOut of the darkness of the car, Rosie appears in the light, being guided down the ramp by August, who gently pets her trunk, whispering in her ear. Her ears flapping, she purrs with affection. Jacob watches. \nJACOB (V.O.) It was when I saw Rosie purring under his touch as if nothing had happened between them, that the worst thought occurred to me. \nINT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT \nMarlena and Jacob are laughing, listening to August telling a story after a private dinner. Jacob glances at Marlena... \nJACOB (V.O.) Maybe, I was the man not to be trusted. Marlena moves to August's lap. They kiss...Jacob watches \nJACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D) Marlena looked happy...And it broke my heart. \nPRE-LAP AUGUST: \nAUGUST (V.O.) The circus is nothing without it's traditions.. \nINT. MENAGERIE TENT - SALEM, NJ - DAY \nAugust has gathered all the performers and trainers in a circle. Jacob stands in the center. Marlena beside August. \n", "test3_id": 1964}

The Jupiter Two's engines BLOW, peeling into the endless night. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
(OVER) ALARMS sound. 
JUDY 
I think those things were using the probe ship as a way to trap food. 
WEST 
That I s probably what happened to the monkey's parents. We were going to be desert. 
MAUREEN 
But what happened to the crew? 
JOHN 
Nothing good. 
WEST 
We're not out of the woods yet. 
ON SCREEN. The hull of the Jupiter Two is covered with the giant spiders, their teeth cutting through the outer hull. 
WEST 
Let's see how these monsters like a hundred thousand volts. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO 
The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their limbs and heads retracting. 
WEST 
And the crowd goes wild. 
SMITH 
Recall your nightmares from childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded. 
(OVER) a THUNK. Then another. A third. 
ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the Jupiter, land on the hull again, re-extending their limbs, starting to burrow once more. 
WEST 
Persistent bastards. 
JOHN 
Can you hit them again? 
WEST 
Every time I electrify the hull, I'm draining our systems. Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space. 
SMITH 
A fate I fear may be inevitable one way or another. 
Maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in metal tongs. Carries it to her life sciences analyzer. 
JOHN 
That's the same expression you had when my mother came to stay with us. 
MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A graphic of the severed spider leg. A small line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. Musculature and flesh are drawn in on the screen. 
MAUREEN 
DNA extrapolation - coming up. Silicone based. Admantium shell and lack of respiratory system suggest an ability to live in deep space. Tiny front brain implies communal relationships. More like bees. 
VIEWS CREEN -CLOSE. More and more spider are spiraling from the probe ship, all heading toward the Jupiter Two. 
WEST 
There are thousands of those things 
Maureen is working the COMPUTER. 
MAUREEN 
They may be attracted to heat and light. 
Don begins typing. 
WEST 
With the right command codes, I can light up the probe ship from here. 
MONITOR-CLOSE. More spiders are hitting the bull. 
WEST 
Damn. No response. 
JOHN 
Command codes are sequenced. Try the next series. 
WEST 
But they won't work until the next fleet of ships are built. That's at least two years away. 
JOHN 
Just do it. 
Don begins entering command codes. 
The mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they begin their initial BURN. 
WEST 
How did you know? 
JOHN 
Think about it, Don. The ships's advanced technology. Your friend looking old. What if that ship is from our future? 
COMPUTER 
Warning. Outer hull has been compromised. 
SCREEN-CLOSE. Spiders are eating through the outer hull. 
MAUREEN 
It's not working. 
JOHN 
Can you get the fusion drive on line? 
EXT.-SPACE 
THE PROBE SHIP'S fusion drives FIRE. A few of the spiders divert back toward the probe ship. But most still head for the Jupiter. 
INT.-JUPITER TWO 
WEST 
Let's turn up the heat. 
Don engages the THRUSTERS, grabs the throttle.

{"test1_input": "ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12A. \nMATTHEW P1... please! I... I came to fix the plumbing. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 13. Jennifer turns off the hair dryer. \nMATTHEW (CONT'D) I... I was knocking on the d...door a...a... while. Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely make eye contact with her. \nJENNIFER \n(FRIENDLY) I think you may have taken a few years off my life. Matthew doesn't get the joke. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) Uh... thanks for coming on such short notice. \n(NO RESPONSE) You need to see the bathroom, right? \n21 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 21 \nMatthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to make small talk. \nJENNIFER Is this gonna take much longer? \nMATTHEW (muffled, under the sink) N...not much. \nJENNIFER So what's wrong with it? \nMATTHEW Uh... it's just older pipes. Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable with the conversation. \nJENNIFER So do you live around here? \nMATTHEW No...no one lives around here. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 14. \nJENNIFER Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant in town? Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously at one of the rubber bands on his wrist. \nMATTHEW My... my whole life... Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red. Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on the shower to the same result. \nMATTHEW (CONT'D) All fixed. Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek. \nJENNIFER Thank you! Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I just... you saved me from having to bathe in the pond. Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you! But Matthew is long gone. \n22 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 22 \nON MINIDV CAN LCD A wooden bat crashes down on a fish. It goes still. Stanley takes a MINIDV CAMCORDER away from his eye. He looks at Andy who's holding the bloody bat, and takes a large gulp from his beer, then-- \nSTANLEY Ground rule double. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 15. \nANDY \n(ANGRILY) A double! Look at its head. I knocked the eye clear out. Andy has, in fact, knocked the fish's eye clear out. It lays next to the creature, all weird and googly-looking. \n", "test1_true": "ANDY Would you turn that thing off? Gonna get us in trouble with that human society. \nJOHNNY Humane you dipshit. Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is perpetually glued to his hand. \nANDY Whatever. \nSTANLEY I told you. This thing is going to make me a fortune. All you got to do is film something crazy, then you send it into the internet, make a killing. \nANDY No one's gonna pay you for that crap. \nSTANLEY It's the hits, Andy. You just gotta get the hits. \nJOHNNY Hits my ass, now you two retards gonna fish or what? Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the cooler spilling ice and beer all over. \nANDY Speaking of retards. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 16. \nMATTHEW Q..Quit it Andy. \nJOHNNY Alright. Now we're all here, what's the big show, Stanley? \nSTANELY The big show is this-- Stanley holds up the video camera like a trophy. \nANDY Are you kidding me? That shit? What'd you do? Film yourself lighting a fart? \nSTANELY Better. Johnny just shakes his head. \nJOHNNY \n(TO HIMSELF) I don't know why I bother. \nSTANLEY I got Matthew's girlfriend in a private moment. \nANDY What do you mean like on the toilet or something? Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it. \nANDY (CONT'D) Matthew hasn't had a girl since he was sucking his mama's titties. \nSTANLEY Not true, my friends. And the evidence is right here. \nMATTHEW What are you ta... talking 'bout Stanley? \nANDY Yeah, what are you talking about? \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 16A. \nSTANLEY He had that babe from the city all alone and he didn't even try to nail her. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 17. This gets Johnny's attention. Matthew is snapping on of the rubber bands. It's a bit loud. Johnny looks to him as if it is annoying him. \nJOHNNY What babe from the city? \nSTANLEY You know, the one who stopped for gas the other day. The one who dumped you on your can. She had Matty here fixing her pipes. \nJOHNNY Bullshit. Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to him. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Cut that shit homo! How many times I gotta tell you. Stanley gets the camera ready. \n", "test1_id": 1080, "test2_input": "JOHNNY Nice shot huh? Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find -- Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He smiles. Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room. Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22A. But Stanley has slipped in through the back door, video camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to throughout). \nSTANLEY Smile real pretty for the camera. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 23. \nJENNIFER (her voice cracking) Get out of here. Get out of here right now! \nJOHNNY Now that's not very hospitable, is it? Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The guys get a good laugh at Andy. \nJENNIFER All of you better get out of here. I called the police. Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking. \nJOHNNY You called the police? Or you will call the police? \nJENNIFER I... I called them already. They're on their way right now! \nJOHNNY With what phone? Matthew said you dropped it in the drink. Jennifer doesn't answer. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) (looks at Stanley) Speaking of.. .where the hell is he? Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door. \nSTANLEY Matthew, get your boney ass in here! Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring himself to look at Jennifer. \nJOHNNY \n(TO JENNIFER) Matthew here said you didn't pay him for fixity' your sink? \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 24. \nJENNIFER That is just not true! I tried to. He ran out... (to Matthew) Is that what you said? Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist. as Jennifer walks over to her purse. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) I'll take care of it-- Johnny cuts her off. \nJOHNNY --Let's not worry about that right now. Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Now what's a pretty little thing like you doing out here all alone? \nJENNIFER I'm writing. I'm a Writer... But my boyfriend is coming up. He'll actually be here any minute-- \nJOHNNY That right? The guys give a good chuckle- \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Well, I didn't realize you had a boyfriend coming down. We'd better get on outta here. Don't want to ruin date night. \nSTANLEY Yeah, yeah. Date night. \nANDY \n(CHUCKLING) Date night... \nJOHNNY You know what I think. I think you're lying. There's no boyfriend. No man in his right mind would leave a girl like you all up here on your own. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 24A. \nJENNIFER \n(EMPHATIC) No he's coming. He had to work. I told you he'll be here soon. \n", "test2_true": "JOHNNY Yeah, well so will Santi Clause. Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) Come here. Have a drink with me. \nJENNIFER No, look. I have the money-- Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her feet. \nJOHNNY What's a matter? Too good to drink with us? \nJENNIFER Please, I don't want to. Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty. \nJOHNNY \n(TO JENNIFER) Uh, what's this? It's already been opened. \n(TO OTHERS) See, she don't want to drink with us. What are we, dirt? \nJENNIFER I didn't say that. Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the screen, begins reading aloud from the text... \nANDY \n(READING) .No one wants a phone call at 2 o'clock in the morning. When you're fifteen it's a prank call, when your twenty it's a drunk boyfriend call, but after twenty five, it's usually real bad news. That's how I found out my father died... \n(THEN) Whose daddy died? \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 26. \nJENNIFER Can you all please leave me alone?! Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces, spits it out. \nSTANLEY Damned cardboard. You eat this shit? \nANDY You should! Do you some good. Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at Jennifer, \nJENNIFER Look, can you just tell me what you want? What do you want? I offered you money. Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy giggles. He finds this quite funny. \nJOHNNY \n(EXTENDING BOTTLE) Here. \nJENNIFER Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a drink. Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a small sip. They all start booing. \nJOHNNY Come on. You can do better than that. I bet when you're out there with your city friends you can throw 'em back with the best of them. \nJENNIFER I took the drink, now you-- \nJOHNNY I said drink it! Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) See? Now was that so bad? Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself. \nJENNIFER Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you the other day, but we're even now, right? Okay. Please. Leave. Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table. \nJOHNNY Oh... that's not what this is about. \nJENNIFER Then what is this about? Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of Jennifer, towering over her. \nJOHNNY I want to see your teeth. As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at him, not even sure she heard him correctly. Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall. \n", "test2_id": 1081, "test3_input": "The reservoir is much calmer at these parts. Sheriff stands on watch as- Stanley and Andy come from the water in waders having just searched the water. Matthew stands where they just came from. He stays, staring at the swamp like water as if Jennifer was somewhere in there. Johnny finishes off a cigarette and flicks it. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 49. \nANDY Nothing. Not a damn thing. \nJOHNNY Well, what now? Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it. \nSHERIFF STORCH The body'll turn up. One way or another. Every day we check the ravine, from the bridge, straight through down here, then back. Two shifts a day until we find something. 'Cause with no body, you're all as fucked as she is. \nSTANLEY For how long? \nSHERIFF STORCH 'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go back to the cabin and get rid of her shit. All of it! Burn it. And we need to sanitize that place something good. I don't want so much as a stray hair left. \n(TO JOHNNY) Get her car to the shop. Strip it down to its last damn nut. \nJOHNNY I'll buff out the serial numbers too. Sell the parts at salvage. Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera. \nSHERIFF STORCH .and give me that. Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He pulls out the tape. He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks better of it, and closes it quickly. \nSHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) The fuck were you saving that for moron? \n(BEAT) Swear to Christ. \n(MORE) \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 50. \nSHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) I need all you on point.

Dirty fingers pull the match across the flint on the side of a matchbox. The match explodes to life. A hand drops the match on top of Jennifer's belongings: her clothes, laptop, the dry goods she purchased at the store. It's all piled up on the grass. Johnny, Stanley, and Andy watch quietly as the flames and smoke from the fire reach into the sky. Andy throws a metal container of gasoline onto the ground. \nANDY So that's everything. Right down to her little tit sling. \nJOHNNY And there was no trace at all? Nothing in the woods? In the shallows? Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard. \nSTANLEY I'm starving, man. \nJOHNNY Well ain't that the headline. Soon as we finish this and haul her car into the garage, you can stuff your face 'til you puke. \n(TO ANDY) What the hell happened to Matthew? \nANDY Idiot wanted to stay there. He was walking around in the water, looking for her like some crazed dog after a bone. \nJOHNNY Jesus Christ. He's not playing with a full deck as it is. \n(MORE) \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 50A. \nJOHNNY (CONT'D) The last thing we need is him getting squirrelly on us.

SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 50 \nMrs. Storch closes the door behind them. Chastity races from her room holding a piece of paper. \nCHASTITY Daddy! Daddy! Sheriff Storch picks up his daughter and kisses her head. \nSHERIFF STORCH Just the usual, domestic dispute out near Clifton. Took forever. \n(BEAT) Got anything on the stove? \nMRS. STORCH Sure. I'll reheat it. \n(RE: CHASTITY) You'll be proud. Chastity brings forth the piece of paper.

That's the trade off. \nISOYG PINK 10/29/09 53. \nSHERIFF STORCH Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't cite you for being a public health hazard. Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them.

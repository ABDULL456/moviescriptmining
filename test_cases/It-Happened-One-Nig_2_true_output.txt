DYKE'S VOICE 
I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple. 
Their voices die. Peter stands in the middle of the room watching them go. From her side, where she has been stalling, Ellie peers out of the window until the detectives vanish. She starts toward Peter. Then they appear together, both staring out until the detectives are well out of sight. Finally, Peter closes the door and turns to her. 
PETER 
(seriously) 
It'll be a dirty trick on Aunt Betty if it turns out to be a girl after all. 
This brings laughter from them both. But Peter suddenly sobers, and he looks at her thoughtfully. 
PETER 
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you? 
ELLIE 
You weren't so bad yourself. 
PETER 
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8] 
ELLIE 
Next week "East Lynne." 
PETER 
After that "The Three Musketeers." 
(he strikes a pose) 
I'd make a great D'Artagnan. 
ELLIE 
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story? 
PETER 
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe. 
ELLIE 
(fighting) 
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager? 
PETER 
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it? 
ELLIE 
You always want to run everything. 
PETER 
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company. 
ELLIE 
I refuse to resign! 
PETER 
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself. 
They are interrupted by the door being flung open. Dyke sticks his head in the door. 
DYKE 
Your bus leaves in five minutes. 
PETER 
Holy jumping! We haven't started to pack yet! 
And they both scurry around, throwing things carelessly into Peter's suitcase, as the scene fades out. 
Part Six 
GORDON'S OFFICE fades in, and Gordon is at his desk as his secretary enters. 
SECRETARY 
Here's another wire from Peter Warne. 
GORDON 
Throw it in the basket. 
(as the secretary starts to do so) 
What's it say? 
(reading) 
"Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same." 
Gordon snatches the wire out of her hand and tears it viciously into bits. 
GORDON 
Collect? 
SECRETARY 
Yes. 
GORDON 
Don't accept any more. 
The scene dissolves to ANDREWS' NEW YORK OFFICEa richly appointed place, awe-inspiring in its dignified furnishings, which shriek of wealth. Andrews paces back and forth in back of his desk. Sitting before him is a man of fifty, with very rugged features. He is Lovington, head of the detective agency bearing his name. When the scene opens, Andrews is holding forth: 
ANDREWS 
Three days! Three whole days! And what have you accomplished! 
(in a close view at the desk) 
All you've shown me is a stack of feeble reports from those comical detectives of yours. I want action, Lovington! 
LOVINGTON 
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews. 
ANDREWS 
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found! 
LOVINGTON 
I've put extra men on, all along the way. 
ANDREWS 
It's not enough! 
(suddenly) 
Are you certain she's not with King Westley? 
LOVINGTON 
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about. 
ANDREWS 
(who has been pressing several buttons on his desk) 
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
(he is interrupted by the entrance of several employees) 
ONE OF THEM 
Yessir? 
ANDREWS 
(seeing them) 
Oh, Clarkwant you to arrange for a radio broadcastright awaycoast to coast hook-up! Offer a reward of ten thousand dollars for any information leading to her whereabouts. 
CLARK 
(leaving) 
Yessir. 
ANDREWS 
Brown 
BROWN 
Yessir? 
ANDREWS 
Send the story out to the newspapers. 
(he rips a picture of Ellie on the desk out of its frame)

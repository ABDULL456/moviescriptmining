WEST How 'bout some pants!? 
As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap... 
12   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            12 
General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift upwards... to the balcony where... 
ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS 
have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk. 
McGRATH I'm still waiting on my guns and ammo, but I see my men have brought your merchandise. 
McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods. 
McGRATH I had expected to be delivering it personally to Mr... 
Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name. The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English. 
HUDSON My employer, here in a brothel? (a small ironic smile) That would be quite... redundant. 
13   EXT. STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT                             13 
MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large, very striking woman in livery. 
As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer," DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a cat... 
14   INT. FAT-CAN'S - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT                   14 
HUDSON You'll meet him when the time -- and place -- are appropriate. Now... (stands) ... shall we go upstairs to check the 'merchandise'? 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 
McGRATH Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't planning to walk those oaken stairs with you. Direct me to the poot, sir. Something young and creamy. A gamer that takes to the crop and spur. 
McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath lays his rheumy eyes on... 
ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE 
She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs... a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again. 
EYE-CROSSED REB You drive a hard bargain, lady. All right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and... 
DORA Still not interested. 
She tries to pull away.    But the Reb won't let go. 
EYE-CROSSED REB But you gotta be interested. You're a whore. 
Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage. The falsetto becomes a baritone growl. 
DORA (baritone) That doesn't mean a girl can't have high standards. 
Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    Her corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    The Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground. 
Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig... 
15   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         15 
West is trying to get dressed. 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:                                                    15 
As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick. 
Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist -- which coldcocks the other guard. 
WEST Could I have a little privacy here? 
As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above, now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents. 
WEST Thank you. 
He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming Saloon Girl in his arms. 
WEST You'll have to excuse me, darlin'... but my evidence is getting away. 
West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked, THUNDERS past... 
CLOSEUP - WEST 
sails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his hat -- now on his head. 
WEST Sorry about there not being any towels. 
16   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            16 
General McGrath   leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls. Just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick at the thought,   suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a lollypop. 
McGRATH What's your name, missy? 
(CONTINUED) 
16   CONTINUED:                                                       16 
GORDON/DORA (demurely; back to his falsetto) Dora. Would you like to go upstairs? 
McGRATH Oh, indeedy I would.

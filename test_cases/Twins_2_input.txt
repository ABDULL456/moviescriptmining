Silence... 
MARNIE This mattress is just as bad as the other one. 
She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow, puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.

JULIUS Good night. 
Silence.     Marnie shivers, chattering her teeth. 
JULIUS Are you cold? 
MARNIE It's alright. JULIUS No, please, take my shirt.      I'm               * baking. Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she shivers. JULIUS You still cold? 
MARNIE Just my legs. 
Julius lies there, thinking about it. JULIUS Well, I could give you my... 
MARNIE (sitting up) Thanks. 
Julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and passes them over. Marnie puts them on under her blanket. 
JULIUS Anything else? MARNIE I'd love a glass of water. 
JULIUS (realizes that he's now nude) Right. 
He wraps his blanket around his waist, goes into the bathroom, comes out with a glass of water. He hands it to her. (CONTINUED)

She spills the water all over her top and bedding. MARNIE Oh, great! 
She starts stripping off everything she's wearing.      Julius averts his eyes. 
MARNIE Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet. 
JULIUS (gulps) No -- that would be okay. They both lie down under his blanket.      Silence... MARNIE Could we switch sides?   I like to sleep on the left. JULIUS Sure. She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye. MARNIE Can I ask you something for a change? JULIUS Anything. 
MARNIE Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit? 
JULIUS I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know. 
Marnie tenses, expecting the worst. MARNIE What? 
JULIUS (looking away) I'm a virgin. (CONTINUED)

146   INT. VINCE AND LINDA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                  146 Linda, dressed in a negligee, comes out of the bathroom area. Vince, wearing pajamas, is on the floor, legs curled under the bed, doing sit-ups. VINCE (under his breath; counting) -- Eighteen -- nineteen -- LINDA You sick or something? VINCE Julius gave me a few pointers -- (counting) -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first                       * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best. LINDA She'll love you whatever you look like.

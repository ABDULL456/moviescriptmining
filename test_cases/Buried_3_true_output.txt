PAUL No you don't! You people don't care about any of us. I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. We don't have any guns, any armor. Nothing. 
DAN You're not soldiers. 
PAUL Tell that to the people who put me in this box! Tell that to the people who shot my friends! 
DAN We're doing the best we can. 
PAUL No, you're not. All you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics. 
(MORE) 
PAUL (CONT'D) If I were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader -- or whatever your fancy title is, I'd be out of here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die. 
DAN I need you to stay focused, Paul. 
PAUL Fuck you. Dan's heard enough. 
DAN Paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary concern. Bottom line. And we're searching just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise. Paul does not respond at first. Dan's retort clearly has an effect on him. 
PAUL Who are they? The people who put me here? 
DAN They're just that -- people. No different from you and me. 
PAUL I'm no terrorist. 
DAN Neither are they. 
PAUL How do you know that? 
DAN If you were homeless, starving...actually, I take that back. If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them? 
PAUL I wouldn't kill someone. 
DAN How can you be sure? 
PAUL 
(GETTING FRUSTRATED) What difference does it make? 
DAN They're criminals, desperate ones at that. They don't care about anything other than getting the money. 
PAUL So pay them, then.

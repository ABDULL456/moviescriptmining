WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nWayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game. \nRANDY Hey, Wayne. Got a sec? \nWAYNE Not really. What? \nRANDY I was wondering if you had something more steady. Full-time. \nWAYNE Only thing I got right now's got weekends. \nRANDY That works. \nWAYNE Isn't that when you sit on other dudes' faces? \nRANDY What is it? \nWAYNE Deli counter. \nRandy seems a little hesitant. \nRANDY So, like, working with customers? \nWAYNE All day long, hot horny housewives begging for your meat.

SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY \nRandy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost thinking of leaving. \nCASSIDY (O.S.) Hey. \nRandy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees. \nRANDY Hey. \nRANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three inches shorter out of her stripper heels. \nThey shake hands, a bit awkwardly. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I almost didn't recognize you. You look all... clean. \nCASSIDY \"Clean\"? \nRANDY Like classy. \nCASSIDY Gee, thanks. \nRANDY Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it. (BEAT) It's like in \"Grease\", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards. \nCASSIDY Oh-kaay... \nRandy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels he's used to. \nRANDY So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam? \nShe gives the question genuine thought. \nCASSIDY Pam. (playful finger wag) But don't get used to it. \nINT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes. \nRANDY This is awesome... (rubs hands together, PSYCHED) We are gonna find something great! \nCassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc. She starts sifting through. \nCASSIDY Do you know her size? \nRANDY She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you. \nCassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it out. \nCASSIDY Could you see her in this? \nRANDY Maybe. (BEAT) Not really. (BEAT) I'm not sure. \nCassidy tosses it back in.

She can feel his sincere appreciation. \nCASSIDY You're welcome. \nShe returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift... \nRANDY I think she might be a lesbian. \nCassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Does that help? \nCassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the... \nMEN'S AREA: \nCassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a scrunched-up face. \nRANDY Ah, maybe she's just a friend. \nCassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something catches Randy's eye. \nRANDY (CONT'D) What's that? (POINTING) The green. \nCassidy holds up the item for Randy. \nCASSIDY (SURPRISED) This? \nAn excited look comes over Randy's face. \nRANDY It's perfect. \nRANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered on the left breast is a big \"S\" in purple script. It's UGLY. \nCassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful. \nShe looks at Randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride. She finds it very endearing. \nCASSIDY I agree. \nEXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER \nYesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission accomplished. \nRANDY Thanks again. \nCASSIDY You found it. \nRANDY I never woulda known about this place. \nCASSIDY Okay, I'll give you that. \nA tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) Look, I... \nRANDY Man, I worked up a pretty good thirst in there. What say we grab a beer? \nCASSIDY I gotta get going. \nRANDY One beer! We gotta re-hydrate! \nCassidy seems torn. \nCASSIDY I really can't. (BEAT) I got a kid at home. \nRANDY You have a kid? \nCassidy nods. Yup. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I had no idea. \nCassidy shrugs casually. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Boy or girl? \nCASSIDY Boy. Daniel. \nRANDY How old? \nCASSIDY Nine. \n", "test1_id": 2856, "test2_input": "WAYNE Just wear the fucking thing. \nWayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily. \nRandy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM. \nHe heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment, gathering himself like before a wrestling match. \nHe steps through. Showtime. \nINT. DELI COUNTER - DAY \nAbout 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with Take-A-Number tickets. \nRandy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign. \nRANDY Seventeen. \nA WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION in the case. \nWOMAN The Hudson Acres, are they all on sale or just the regular? \nRandy looks clueless. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) (holding up circular) It's a little unclear. \nShe hands the circular to Randy to take a look. \nRANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB. \nHe still has no idea. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if it's full price... \nRandy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG- HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact, embarrassed by the context. \nRANDY (to circular lady) Hang on, let me... \nRandy picks up a phone behind the counter. \nRANDY (CONT'D) (into phone, over SPEAKERS) Wayne, please come to the deli counter. \nHe cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers. He hangs up and returns to the customer. \nRANDY (CONT'D) It'll just be a minute. \nThe woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again. \nWOMAN Which in your opinion is the best smoked ham? \nRANDY I guess it depends what you like. \nWOMAN I tried the Apple Valley Farms once, and it was very salty. Do you find that? \nRandy steals a self-conscious glance at the party chick. \nINT. DELI COUNTER - LATER \nANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46. \nRANDY Forty-six. \nA WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46. \nWORKOUT WOMAN Could I get a half-pound of the pesto pasta salad? \nRANDY Sure. \nRandy grabs a plastic container. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Pesto change-o. \nThe woman smiles at Randy's little offhand pasta pun. This pleases him. \nRandy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container. He puts the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Wow. I am good. \nThis gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a price tag on the container. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Can I get you anything else? \nYOUNG WOMAN Nope. That's it. \nHe hands her the container. \nRANDY You have yourself a nice day. \nYOUNG WOMAN (friendly smile) I will. You, too. \nThe woman heads off.

But... \nHe excitedly hands her the present. She looks at it warily. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Open it. \nShe opens it. Inside is the green satin jacket. She holds it up, trying to process. \nRANDY (CONT'D) The \"S\" is for \"Stephanie\". \nSTEPHANIE Oh. Okay. \nShe looks at the jacket. It's nothing she would ever wear. \nRANDY I got it just for you. \nSTEPHANIE I see that. What's it for? \nRANDY No reason. Just because. Do you like it? \nSTEPHANIE I do. It's... shiny. \nShe looks at Randy. He is excited and proud. \nRANDY I was looking in this store and saw it, and I just said, \"That is it.\" \nStephanie nods, smiling politely. \nRANDY (CONT'D) So what are you doing now? \nSTEPHANIE What am I doing? \nRANDY Got any time? I was thinking we could swing by our old favorite spot. \nSTEPHANIE We have an old favorite spot? \nRANDY You'll remember when you see. Whaddaya say? \nSTEPHANIE Now's not the best time.

It's a charming little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It's a bit cold and not very crowded, still out of season. \nRANDY You really don't remember? \nSTEPHANIE No. \nRANDY Guess you were pretty young. \nThey walk for a stretch in silence. He points to a spot. \nRANDY (CONT'D) There used to be this funhouse.

Staring down at him from a white stucco   ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS FIREMAN with   a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled- up six pack.   Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE. \nRandy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED in a strange bed in a strange bedroom. His clothes lie on the floor next to a LARGE GLASS BONG. \nINT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, staggers into the KITCHEN. A ROOMMATE (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is pouring herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.

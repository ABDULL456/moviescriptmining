{"train": "THE WRESTLER \nWritten by \nRob Siegel \nDRAFT 10/14/07 \nFADE IN: \nMUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - \"ROCK ROCK (TILL YOU DROP)\" \nOver OPENING CREDITS, a montage of OLD WRESTLING-MAGAZINE PHOTOS. Action shots of RANDY \"THE RAM\" ROBINSON taking on a keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 20,000 screaming fans at Madison Square Garden. \nThe sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary: \n----\"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!\" \n----\"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!\" \n----\"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!\" \n----\"Ram absorbing tremendous punishment! How much more can he take?\" \n----\"Wait a minute... Look at this... The Ram is getting up!\" \n----\"He's coming back! I don't believe it!\" \n----\"Suplex!\" \n----\"Powerbomb!\" \n----\"Randy The Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! This is the very definition of heart!\" \n----\"Just listen to this crowd! The entire Garden, 20,000 people, are on their feet!\" \n----\"Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going wild... They know what's coming...\" \nA PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS. \n----\"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes...\" \nWe FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah. \n----\"Ram Jam! Lights out!!\" \nOver this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY. \nThe Def Leppard song rings out as we... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT \nPresent day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school. \nCHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER \nHe pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair. \nNaked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills with a beer. \nPromoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out. (a little sad) As always. \nHe hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D) Sorry. I was sure the gate'd be bigger. \nRandy just shrugs resignedly. \nEXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s. \nFAN #1 Yo, Ram. Think you could...? \nFan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up. \nRandy takes the program, happy to oblige. \nFAN #1 (CONT'D) I was there. \nRandy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER. The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging, crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the top, it says \"EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!\" \nFAN #2 (as Randy signs) My first match ever was you versus Davey Diamond at the Spectrum. (NOSTALGIC) \nRandy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood. \nFAN #2 (CONT'D) (vaguely sad) You were awesome. \nRandy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen. \nHe walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in. Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song. \nMUSIC: CINDERELLA - \"DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)\" \nRandy enters a suburban Shop-Rite. \nINT. SHOP-RITE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy sticks his head in a door marked MANAGER'S OFFICE. \nRANDY Hey, Wayne. \nINT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks up at Randy, irked. \nWAYNE Do we not know how to knock? \nWayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) Let's try that again. \nRandy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) Come in! \nRandy enters. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for you? \nRandy groans privately. He really hates Wayne. \nRANDY Do you have any extra shifts you could throw my way? \nWAYNE What's the matter, they raise the price of tights? \nRandy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) Let's see what we got. \nWayne starts flipping through. \nRANDY Pretty much anything weekday... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHOP-RITE - REAR LOADING DOCK - DAY \nRandy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK. \nHe carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OGDEN'S GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nRandy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small, liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand. \nANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the label is in SPANISH. \nGREGG I'm tellin' ya, bro, it's identical to the German. \nRANDY I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me bitch tits. \nGREGG Years ago, right? Mexican's way better now. \nRANDY I don't want this. \nGREGG Bro, it's the same. \nRANDY I want my German. \nGREGG I don't have any. \nRANDY Yeah? \nRandy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING AROUND. \nGREGG What are you doing? \nRandy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it. \nGREGG (CONT'D) That's my own stash. That's my last one. \nRandy puts the bottle of Mexican sustanon in the locker and walks off with the German. \nRANDY Danke schoen. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy, underwear pulled down, plunges a needle into his ass cheek. \nINT. GYM FLOOR - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes out one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on. \nSPOTTER Push it out----you got this! \nINT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER \nA strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who's on the phone. \nRandy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline gash. Nick Volpe wanders over. \nMEDIC Ram, man, you popped that crowd. \nRandy smiles contentedly. He sure did. \nNICK VOLPE (O.S.) Yo, Ram. Got a sec? \nNick Volpe comes over. \nRANDY For you, needledick? Always. \nNICK VOLPE Do you realize what's coming up? \nRandy looks at him, unsure. \nNICK VOLPE (CONT'D) May 6th... \nRandy racks his brains. He has no idea. \nNICK VOLPE (CONT'D) 20th anniversary of you and Ayatollah at the Garden. \nRANDY (AMAZED) Holy shit... \nNICK VOLPE I know. Time fuckin' flies. \nRandy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face. \nRANDY Whatcha thinkin'? \nNICK VOLPE Two words: Re. Match. \nRandy is instantly intrigued. \nNICK VOLPE (CONT'D) I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down in South Carolina that weekend. I wanna main-event it with you two. \nRANDY Yeah? \nNICK VOLPE Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time. \nRANDY Think Bob'd get back in there? He's pretty retired. \nNICK VOLPE For this? (cool, confident nod) I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban. \nRandy's mouth is practically watering. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER \nA spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier. Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman. \nBIG CHRIS Whassup, Ram? How ya been? \nRANDY Yo, Big Chris. \nThey chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight. \nBIG CHRIS (into Randy's ear) Hey, can you get me any more of that IGF-1? \nRANDY What do I look like, some fuckin' two-bit street dealer? \nBIG CHRIS C'mon, hook a brother up. You get the family discount. \nRANDY Swing by the mansion. Any day this week. \nBIG CHRIS You da man, Ram! \nINT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER \nMUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - \"STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY\" \nA crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer. \nRANDY Thanks, hon. \nRandy takes a swig, looking around the club. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Cassidy around? \nBARTENDER I think she's VIP-in'. \nRandy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the STAGE. He settles in at an open table. \nON STAGE: \nA YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to \"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song. \nRANDY: \nRandy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the stripper, like the song, crude and soulless. \nINT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nRandy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror. He primps a little. \nINT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRANDY We're talking one of the historic matches in history. 20,000 people. Another million and a half watching at home on pay-per-view. \nShe turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO. \nRANDY (CONT'D) We were going back and forth, just killin' each other for a half hour. Any wrestling fan, they know all about it. \nCASSIDY Million and a half? Shit. \nRANDY Yeah, it was big. So a rematch... (smiles, contemplating the PROSPECT) History all over again. \nCassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down, savoring her curves as she dances just for him. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Goddamn you are smokin'. \nCassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good. \n\"My Neck My Back\" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on. \nMUSIC: PITBULL - \"UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA\" \nThey look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Who knows. I put on a good show... \nCassidy nods supportively, sincerely. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Could be the thing that gets me back on top. \nCASSIDY You never know who's in that crowd. \nAn ALARMED LOOK comes over Cassidy's face. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) Jesus. \nRandy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) You're bleeding. \nA small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches. He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it. \nRANDY Got cut tonight. \nCASSIDY You okay? \nRANDY Ah, it's nothing. \nCASSIDY (small chuckle) And they say wrestling's fake. \nRandy proudly holds out his arm. \nRANDY How's this for fake? \nCASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep. \nCASSIDY What's that from? \nRANDY 1986. Denver Coliseum. Billy Bob Banjo hit me with his two-by-four. Loose nail tore the bicep open. \nCASSIDY Ow. Fuck. \nRANDY I got even better. \nHe pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE SCAR. \nRANDY (CONT'D) 1988. Orlando Arena. Mr. Magnificent tossed me out of the ring. Landed on my shoulder, clavicle snapped in half. \nCASSIDY Doesn't it hurt? \nRANDY (BLISSFUL) Not when they're going crazy for you... \nCassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the scar. \nCASSIDY \"He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we were healed.\" \nRandy contemplates the quote. He likes it. \nRANDY What's that? \nCASSIDY It's from \"Passion of the Christ\". (BEAT) You never seen it? \nRandy shrugs no. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) Dude, you gotta. It's amazing. \nShe sits down next to him again. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) It's, like, so inspiring. They throw everything at Him. Whips, arrows, rocks... Just beat the living fuck out of Him for the whole two hours. And He just takes it. \nRANDY Huh. I'll have to check it out. \nCassidy lightly traces a finger along Randy's bicep scar. \nCASSIDY The sacrificial Ram... \nThe Pitbull song ends. A new song begins. \nMUSIC: MOTLEY CRUE - \"GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS\" \nRandy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) From Elizabeth, New Jersey, weighing in at 218 pounds... The former WWF superstar and wrestling legend... The one, the only... (BEAT) Randy \"The Ram\" Robinnnnsonnnnn! \nTHE GYM: \nRandy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship. \nHe does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same. \nKids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He obliges as many as he possibly can. \nFans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in the opening montage.) He \"rams\" each one with his forehead. \nAC/DC If you want blood, You got it!/ If you want blood, You got it! \nHe does a lap around the perimeter of the ring, enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way. \nAC/DC (CONT'D) Blood on the streets, Blood on the rocks/ Blood in the gutter, Every last drop/ If you want blood, you got it!! \nRandy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee bends, limbering up. \nThe song fades down. A new song rises... \nMUSIC: CELTIC FROST - \"DOMAIN OF DECAY\" \nUgly, plodding HARDCORE DEATH METAL. \nANNOUNCER And his opponent: From Hampton, Virginia, weighing in at 295 pounds... \nThe boos begin to rain down. \nANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Hellbilly Cannibaaaal! \nThrough the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge, overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK. \nA TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK. \nHellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where Randy awaits. \nThey sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag. \nHellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of \"slaps\". \nAfter a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around the ring clutching his face, howling in agony. \nHellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE. Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube explodes with a pop. \nGrabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat. \nRandy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times. \nRandy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster. \nHe picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and crashes into Randy knee-first. \nHellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the concrete floor. \nHellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an exhilarated panic. \nHellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs. Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere. \nRandy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST. \nRandy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down. \nRandy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal, showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head into the can and falls on it, ass-first. \nRandy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET. \nWith the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand. \nPlopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table. \nHellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF. \nIn mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him. \nHellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet. Randy hits him with a dropkick. \nRandy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out. \nRandy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat. \nRandy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at the air. \nRANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They assume it's part of the act. \nHellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd. \nHELLBILLY CANNIBAL Is there a doctor? \nFew fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag. \nAmong those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy. \nJERRY DIFUSCO Randy. You okay? \nRANDY What if I do it moderate? I could hold back on certain moves. There's always ways to fake---- \nDR. TARACHANDANI Mr. Ramovic... \nRANDY (edgy glare) Randy. \nDR. TARACHANDANI Randy, a man with your heart should not be flying around a ring crashing into people. \nRandy's nostrils flare. \nRANDY With all due respect, Dr... (reads name tag, MISPRONOUNCING) ...Trachanani, I'd like a second opinion on that. \nDR. TARACHANDANI Of course. But I promise you, any doctor I showed your file would say the same thing. \nRandy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort. \nDR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D) You almost died. The next time, you won't be so lucky. \nRANDY I want a second opinion. \nDR. TARACHANDANI Your heart's been through a lot. Even before the heart attack, it was significantly---- \nRANDY I want a second opinion. (BEAT) I WANT A SECOND OPINION. \nINT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING \nRandy is checking out of the hospital. \nADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN This is your copy. \nThe ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds it up and stuffs it in a pocket. \nADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D) This was left for you. \nShe hands him a plain white ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside is a NOTE: \nYOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR! REST UP, FEEL BETTER. ----JERRY DIFUSCO PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS \nRandy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300. \nHe looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket. \nADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN (CONT'D) You have somebody picking you up? \nRANDY Yeah. \nEXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day. He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking around, a lost animal. \nEXT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER \nA CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the van. He gets in. \nINT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot, pondering his next move. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CVS PHARMACY - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy roams an aisle, killing time, idly browsing the selection of deodorants. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Robin Ramovic? \nRandy looks up. He heads down the aisle, toward the voice. He comes to the... \nPHARMACY COUNTER: \nA female PHARMACIST stands holding a small pharmacy bag. \nPHARMACIST Robin Ramovic? \nRandy heads toward her. \nPHARMACIST (CONT'D) Is that you? \nHe gives her a small, embarrassed nod, taking the bag. \nINT. PARADISE OAKS - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER \nRandy hands Len the manager a bunch of cash. Len notices he seems a little off. \nLEN THE MANAGER You alright? \nRANDY Yeah. \nEXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER \nLen removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door. \nLEN THE MANAGER Welcome home. \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER \nA messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen counter with the CVS bag. \nRANDY Don't you wanna get even? I whipped your butt. \nADAM That's okay. \nAdam gets up and scampers out of the trailer. \nRandy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words on the screen: \n1 PLAYER        2 PLAYER \nHe selects 1 PLAYER. \nA new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm. After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE CONTROLLER ASIDE. \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING JACK. He does another. A few more. \nHe feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart. \nHe starts to CRY. \nAngry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks. \nINT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT \nRandy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on. \nRandy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck. \nCASSIDY Hey, sweetie. You're back soon. \nRANDY Ah, I was just in the neighborhood. \nCassidy nods oh. \nRANDY (CONT'D) (\"CASUAL\") Hey, feel like maybe grabbing a burger? \nCassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they operate. \nCASSIDY I'm working. \nRANDY How `bout later, then? \nShe looks at him, puzzled. He seems off. \nCASSIDY You okay? \nRANDY Can we talk for a sec? \nCASSIDY Sure. What's up? \nRANDY Someplace more quiet. \nRandy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift, looks at him, a little gravely. \nCASSIDY Randy, I can't leave with a customer. \nPause. \nRANDY I had a heart attack. \nCASSIDY Shit. When? \nRANDY I needed to talk to somebody. \nCASSIDY You can't talk here? \nRANDY Just a couple minutes. \nCASSIDY Randy, I don't do that. \nRANDY Please. \nCassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in his eyes. \nCASSIDY Where are you parked? \nRANDY In back. \nAnother pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big. \nCASSIDY Go to your car. I'll meet you out there in 15 minutes. \nEXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER \nRandy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the passenger side. \nRANDY Thanks. I appreciate it. \nCASSIDY That's okay. \nShe looks at his vulnerable expression. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude. \nRandy nods. \nHis cheery expression fades. He is alone again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY \nRandy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO. \nRANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree. Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing, Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep. \nHe flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one. The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top, as if they've been written down over the course of years. \nEXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone cradled to his ear. \nSTEPHANIE'S VOICE This is Stephanie, you know what to do. (answering machine BEEP) \nRandy listens to the silence. He hangs up. \nINT. VAN - LATER \nRandy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle- class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to approach. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER \nRandy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself, he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T- SHIRT and PANTIES. \nRANDY (a little thrown) Hey... Is Stephanie home? \nThe woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is. \nTHE WOMAN Who can I say it is? \nRANDY Her father. \nShe disappears into the house. \nA few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Where you going? \nHe goes after her. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Stephanie! \nHe catches up. She stops. \nSTEPHANIE What do you want? \nRANDY Can we talk? \nSTEPHANIE Now's really not a good time. \nShe resumes walking, briskly. \nRANDY Wait! (chasing after her) Where ya going? \nHe looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT. \nRANDY (CONT'D) You in school? That's great. \nShe turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following. \nRANDY (CONT'D) What school? \nNo answer. \nRANDY (CONT'D) What school? \nSTEPHANIE Middlesex County Community. \nRANDY Middlesex? That's kind of a hike. Where's your car? (no response) You taking the bus? Lemme give you a lift. \nSTEPHANIE That's okay. \nRANDY It's no problem. (BEAT) Really. I'm parked right by. \nStephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him. \nRANDY (CONT'D) You're walking pretty fast there. You running late? (no answer) I could help you with that. (no answer) Give you a ride. \nShe keeps right on walking. \nRANDY (CONT'D) New Jersey Transit sucks! \nAnd walking. \nRANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D) The buses smell like piss! \nShe fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit. \nINT.

SEXXY, CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, CHRIS COLUMBO... AND MANY MORE! \nRANDY: \nRandy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read. \nRANDY Looks great. \nBrumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG Should get a pretty good crowd today. \nRandy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg. \nRANDY I'll start loosening up. \nBrumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour expression comes over his face. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER \nThe signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room, drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging wrestlers. \nON RANDY: \nRandy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill. \nFAN Thanks. \nRANDY You got it, broski. \nThe fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few ones and fives. \nRandy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over. \nINT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks around the room at the other wrestlers. \nRANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble stream of urine trickles into the bag. \nRandy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself from 20 years earlier. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG (O.S.) Sorry, man. \nRandy looks up and sees Brumberg. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT'D) I was sure the turnout'd be bigger. \nRandy shrugs resignedly. \nINT. VAN - LATER \nRandy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He pulls back out again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER \nMUSIC - LIL' KIM - \"HOW MANY LICKS?\" \nCassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm. \nCASSIDY Would you like a lapdance, sweetie? \nCUSTOMER That's okay. \nCassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans in to one of them. \nCASSIDY Would you like a lapdance? \nGUY #1 Not right now. \nShe looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask: \nGUY #2 I'm good. \nCassidy heads off, rejected. \nRANDY (O.S.) Hey. \nShe turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the string of no's. \nCASSIDY Hey. How ya feeling? \nRANDY Better. Good. \nShe leads him over to a table. They sit. \nCASSIDY How'd it go with your daughter? \nShe gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHOP-RITE - MORNING \nRandy knocks on Wayne's door. \nWAYNE (O.S.) Yeah? \nINT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nWayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game. \nRANDY Hey, Wayne. Got a sec? \nWAYNE Not really. What? \nRANDY I was wondering if you had something more steady. Full-time. \nWAYNE Only thing I got right now's got weekends. \nRANDY That works. \nWAYNE Isn't that when you sit on other dudes' faces? \nRANDY What is it? \nWAYNE Deli counter. \nRandy seems a little hesitant. \nRANDY So, like, working with customers? \nWAYNE All day long, hot horny housewives begging for your meat. (BEAT) And prepared salads. \nRandy thinks it over. \nRANDY That's the only thing you got? \nWAYNE At the moment. You interested? \nEXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY \nRandy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost thinking of leaving. \nCASSIDY (O.S.) Hey. \nRandy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees. \nRANDY Hey. \nRANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three inches shorter out of her stripper heels. \nThey shake hands, a bit awkwardly. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I almost didn't recognize you. You look all... clean. \nCASSIDY \"Clean\"? \nRANDY Like classy. \nCASSIDY Gee, thanks. \nRANDY Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it. (BEAT) It's like in \"Grease\", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards. \nCASSIDY Oh-kaay... \nRandy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels he's used to. \nRANDY So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam? \nShe gives the question genuine thought. \nCASSIDY Pam. (playful finger wag) But don't get used to it. \nINT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes. \nRANDY This is awesome... (rubs hands together, PSYCHED) We are gonna find something great! \nCassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc. She starts sifting through. \nCASSIDY Do you know her size? \nRANDY She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you. \nCassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it out. \nCASSIDY Could you see her in this? \nRANDY Maybe. (BEAT) Not really. (BEAT) I'm not sure. \nCassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style SWEATSHIRT. \nCASSIDY What about this? \nRANDY Wow... I had no friggin' idea. \nCASSIDY It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on. \nRandy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him. \nRANDY Wait. \nHe unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly, excitedly holds it out to Cassidy. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Now both our kids got something. \nShe looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it. \nRANDY (CONT'D) You're gonna turn this down, too? Man, you're rough! \nCassidy chuckles a little. She takes it. \nCASSIDY That's very nice of you. Thank you. \nRANDY Tell him to take good care of that. $300 bucks on eBay. \nCASSIDY Really? \nRANDY Nah. \nCassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his sweetness and earnestness. After a pause... \nCASSIDY One beer. \nINT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to the next one. \nRANDY He's a good-lookin' kid. \nCASSIDY I think so. \nRANDY I see where he gets it from. \nCassidy smiles, flattered. \nCASSIDY He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father. \nRandy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER- CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING. \nRANDY What's that? \nCASSIDY Just this condo thing, down by Trenton. \nRANDY You moving there? \nCASSIDY Working on it. (BEAT) It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome. \nRANDY What about Cheetah's? \nCASSIDY I'm done. I'm quitting. \nRANDY (a little disappointed) Oh. (nods to self) Okay... \nMUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - \"POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME\" \nRandy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Hell, yeah. \nHe stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't give it. \nRANDY (CONT'D) C'mon. Let's dance. \nCASSIDY Where? \nRANDY Right here. \nCASSIDY This isn't a dance place. \nRANDY Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep! \nCASSIDY (CHUCKLES) I've danced to this plenty. \nRANDY Fine. Then I'm dancing for you. \nRandy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a barstool. She smiles. \nCASSIDY Is this a lapdance I'm getting? \nRandy goes into lapdance mode, \"seductively\" writhing for her, silly and self-aware. \nRANDY Just sit back and enjoy. \nHe turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She laughs, charmed and amused. \nHe gazes into her eyes intensely. \nRANDY (CONT'D) The lapdancer has become the lapdanced. \nCassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed. \nWAYNE Just wear the fucking thing. \nWayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily. \nRandy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM. \nHe heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment, gathering himself like before a wrestling match. \nHe steps through. Showtime. \nINT. DELI COUNTER - DAY \nAbout 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with Take-A-Number tickets. \nRandy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign. \nRANDY Seventeen. \nA WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION in the case. \nWOMAN The Hudson Acres, are they all on sale or just the regular? \nRandy looks clueless. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) (holding up circular) It's a little unclear. \nShe hands the circular to Randy to take a look. \nRANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB. \nHe still has no idea. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if it's full price... \nRandy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG- HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact, embarrassed by the context. \nRANDY (to circular lady) Hang on, let me... \nRandy picks up a phone behind the counter. \nRANDY (CONT'D) (into phone, over SPEAKERS) Wayne, please come to the deli counter. \nHe cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers. He hangs up and returns to the customer. \nRANDY (CONT'D) It'll just be a minute. \nThe woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again. \nWOMAN Which in your opinion is the best smoked ham? \nRANDY I guess it depends what you like. \nWOMAN I tried the Apple Valley Farms once, and it was very salty. Do you find that? \nRandy steals a self-conscious glance at the party chick. \nINT. DELI COUNTER - LATER \nANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46. \nRANDY Forty-six. \nA WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46. \nWORKOUT WOMAN Could I get a half-pound of the pesto pasta salad? \nRANDY Sure. \nRandy grabs a plastic container. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Pesto change-o. \nThe woman smiles at Randy's little offhand pasta pun. This pleases him. \nRandy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container. He puts the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Wow. I am good. \nThis gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a price tag on the container. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Can I get you anything else? \nYOUNG WOMAN Nope. That's it. \nHe hands her the container. \nRANDY You have yourself a nice day. \nYOUNG WOMAN (friendly smile) I will. You, too. \nThe woman heads off. Randy's spirits are lifted by the exchange. \nINT. DELI COUNTER - LATER \nRandy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign: NOW SERVING: 57. \nRANDY O-57. \nRANDY You'd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg. I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that. \nSTEPHANIE I totally don't remember. \nRANDY (looks at her sweetly) I do. \nEXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and contemplative, not in his usual \"on\" mode. He takes a deep breath. \nRANDY I accept your apology. \nShe shoots him an irked look. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Not like that. I just mean... You made amends. I free you. \nHer expression softens. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Anything you've ever done or said or thought, I forgive. You've done nothing wrong to me. And anything I've ever done... (BEAT) I'm sorry. Truly. \nStephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you. \nRANDY I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road... I wasn't thinking about my kid. Or my wife. \nStephanie nods. \nRANDY (CONT'D) My priorities were all fucked up. I know that. But now... I wanna try to make things right. I wanna try to get to know you. (lump in throat) I just hope it's not too late. \nRandy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away before it has a chance to form. \nStephanie looks at him, moved. \nINT. BOARDWALK ARCADE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy and Stephanie play Skee-Ball side-by-side, father and daughter. \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping her off. \nRANDY Hope that wasn't too painful. \nSTEPHANIE It was okay. \nRANDY Well... \nRandy, unsure what to do, extends his hand. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Bye. \nThey shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug. \nSTEPHANIE Bye. \nAnother pause. \nRANDY So... How about dinner sometime? \nSTEPHANIE Dinner? \nRANDY Maybe Tuesday? \nStephanie thinks it over. \nSTEPHANIE I'm sorry. I don't think so. \nRANDY (nodding, \"casual\") Or not. That's cool, whatever... \nSTEPHANIE Wednesday would work better. \nRandy is surprised and happy. \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER \nRandy sticks the old Christmas photo of Stephanie and himself on the fridge. \nEXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - DAY \nRandy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with upcoming gigs. \nRANDY Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'? (BEAT) Good, good. (BEAT) Listen, you're gonna have to count me out for Utica. (momentous pause) I'm retiring. \nEXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER \nAnother call. \nRANDY Hey, how ya doin', Frank? (BEAT) Good, good. Listen... \nEXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER \nAnother call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer. \nRANDY Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to do it. (BEAT) I realize. I understand. (BEAT) No more. I'm done. I'm retired. (BEAT) Positive. It's time to move on. \nINT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT \nRandy scoops up his opponent again and SLAMS HIM TO THE MAT with another fancy move. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Powerbomb! \nThe song reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS: \nGUNS `N' ROSES Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! \nRandy joins in, pumping his fist. \nRANDY Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! Get in the ring! \nCUT TO: \nINT. NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES - DAY \nA strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall by the entrance are FLYERS for various events----card shows, autograph signings, etc. \nBehind the counter is promoter Scott Brumberg, scarfing down a sloppy Subway sub. The door opens. He looks up, smiling. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG Ram! \nRandy heads over and gives him a warm hello handclasp. \nRANDY Yo, Brummy. \nBrumberg pulls him in for a hug. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG How's tricks? Good to see ya, man. \nRANDY Yeah, good, good. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG So what brings ya by? \nRANDY Well... I was thinking about maybe doing a reffing gig. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG I thought you're retired. \nRANDY No wrestling, just reffing. Thought it might be fun. Shits `n' giggles. \nBrumberg, nodding, reaches down and grabs out a beat-up SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with old event flyers sticking out. \nSCOTT BRUMBERG See what we got... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER \nA high-school cafeteria. Randy is slipping into a REFEREE UNIFORM. Along the wall hangs a vinyl banner reading CAPW - CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING. \nBOOKER D (O.S.) Randy The Ref! \nRandy looks up and sees BOOKER D (30s), a big, black wrestler in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though not a pro like Randy, he's upper- tier indie circuit. Randy gives him a grin and handshake. \nRANDY `Sup, bro? \nBOOKER D Me and McPride was going over spots. We got this dope idea how to work you in. \nRANDY I really ain't lookin' to mix it up tonight. \nBOOKER D You're gonna love this. Check it out. So McPride---- \nRANDY That's okay. You guys do your thing. \nBooker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled. \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER \nBooker D lands on opponent SHAWN MCPRIDE with a BIG SUPLEX. He falls on top of McPride for the pin. Randy The Ref smacks the mat, counting. \nRANDY One!... Two!... \nMcPride kicks out. Booker D lifts up McPride. He hits him with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the ropes. Booker D goes after him. \nCAMERA STAYS ON RANDY'S FACE as he watches them wrestle off- screen. \nRandy's eyes are glued to the action... Punches. Kicks. Suplexes. Bodyslams. The crowd is going crazy. \nHe is tempted. Salivating almost. \nMore punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist any longer. He... \nJUMPS IN. \nRandy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D. \nRandy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - POST-MATCH \nRandy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING in the open shower area. They're on a post-match high. \nBOOKER D What a screwjob. \nALYSSA Oh, Gawddd... \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nWOMAN (O.S.) (through door) Could you please fuck someplace else? I gotta piss. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN. \nRANDY'S POV:   His eyes slowly open. Staring down at him from a white stucco   ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS FIREMAN with   a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled- up six pack.   Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE. \nRandy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED in a strange bed in a strange bedroom. His clothes lie on the floor next to a LARGE GLASS BONG. \nINT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, staggers into the KITCHEN. A ROOMMATE (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is pouring herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. She looks at Randy with a casual \"wassup\" head-nod. \nROOMMATE Alyssa's in the shower. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy emerges from Alyssa's building in the previous night's clothes, squinting at the blinding sunlight. \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy enters his trailer, chuckling amusedly. He tosses his keys on the table. \nHe heads over to the fridge and grabs a beer. As he closes the fridge, his expression changes. A look of DEEP DISMAY comes over his face. \nRANDY'S POV: The old photo of him and Stephanie on the fridge door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy rings the bell. Stephanie's \"friend\" answers the door. \nRANDY Hey. \nShe stares at him coldly and unnervingly. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Is Stephanie home? \nShe goes into the house, closing the door behind her. Randy stands there awkwardly, unsure what that meant. \nHe thinks about knocking but doesn't. He carefully turns the knob, leaning into the house. From somewhere inside, he hears the MUFFLED SOUND of Stephanie and The Friend talking. \nINT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nStephanie and The Friend are arguing in the living room. \nTHE FRIEND You don't have to go out there. You don't owe him shit. \nSTEPHANIE I know that. \nTHE FRIEND Then why would you even---- (looks up toward front DOOR) Who said you could come in? \nTHE FRIEND'S/STEPHANIE'S POV: Standing there is Randy, gazing guiltily at Stephanie. \nSTEPHANIE Please leave my house. \nRANDY I'm so, so sorry. I completely, TOTALLY---- \nTHE FRIEND Get the fuck out of here! \nSTEPHANIE (to The Friend) I can handle this. \nTHE FRIEND Obviously not. \nSTEPHANIE (teeth gritted) I can handle this, Jen. \nThe Friend, disgusted, grabs her coat and STORMS OFF out the front door. \nRandy and Stephanie are alone. She glares at him for what feels like a long time. \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) You're such a fucking asshole. \nRANDY I feel horrible. \nSTEPHANIE I waited in that restaurant two hours. Two fucking hours. Just in case you showed up late. \"Maybe he got stuck in traffic. Maybe I got the time wrong\"... (BEAT) Nope. \nRANDY I know I fucked up. I fucked up bad. \nSTEPHANIE You didn't fuck up. You are a fuck- up. A walking, living, breathing fuck-up. \nRANDY I'm trying to change. Really. I can't stand when I---- \nSTEPHANIE Just please shut the fuck up. Because I can't even stand the sound of your voice. (SEETHING) (MORE) \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) I thought about having a drink for the first time in 11 months last night. That's what you do to me. (BEAT) You asshole! \nShe grabs a SMALL POTTED PLANT off the table and THROWS IT AT HIM. It NARROWLY MISSES HIS HEAD, exploding against the wall. \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) Fucking piece-of-shit asshole! \nShe grabs a CAN OF SODA off the same table and THROWS IT. It NAILS HIM IN THE THIGH, exploding open on the floor. Soda sprays everywhere. \nRANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is THE AYATOLLAH (52). \nTHE AYATOLLAH That makes two in Columbus, one in Dayton. Next 12 months, I'd say Cincy's not out of the question. \nOTHER WRESTLER (not too interested) Wow... \nThe Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Ram-A-Lam. \nRandy heads over. \nRANDY (shakes Ayatollah's hand) What's up, Bob? (shakes other guy's hand) Yo, Carl. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Good to see ya, bro. Didn't think we were gonna do this. \nRANDY Yeah, well, I'm here. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Thursday night, I get a call, \"It's on! He's back in!\" I'm like \"What?\" \nThe Ayatollah chortles. \nRANDY When you get settled in, we should go over things. \nTHE AYATOLLAH What things? \nRANDY Y'know, the spots. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Ah, we can just wing it. \nRANDY You don't wanna hash it out? \nThe Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave. \nTHE AYATOLLAH It'll be fine. \nRANDY We should have at least a basic plan. \nTHE AYATOLLAH How's this: I'm the heel, you're the face. Done. \nThe Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed. \nTHE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (CONT'D) (to other wrestler) Anyway, if you're ever in Ohio, swing on by. I'll make you a nice deal on a G6. \nINT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER \nCassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window. \nCASSIDY Excuse me. \nA GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way. \nCASSIDY (CONT'D) Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is? \nINT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER \nThe card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc. \nRandy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes up his legs. His focus and intensity builds. \nEXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER \nCassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when Randy pulled in. \nINT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT TIME LATER \nThe building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE. \nCassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building. She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER \nRandy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls nearby. Randy catches his eyes. \nRANDY Ready to do this? \nThrough the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Believe so. \nThe Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close behind. \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) (through curtain) From the Islamic Republic of Iran, weighing in at 252 pounds... The Tehran Terror, the Beast Of The Middle East... (BEAT) The Ayaaa-tooo-laaaaaah! \nThe Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS. \nINT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS \nCassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him. \nCASSIDY Excuse me. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRandy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain, watching The Ayatollah make his entrance. \nTHE AYATOLLAH (O.S.) (faint, amidst the boos) Death to America! \nRandy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the loudest cheers yet. \nAs Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair. \nFans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but he doesn't hear them. \nThe Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The match is on. \nThe Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up and grabs The Ayatollah. \nThe Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot. \nRANDY (CONT'D) (under breath) You're workin' pretty light here. \nRandy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The Ayatollah's face into the canvas. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Jesus. Relax. \nRandy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his shoulder blades. The REF swoops in. \nREFEREE One!... Two!... \nThe Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock. \nRANDY Anytime you wanna join in. \nRandy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him with a FLYING ELBOW DROP. \nThe Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment. \nRandy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him. \nENTRANCE CURTAIN: \nCassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this. \nTHE RING: \nTHE AYATOLLAH That better? \nRANDY Much. \nThe Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes. Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee. Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah falls on top of him. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Forgot how much fun this is. \nThe ref swoops in. \nREFEREE One!... Two!... \nRandy KICKS OUT. As Randy \"recovers\", The Ayatollah jumps out of the ring and grabs a folding chair. \nThe Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against the metal barricade. \nENTRANCE CURTAIN: \nCassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little. \nTHE RING: \nThe Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy, kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it tauntingly at the crowd. \nFAN #1 (O.S.)                      FAN #2 (O.S.) Camelfucker!                       Fat piece of shit! \nThe Ayatollah looks down at Randy. \nTHE AYATOLLAH Pathetic. (\"spits\" on Randy) Pitiful godless infidel! \nTHE CROWD: \nBoos rain down on The Ayatollah. \nJUST OUTSIDE RING: \nThe Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain. \nThe Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND, fighting for breath. \nThe Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy by his hair and flings him back in the ring. \nTHE RING: \nThe Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat. \nENTRANCE CURTAIN: \nCassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring. \nCASSIDY Randy! \nTHE RING: \nThe Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly. \nTHE AYATOLLAH (under breath) Wanna take it home? \nRandy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction. \n", "test1_input": "RANDY What's up? \nSTEPHANIE I'm here because... \nStephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her. \nSTEPHANIE (CONT'D) I came to make amends. \nRANDY Amends? \nSTEPHANIE I'm supposed to talk to people I've hurt. \nRandy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in. \nRANDY Ohh... 12-stepper. \nSTEPHANIE (NODS) AA. \nRANDY Good for you. That's great. \nSTEPHANIE Thank you. I'm sure you mean that. \nRANDY I do. \nShe smile-nods insincerely. \nRANDY (CONT'D) So's that it? \nSTEPHANIE I need to apologize. \nRANDY For what? \nSTEPHANIE For anything I've done or said over the years. All the anger at you. \nRANDY Okay... \nSTEPHANIE Like the last time I saw you... I'm sorry for what I said. \nRANDY (dismissive wave) Don't worry about it. \nStephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at him with suspicion. \nSTEPHANIE Do you even know what I said? \nRANDY Sure. \nSTEPHANIE What did I say? \nRANDY It was about your mom. And me. (vague, flailing) Like, how I was bad. \nSTEPHANIE You have no idea. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Raa-am! \nRandy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed his way. \nMEATHEAD #1 Whassup, yo? Randy The Ram! \nMEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five. \nMEATHEAD #2 We gonna see some action tonight? \nRANDY (sly grin) Tonight's forecast calls for severe butt-whoopin's with a 100 percent chance of pain. \nPsyched \"Yeah!\"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it. \nMEATHEAD #1 Could we get a picture? \nRANDY No problemo. \nThe two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie, holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA. \nMEATHEAD #1 Think you could...? \nShe coldly takes it. \nSTEPHANIE No problemo. \nShe looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically, making his best \"Aaargh!\" wrestling face. \nStephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back. \nMEATHEAD #1 Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out there. \nRANDY You know it, broski! \nThe meatheads excitedly head off. \nRandy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at him with cold disgust. \nRANDY (CONT'D) What? \nSTEPHANIE Same shit. \nRANDY They're fans. \nSTEPHANIE Same old shit. \n", "test1_true": "STEPHANIE I'm in the middle of saying something important and you drop it for the fucking wrestling. \nRANDY I didn't ask them to come over. \nSTEPHANIE It's like I'm 10 all over again. \nRANDY Are we almost done with this? \nSTEPHANIE This what? \nRANDY This ATTACK. \nShe looks at him calmly. Sadly. \nSTEPHANIE Yeah. We're done. \nShe walks off. \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER \nRandy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick. Kid Loco falls to the canvas. \nRandy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers. \nDistracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN THE HEAD. Randy goes down. \nKid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest- to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him. \nKid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back. \nAs Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE TURNBUCKLE. \nRANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded cover. \nRandy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm. \nKid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the exposed metal post beneath. \nRandy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade along his hairline. No one sees it happen. \nBLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED. \nKid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again. Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts around the ring. \nKID LOCO Look at this loser! How pathetic. \nANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the Hulk. \nKid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super- charged. \nA look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is about to turn. \nRandy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the hair. He pulls him in close. \nRANDY (under breath) Let's go home. \nRandy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no. \nRandy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE DOWN with his feet over the ropes. \nRandy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again. \nKid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes. He scurries away. Randy goes after him. \nRandy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks. Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable. \nRandy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks out at the crowd. \nRANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting. \nTRIO Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!... \nRandy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads. \nWHOLE CROWD (O.S.) RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!... \nRandy \"mulls\" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks at the corner. He heads for the corner. \nRandy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd like he's still undecided. \nRANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation. \nRandy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening montage.) \nHe LEAPS. \nThe leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses. \nThe fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The money shot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAFETERIA - LATER \n", "test2_input": "A long, wounded pause from Randy. \nRANDY Yeah. (BEAT) I got it. \nHe takes a $20 out of his pocket, holding it out to her. \nCASSIDY What's that for? \nRANDY A lapdance. \nHe slides it across the bar to her. She slides it back. \nRANDY (CONT'D) You're refusing a customer? \nHe slides the $20 back to her. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Gimme a lapdance. \nShe slides it back again. \nRANDY (CONT'D) What? Am I a customer or not? \nHe waves the $20 tauntingly in her face. She pushes it away. \nCASSIDY Stop it. \nRANDY What's the matter? (no answer) Not in the mood? (no answer) So fake it. I'm just a stupid customer. \nHe tauntingly dangles the $20 in front of her again. \nCASSIDY Stop. \nRANDY It doesn't mean anything. \nShe looks away, trying to ignore him. \nRANDY (CONT'D) C'mon, give the customer a lapdance. Shake your tits. Smile. \nCASSIDY Fuck off. \nRANDY Pretend you like him. \nCASSIDY Fuck off. \nRANDY I want a lapdance. \nShe SWATS HIS HAND. The $20 falls to the floor. He picks it up and SLAMS IT on the bar. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I WANT A LAPDANCE! \nPeople turn and stare. Randy storms out of the club, humiliated. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY \nAbout 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER clutching Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter with a COWORKER, hands a WOMAN a packet of roast beef. \nRANDY Can I help who's next? \nAn OLD LADY steps forward. \nOLD LADY Pound of German potato salad, please. \nRandy grabs a container and starts scooping potato salad. He puts the container on the scale. It reads 1.06 LB. \nOLD LADY (CONT'D) A little less. \nRandy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale reads .96 LB. \nOLD LADY (CONT'D) A little more. \nRandy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.03. \nOLD LADY (CONT'D) A little less. \nRandy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes a tiny bit out. The scale reads 1.00. The lady nods in approval. \nRandy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it across the counter. \nRANDY Have a nice day. \nShe shuffles off with her potato salad. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Can I help who's next? \nA BLUE-COLLAR GUY (40s) steps forward. \nCUSTOMER Yeah, could I get a... \nThe guy does a DOUBLE-TAKE, noticing Randy's face. \nCUSTOMER (CONT'D) Do I know you from somewhere? \nRANDY I don't think so. \nThe guy studies Randy's face, trying hard to place it. \n", "test2_true": "RANDY Sorry, man. What can I getcha? \nCUSTOMER Half pound of Virginia ham and a half pound of the Jarlsberg. \nRandy reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. He brings it over to the slicer, his back turned away from the guy. \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D) I know we've met someplace. \nSlice, slice, slice, slice... \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D) You play softball? \nRANDY Nah. \nSlice, slice, slice, slice... \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) You're not one of Mikey Bosch's buddies, are you? \nRandy, shaking his head no, brings the sliced ham over to the weigh scale. The guy SNAPS HIS FINGERS. \nCUSTOMER (CONT'D) Wait a sec. \nHe looks at Randy, surprised and amazed. \nCUSTOMER (CONT'D) Randy The Ram? \nRandy stands there frozen. \nRANDY Huh? \nCUSTOMER The old wrestler. From the '80s. \nRandy, shrugging blankly, wraps up the ham and slaps a price sticker on. \nCUSTOMER (CONT'D) (forms Ram horns) Ram Jam! \nRandy grabs the Jarlsberg from the case and brings it over to the slicer. He starts slicing. \nCUSTOMER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Wow, that's freaky. You look just like the dude. Except older. \nANGLE ON the block of cheese as Randy slices. There's only a SMALL CHUNK left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and smaller. The cheese separating Randy's fingers from the blade grows thin. \nHe almost seems tempted. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT \nRandy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. \nON TV: \nAn NBA HIGHLIGHT CLIP of a FEROCIOUS DUNK. The crowd goes wild. The player roars as he runs back up court, full of macho swagger. \nRANDY: \nRandy's eyes drift downward toward his chest. He gazes at the still-fresh scar. Touches it tenderly. \nHe takes a big swig of wine, polishing off a bottle. He pops a cassette into the BOOMBOX on the floor. GUNS `N' ROSES - USE YOUR ILLUSION II. \nRandy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY... \nMUSIC: GUNS `N' ROSES - \"GET IN THE RING\" \nThe song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A chant begins: \nCROWD (ON THE SONG) Guns! And! Roses!... Guns! And! Roses!... \nRandy starts to prowl the floor like it's a wrestling ring before a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the song as if their cheers are for him. \nRANDY (cups hand to ear) What's that? \nRandy works the crowd. He points at a fan in the back row. Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs. \nRandy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the center of the ring. \nRANDY (CONT'D) (ANNOUNCER-LIKE) Folks, we are ready to rumble... \nThe song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro, kicks in. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK. \nRandy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground. \nRandy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched. He knocks his opponent down with a LEG SWEEP and pops up. \nRandy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops. \nRANDY (CONT'D) I've never seen such determination! \nRandy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Sleeper claw! \nRandy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his knees. He drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat. \nRANDY (CONT'D) Piledriver! (BEAT) Just listen to this place! \n", "test3_input": "Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him. Wayne takes Randy's arm and tries to lead him into the back, out of view. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) (conscious of customers WATCHING) Let's get that patched up. \nRandy roughly SHOVES him away. Wayne stumbles backwards. \nRandy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH. \nCustomers GASP. A woman SHRIEKS. \nRandy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT under each eye like WARPAINT. \nRANDY (striking wrestling pose) Let's get it onnn! \nWAYNE Somebody call the cops! \nRandy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened. Randy rumbles out of the deli area LAUGHING. \nSUPERMARKET AISLE: \nRandy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A SHOPPING CART, purposely \"over-dodging\" her so he CRASHES INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER SHOPPER, dramatically crashing into the shelves again. \nFRONT REGISTER AREA: \nRandy charges past the CASHIERS, out of the supermarket. \nINT.

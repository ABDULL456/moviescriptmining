TIM It's... Oh, who am I kidding, I'm a little scared here. A lot scared. But not about us. What we've got-- we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. I love you so much, Mil. 
He hugs her. Millie melts just a little, yet remains stern. 
MILLIE I want you to be very careful. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM I know. I will. I mean, Cedar Rapids-- there were only four homicides last year. For a city of 122-thousand that's pretty darn good. The forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but... 
She fidgets with his tie. A bitter tear skulks down her cheek. 
MILLIE I want you to check in with me. 
TIM I will every day. Twice a day. 
MILLIE Make it three times. 
TIM (LAUGHS) OK, three times! Sheesh. And I'll send a stinkin' telegram, too. 
Tim kisses the warm tears from Millie's ruddy cheeks. Millie licks her finger and smooths Tim's cowlick. Wade just sits there watching. 
EXT. RHINELANDER, WI REGIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 
Tim walks up to the tiny municipal airport. He tries the door. It's locked. A RETARDED MAN shoveling snow spots Tim. 
RETARDED MAN Airport don't open for two hours. 
TIM Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make my flight. Going down to Cedar Rapids. The big ASMI Convention? 
The retarded man nods vacantly and goes back to shoveling. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RHINELANDER, WI REGIONAL AIRPORT - LATER 
Tim is the first (and only) person in the security line. An apathetic TSA AGENT awaits him. Tim has a nervous energy. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
TIM Cold enough for you? I'm heading to Cedar Rapids. Supposed to be up in the mid-30s down there. S-weet! 
TSA AGENT Any liquids, gels or aerosols must be placed in a quart-size Zip-Lock. Laptop computers must be taken out of the case and placed in... 
TIM Whoa... what's all this now? 
TSA AGENT Any liquids, gels or aerosols... 
BILL KROGSTAD (O.S.) Tim! Praise Christ you haven't left yet. 
Bill Krogstad runs up to Tim. He's out of breath. 
TIM Hey Bill, what's going on? 
BILL KROGSTAD Can't believe I forgot to get this to you. Hang on, lemme... 
Krogstad puts his hands on his knees, takes a few deep breaths. Then he hands Tim a detailed handwritten checklist. 
BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) It's basically an ASMI Convention Bible. It's going to tell you who to talk to, who to avoid, how best to fellowship and network... 
Tim glances at the list, reads the only name under AVOID. 
TIM Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point. 
BILL KROGSTAD Ziegler is a cancer. Sonofabitch called one of Lemke's biggest clients-- Joyce Armbrüster? Smeared Roger's name and the Northlands' name. Frickin' poacher. Avoid Ziegler like the plague. The fella I got you rooming with, Ronald Wilkes-- that's who you stick by. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
By Ziegler's name, Tim frantically writes, "Poacher" and "Armbrüster--" making sure not to forget the umlaut. 
BILL KROGSTAD (CONT'D) You got the presentation, right? 
TIM Affirmative. 
Tim untucks his shirt, revealing a zippered cummerbund-like money belt. 
TIM (CONT'D) On me at all times. Plus three back- up discs. 
BILL KROGSTAD Hey-hey! That kind of prep is pure Lemke! Didn't know any better, I'd say Roger's spirit had kind of climbed into you, just planted its seed inside you there. Atta boy! 
High praise indeed. Tim hesitates. Is now the right time? 
TIM Bill... I have to ask. Let's say one of these big dogs-- your Allstates, your Prudentials-- does decide to go and buy Northlands...?

FADE IN... 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. 
It is winter in Ohio. A house sits isolated beside a barren field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch with a single door serves as the only entrance. 
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we; 
SUPER - OHIO, 1865 
WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards. 
CUT TO: 
INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN. 
C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY RUN DOWN THE STAIRS.. 
BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying a small bag of belongings. 
HOWARD We gonna need food. Wait here. 
Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front door, when suddenly; 
THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps away slowly. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAWN. 
Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table. 
He is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold - dropping the knife. 
INT. FRONT ENTRANCE - DAWN. 
Howard exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand; 
HOWARD Come on! 
DENVER (OS) Bul? 
The boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine year old DENVER. 
DENVER Where you goin? 
The brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. They love their sister. But there are stronger forces here. 
A MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle. 
HOWARD We gotta go! 
Bulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing. He wants to take her. 
HOWARD Bye, Denver. You take care. 
DENVER Bye? Bul? 
Bulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs his sister. He kisses her hard then breaks away. Denver's outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air. 
DENVER No..Bul... 
Bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding Howard's hand once more. 
Denver sits alone at the top of the stairs.  She sadly looks up and weeps, as if to the house itself: 
DENVER Now what you go and do that for? 
EXT. ROAD TO THE TRAIN - DAWN. 
THE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images of: 
The two boys running for their lives towards the train, holding hands all the way.  Howard is the first to reach it. As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in. Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him. 
C.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect. 
WIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town. 
On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD. 
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone is only one word: 
BELOVED. 
EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS. 
Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is too constant to notice. 
FADE OUT; 
FADE IN: 
INT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY. 
BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith. 
BABY SUGGS Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to see me some lavender. You got any lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do. 
Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around the room.. 
SETHE No. Sorry. 
BABY SUGGS Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color. 
Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until;

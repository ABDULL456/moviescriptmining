RAYMOND 
J&B? 
SAMI Glenmorangie. 
RAYMOND Glenmorangie is very good. 
Sami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something... anything... that will get his mind of the events that have lead them here. 
SAMI But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with you when we get back. 
Raymond forces a weak smile. Daniel who has been watching them grabs a few things off the table. 
DANIEL I'll be back in an hour. 
Daniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside. 
EXT. COTTAGE -- MORNING 
Sami steps outside.   Daniel is staring at him. 
SAMI What? 
DANIEL Can I trust you, Sami? 
SAMI Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room? 
DANIEL If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing. 
SAMI No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. 
DANIEL You haven't answered my question. 
SAMI Does it really matter what I say? 
DANIEL I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today. 
SAMI I will. 
DANIEL You better. 
EXT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- MORNING 
Daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell.   Half Tooth Tony opens the door and looks him up and down. 
HALF TOOTH TONY Yeah? 
DANIEL I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please. 
HALF TOOTH TONY Who the hell are you? 
DANIEL Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie Zammito. 
INT. BONANNO'S FOYER -- MORNING 
Half Tooth Tony searches Daniel. He finds a small cassette player, glances at it and sticks it back in Daniel's pocket. 
HALF TOOTH TONY (points to a door) In there. 
INT. BONANNO'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING 
Daniel enters. Half Tooth Tony stands behind him, his eyes locked on Daniel's every move. Bonanno is sitting in an armchair. 
BONANNO Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it? 
DANIEL I guess we're going to find out. 
BONANNO You rob an associate of mine... a friend and-- 
DANIEL (overlapping) Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket? 
Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony. 
HALF TOOTH TONY He's clean. 
Bonanno nods.   Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on. 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE Of course. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move. 
MAN'S VOICE We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here Frankie. We're talking about a boss. 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE Bonanno's a dinosaur. (More) 
ZAMMITO'S VOICE (Cont'd) Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your support? 
Daniel turns off the tape.   Bonanno's anger is visible.

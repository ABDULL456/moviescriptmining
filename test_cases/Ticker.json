{"train": "TICKER \nWritten by \nPaul B. Margolis \nOriginal Draft: 11/10/97 \n1   EXT.   METROPOLITAN CITY - DOWNTOWN - LATE NIGHT              1 \nHot summer night. The flesh district - hookers working the sidewalks, stopping cars. \nMIKE REILLY, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for action ... wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers, heat-seeking weary eyes. He flashes a wad of bills in an effort to get some attention... no one notices. \nAcross the street, BILL RICE, 50's, a ragged transient, strolls over. \nRICE Know what the problem is, kid?   You're too ugly to get propositioned. \nREILLY Look who's talking, old man. \nRICE C'mon, it's a quiet night. \nRice starts away.   Reilly pauses, then trudges after him. \n2   EXT.   SIDESTREET - NIGHT                                     2 \nRice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk with their mouths full as they walk. \nRICE Next week we work the park. \nREILLY I gotta get back on top.   Get off the sleaze detail. \nRICE You will, one day at a time.   I'll be old and grey when it happens... \nThey share a grin, pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac. \nBAG LADY A small gift, sir, for the Queen ... \nThe Pimp ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady pulls out a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice and Reilly. \nBAG LADY (cont.) I keep a record, see? They don't pay, I don't forget. \nRice fishes some change out of his pocket. \nRICE Here you go, your Highness. \nBAG LADY Thank you, officer. \nShe pushes her shopping cart away. Rice and Reilly look at each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop. \nREILLY So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch. \nRICE Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful. \nREILLY You don't fish. \nRICE How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping. \nREILLY You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway? \nRICE One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family. \nREILLY No thanks.   I got close but it never woulda worked. \nSWAN, 40s, crazy-brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men, pale, sweaty, wearing an EARRING, 30s, continue the barrage. \nSwan fires ONE SHOT at a time at Rice, deliberately aiming not to kill him, trying to flush Reilly out. \nRice screams as BULLETS RIP into his legs. Reilly tries to reach him but can't, shots forcing him back. \nA dark-eyed man with a BEARD appears in the b.g. and stealths towards Reilly from behind. \nReilly' face is in agony as Rice moans in pain. He glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to The Girl lying next to him -- what's keeping them there? Obviously The Girl. \nShe stirs. Desperate, Reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves his 9mm to her head. Using her as a shield, he drags her in front of Rice to protect him. \nREILLY (to gunmen) Drop it! \nSwan's eyes flare. He steps out into the open, gun aimed at Rice, eyes locked murderously on Reilly. \nSWAN Let her go. \nReilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling.   The Girl stiffens, terrified. \nBeard emerges behind Reilly. Deadly silent, he raises an automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines... \nSWAN (cont.) No, the girl! \nReilly whirls, sees Beard, shrinks back to stay covered. \nEARRING (to Swan) We gotta get outta here! \nREILLY (to Swan) Tell them to drop it - now! \nA deadly stalemate.   Faraway SIRENS WAIL. \nSWAN You have no idea how sorry you're going to be. (to The Girl) Don't worry. \nBeard smolders, Earring sweats. Keeping their guns up, the three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door and slip out. \nThe moment they're gone, Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl to a machine, kneels, cradles Rice. \nRICE Mike... \nREILLY Don't talk. \nRICE Take your time... one day at a time, kid... \nRice takes Reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch. \nRICE (cont.) It's all I got... it's yours. \nREILLY It don't work- \nRICE (grinning) Ain't that a shit-- \nRice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath. \nReilly winces, eyes welling up. His gaze moves at the Girl. \nThe Girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior ... \n5   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                            5 \nLooking numb, out of place, Rice's blood still on his trenchcoat, Reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked. \nCops look up, whisper about him. \n7   INT.   POLICE STATION - BASEMENT - DAY                          7 \nEmerging from a dingy back staircase, Reilly enters a hallway and moves to a door a door marked \"BOMB SQUAD.\" \n8   INT.   POLICE STATION - \"THE CAVE\" - DAY                        8 \nReilly enters into another world - a dungeon cluttered with bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping- pong table, Sheryl Crow pin-up, Chicago Bears posters, Yassir Arafat dartboard, a photo-shrine to dead Bomb Squaders. \nA plain, fresh-faced assistant, BEV, 30s, looks up from her computer station. \nBEV May I help you? \nREILLY I'm looking for the Bomb Squad. \nBEV They're not here. \nREILLY Where are they? \nBEV And you are...? \nREILLY Officer Reilly, vice. \nBEV There out on a call, perhaps I can help you- \nREILLY -Where? \nBEV 2600 block of Lakefront.   A limousine.   But, I- \nREILLY Thanks. \nReilly sprints out.   Bev tries to finish but he's gone. \n9    EXT.   CITY STREETS - DAY                                         9 \nThe Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic. \n10   EXT.   LAKEFRONT STREET - DAY                                  10 \nA young, uniformed police OFFICER stops Reilly in front of a cordoned-off section of the street. \nREILLY (flashes badge) Bomb Squad. \nThe Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way, Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through. \nThe Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and two squads cars. \nTwo OFFICERS stand near a building with a worried BUSINESSMAN and his CHAUFFEUR. \nReilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street. A Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson parked beyond it. \nReilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo \nPOOCH, 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo. Red rubber ball in hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an equally scruffy Labrador Retriever, SCHNOZ. \nPOOCH Smell anything, Schnoz?    Me, neither. \nT.J., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk. \nGLASS, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile, brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open driver's door. \nPOOCH (cont\u00edd) (cont.) Schnoz, come here, boy. \nT.J. Shhh, I hear something.... \nT.J. Make an appointment. \nREILLY It's about this. \nReilly holds up the bracelet.    Glass takes it, frowns. \nGLASS Where did you get this? \nREILLY Off a girl's wrist.    A suspect... \nT.J. P.E.T.N ... \nREILLY What? \nGLASS High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition. \nREILLY What do you mean? \nGlass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in. \nPOOCH Fire in the hole! \nGlass tosses it into a sewer drain. A beat, then a small EXPLOSION, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. The nearby Officers jump, alarmed. The Bomb Squad guys laugh. Glass waves to the Officers. \nGLASS Sorry about that. (to Reilly) That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do. \nREILLY Thanks. \nHe grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave. \nGLASS Hey wait a minute- \nReilly jogs back to his Studebaker, climbs in and roars off in a cloud of dirty smoke. \nT.J. Vice... Jesus. \nPOOCH That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on. \nPooch and T.J. share a laugh as Glass shakes his head, climbs on his Harley. The others pile into the van. \nGlass kicks-starts his hog and rumbles away, van following. \n12   INT.   BAR - DAY                                                  12 \nThin crowd of day-time drinkers. Earring walks in, moves to a booth where Swan and Beard are eating. Earring pulls out a Gallois (French) cigarette, lights up from a book of matches. \nEARRING They're holding her downtown. \nSWAN What about the cop? \nEarring shrugs. \nBEARD If you'd let me waste him. \nEARRING What if she talks? \nSWAN She won't. \nBEARD I say we split town. Come back to this job when things cool. We've got other contracts - Denver, Seattle... \nSwan slams his fist down, spilling food.     No one in bar even looks up from their drink. \nSWAN I want her back and we do the job. \nWINTERS Goddamit, Reilly-- \nREILLY Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them. \nWINTERS I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand? \nREILLY Yes, sir. \nReilly takes off, Pluchinsky glares. \n14   INT.   THE CAVE - DAY                                           14 \nT.J. is hunched over a twisted mess of wires, untangling them.   Pooch taste-tests dog biscuits for Schnoz, then feeds them to him, as he talks to his wife on the phone. \nGlass is dissecting the Mickey Mouse clock. \nPOOCH No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're welcome. You deserve flowers more often. \nBev glances longingly at T.J. as she gives Glass a neck rub. \nGLASS Bev, you're the greatest... \nT.J. Hey, I'm next. \nT.J. winks as Bev turns away, hard to get. \nReilly bursts in. \nBEV Hey, that's the guy- \nREILLY We just got a bomb threat upstairs. \nThis gets everyone's attention. \nREILLY (cont.) A cop was killed last night interrupting a robbery. One of the gang was grabbed, a girl. The one I told you about with the detonation cord. Well, her friends just called in, they're threatening to waste people unless she's released in the next hour. \nGLASS Alright, let's check it out. \nREILLY We can start in the area where the robbery occurred. \nT.J. Vice cop on a homicide? \nREILLY Captain assigned me to assist you. \nPOOCH Assist?   What the hell you know about tickers anyway? \nGLASS Easy, guys. (to Reilly) (MORE) \nGLASS (cont.) Look, nothing personal, but you can't just waltz in here and expect to join the team. \nREILLY What're you talking about? \nGLASS When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department. \nREILLY We've got one hour.     Are you coming or not? \nThe Squad just stands there. \nREILLY (cont.) Okay, fuck you. \nReilly walks out.   The guys look at each other.   Glass frowns at the bracelet. \nT.J. Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so pent up. \nGLASS Treat.    We treat devices. \nREILLY (amused) Anything else I should know? \nGLASS Don't push it, slick. \nSchnoz whines and paws at something under the beam.   They scramble over. \nT.J. Pooch, can you move it? \nPOOCH I don't know... \nPooch positions himself like a weight-lifter preparing to dead-lift. He growls as he strains to lift the beam out of the way. Glass and T.J. jump in and go to work with toothbrushes and tweezers. \nAs Reilly watches, fascinated, they uncover a scorched fragment of a briefcase handle. \nT.J. Yes, baby, yes ... \nPooch throws Schnoz the red ball. \nPOOCH Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you. \nT.J. Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty. \nReilly looks to Glass for an explanation. \nGLASS C4, plastic explosive. \nT.J. Helluva fuck factor. \nReilly again looks for an explanation. \nT.J. (cont.) Don't worry, you'll pick it up. \nPOOCH Hey, check this out? \nSomething glitters in the ashes. Pooch picks it up with tweezers. A tiny chip. The guys stare at it, puzzled. \nGLASS Lemme see that. \nGlass takes it, puts on his magnifying spectacles, holds it up to the light, frowns. \nGLASS (cont.) Hardware. \nT.J. Computer device? \nGLASS Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something. \nPooch and T.J. go back to searching. \nGLASS (cont.) What can you tell us about the girl with the exploding jewelry? \nGlass turns to see Reilly on his way out. \nREILLY I'll get back to you. \n25   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY                              25 \nPhones are ringing off the hook. Reilly bursts in, notices Winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated tracing equipment. \nWINTERS Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again. \nReilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by Pluchinsky. \nREILLY You remember me. \nReilly shuts the door, she doesn't respond. The Girl catches a glimpse of his 9mm under his trenchcoat, she's unfazed. He paces, circling her. \nREILLY (cont.) You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean off. \nThe Girl puts up a good front but we can see she's listening. \nREILLY (cont.) You're scared. You're just caught in the middle. But, we've got a guy out there wasting people just to get you back. Why? It can't be because of your looks. So, I'll be honest with you - \nReilly goes to the table, flicks off the mic. \n28   INT.   VIEWING BOOTH                                            28 \nThe Bored Cop doesn't notice, he's engrossed in his comic. \n29   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM                                       29 \nReilly sits, the Girl eyes him like a trapped prey. They're enemies, yet there's a strange chemistry between them. \nREILLY Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to happen. \nShe stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all. A flicker of fear, indecision. Her lips part, fighting it, then she looks away, letting the fear win. Reilly flushes with anger, frustration. \n30   INT.   THE CAVE - DAY                                           30 \nGlass squints through a microscope. Pooch sniffs and fumbles dirt samples. T.J. rocks to a Walkman as he inspects the charred briefcase handle fragment. Bev is at her computer searching luggage websites on the Net. \nReilly comes in, still frustrated. \nPOOCH We missed you, where'd you go? \nBefore Reilly can answer, T.J. rips off his headphones. \nT.J. Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here! \nPOOCH Awright!   How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking? \nThey all look over.   Glass stares back darkly. \nT.J. Glass, what is it? \nGLASS I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register. \nPOOCH Whadaya mean? \nGLASS It's from an IRA. \nPOOCH Oh shit... \nREILLY A what? \nT.J. IRA - instant retirement account. \nGLASS I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish? \nREILLY She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before? \nGLASS Only once, at Redstone. \nREILLY Where...? \nT.J. That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it. \nREILLY You mentioned something called Redstone. \nGLASS Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers. \nREILLY Cream of the crop, huh?   You? \nGLASS (nods) Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs. \nREILLY Sounds like terrorist heaven. \nGLASS There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course. \nREILLY Just how easy is it to build a... device? \nGLASS With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver? \nReilly looks at Glass strangely until he realizes they've stopped where Rice died. \nGLASS (cont.) So this is where it happened. \nReilly fights the memory... eyes well up, his hand trembles ever so slightly as he points out... \nREILLY Girl was here. The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there. \nGlass gets down on his hands and knees, scans the floor. Reilly talks to distract himself. \nREILLY (cont.) Bombers, what kettle of fish are they? \nGLASS Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers. \nREILLY Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along. \nGLASS No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage. \nGlass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a machine, picks up a half-smoked cigarette butt with tweezers, pulls it out, kneels. \nGLASS (cont.) Hello. \nGlass straightens it out, reads the brand name, \"Gallois\". \nGLASS (cont.) French. Doubt somebody who worked here smoked it. Only half gone, put it out in a hurry. (glances around) (MORE) \nGLASS (cont.) Figuring the length, assuming it was one of these guys, odds are... it was lit outside. \nGlass takes off.   Reilly follows. \n35   EXT.   MACHINE SHIP - GARAGE - AFTERNOON                         35 \nGlass and Reilly search the area.    Glass moves on his knees, aiming the flashlight. \nGLASS This is where the van was parked. \nREILLY Yep. \nGLASS Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ... \nREILLY Look, it's a longshot... \nGLASS Bingo! \nGlass pinches something with his tweezers, holds it up triumphantly... a used match. \nCLOSE UP - MATCH UNDER MICROSCOPE \nA busy Saturday afternoon crowd. Rock music blasts, reverberating with the echo of crashing balls and pins. The lanes are teeming with sweating bodies. Sexy waitresses in skimpy outfits deliver drinks. \nT.J. ogles women as they wander through. \nT.J. So what're we looking for? \nREILLY Someone who smokes French cigarettes. \nT.J. In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools. \nReilly and Glass nod, knowing it's a longshot. \nReilly directs Glass and T.J. to split up to case the place. \nThey move through the rowdy crowd, eyes catching every smoker. \n39   INT. BOWLING ALLEY - POOL ROOM/BAR - LATER                     39 \nThe music is more redneck-rock, the crowd as well. \nGlass and T.J. are in the midst of game of pool, nursing bottles of Root Beer. They continue to play while eyeing those coming and going. \nReilly enters from the alley, catches Glass' eye and shakes his head. He goes to the bar and orders a coke. \nHe takes the drink and moves over next to Glass as T.J. lines up a shot. \nGLASS How long are we going to stay? \nREILLY `Til we get a better lead. \nReilly's attention is drawn to a crowded booth in the corner where a few bowling alley girls block the view of the entire booth. \nGlass nudges Reilly, they look over to see Pooch entering the bar. He sees them and moves to the bar. T.J. sinks his shot and lines up another as Reilly and Glass move to meet Pooch. \nPooch produces a printout from his jacket, opens it up. \nPOOCH Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match \nREILLY Insurance? \nGLASS Political. \nPOOCH Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies.   Some insured, some not. (MORE) \nPOOCH (cont.) But there's traces of C4 and assorted inflammatory additives found in each case. The only common denominator is the detonators all had circuitry consistent with our micro- chip. \nGLASS Not bad for Bomb squad, eh? \nREILLY What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked. \nGLASS Right. \nREILLY Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago. \nPOOCH I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here. Bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too. \nT.J. comes over. \nT.J. Pooch, you're up.    Rack `em. \nThey look over to the pool table to see only the cue ball left. \nT.J. (cont.) Boss, you're buying the next round. \nPooch scribbles down an address on a scrap of paper from the device's shopping bag, hands it to Reilly, offering a smile. \nPOOCH In case you change your mind. \nReilly looks at it awkwardly, then walks away as a News van arrives on the scene... \n43   EXT./INT. DOWNTOWN - STUDEBAKER - EARLY EVENING                43 \nReilly cruises into the bowels of downtown.    Makes a few turns and parks. \nIn the shadows of a burned out building, Reilly observes several JUNKIES getting a fix from their CONNECTION. \nReilly watches with scared, tempted eyes. \nHe looks at his hands... they're trembling... catches his reflection in the rear view mirror. Checks Rice's watches on his wrist, taps it. Still not ticking. Ashamed, he screeches away. \n44   INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT                           44 \nA quiet Squad Room. Reilly bangs out something on a computer terminal. He blazes away, typing as fast as he can. He holds out his hands. Almost steady. He takes a drink from a Protein Shake, returns to typing. \n45   INT.   WINTERS' OFFICE - NIGHT                                 45 \nA weary Winters looks up from coffee and paperwork as Reilly knocks, walks in. Reilly drops a sheaf of papers on his desk. \nWINTERS What's this? \nREILLY Report on the case so far. \nWINTERS You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean. \nREILLY Yes, sir. \nWINTERS But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it? \nReilly nods, accepting. \nWINTERS (cont.) I imagine as soon as they find out one of their's is dead, we'll be getting another call. So get some sleep, alright. \nReilly nods, turns and exits. \n46   INT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT                           46 \nTIGHT on a TV - a pretty Reporter reports live from the scene... \nREPORTER To recap, a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago. \nTHE ROOM \nSwan watches the TV report with Beard, eyes narrowing as he sees Reilly in the crowd behind the Reporter. \nREPORTER (cont.) While the man's motives and identity remain a mystery, police are denying the incident is related to the explosion that ripped through a bar earlier today, killing 15 and wounding more than 30... \nSwan kicks in the TV, destroying it. \nBEARD She talked. \nSwan flips open a suitcase full of bomb-making materials and begins to sort through... \n47   EXT.   POOCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   47 \nQuiet, cozy, middle class. The Harley and the Bomb Squad van are parked out front. Also the Studebaker. \n48   INT.   POOCH'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         48 \nReilly throws Glass a surprised look. \n49   EXT.   POOCH'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING                           49 \nSunrise breaking. Reilly and Glass have their heads under the hood of the Studebaker, covered in grease, tools everywhere. T.J. sits behind the wheel. Pooch and Schnoz stumble out of the house to watch. \nREILLY Okay, hit it. \nT.J. guns the engine, the Studebaker purrs like a tiger. \nGLASS Alright! \nT.J. We've created a monster. \nGlass glances at Pooch. \nGLASS Any word? \nPOOCH Nothing.    Maybe they gave up, split town. \nREILLY Don't bet on it. \n50   EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING                                   50 \nBustling activity... \n51   INT. THE CAVE - MORNING                                         51 \nReilly enters to find Glass, Bev, T.J. and Pooch busy at work at each of their work stations. Glass moves over to watch Bev's computer screen. \nREILLY How's the print coming? \nBEV One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol. \nREILLY Damn. \nBev enters another command... the computer goes to work as she turns to Reilly. \nBEV Coffee, Mike? \nREILLY No thanks, Bev. \nShe smiles warmly. He smiles back, T.J. eyes them, slightly jealous of the moment. \nA phone rings.   Bev answers it... \nBEV Yes, sir.   He's here.   I'll tell him. \nBev hangs up the phone. \nBEV (cont.) Mike, Captain wants to see you right away. \nReilly heads for the door. \n52   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                            52 \nA strange, uncomfortable silence hangs over the squad room as Reilly weaves past cops smoking, drinking coffee, waiting. They all stare at him. Especially Pluchinsky. \n53   INT.   WINTERS' OFFICE - MORNING                                53 \nReilly walks in. Winters gestures for him to take a seat as he talks on the phone. \nWINTERS Yes ... no, of course not but ... yes, sir, I understand. \nReilly rises and moves to her.   Their eyes linger a moment, a bond between them. \nREILLY Then why tell me? \nMARY People are dying. \nReilly nods and touches her shoulder, a light squeeze.   He turns and exits. \n55   EXT.   SUNCREST MOTEL - ROOM 138 - DAY                           55 \nAn army of cops and squad cars out front, Pluchinsky silently directs a SWAT team to the door. Reilly and the Bomb Squad watch from a distance as they break down the door. \nSHOUTING, mayhem as the team floods into the room. Pluchinsky brings up the rear. After a beat, Pluchinsky re- emerges, shaking his head. \nAT THE FAR END OF THE MOTEL \nSwan and Beard watch from behind a car. Beard gives Swan a dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner. \nAT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN \nReilly and Glass are visibly disappointed. \nAs the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a MAN getting into his car. The Man ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady scribbles down his license number in her pad. Glass follows Reilly's stare. \nGLASS Ex-girlfriend? \nREILLY Be right back. \nReilly crosses the street, intercepts the Bag Lady as she's pushing her cart away. \nREILLY (cont.) Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were staying at the hotel over there - one has a beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't happen to have seen them, would you? \nBAG LADY No. \nREILLY No, of course not... well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness. \nHe fishes some change out of his pocket, hands it over, starts away. \nBAG LADY On second thought, maybe I did. \nHe turns back. The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an entry with her finger. \nBAG LADY Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this morning. Very disrespectful. He used to drive a van, but he got a new car. You want the license number? \nShe tears off the page, holds it out. \nREILLY You're beautiful! \nReilly gives her a big kiss, races back to the Bomb Squad who've been watching. \nREILLY We're back in business! \nThey all look at him like he's nuts. \n56   INT.   POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY                                56 \nBuzzing with action.   Harry and Pluchinsky attack Winters with printouts. \nHARRY Ran the license plate - car was rented early this morning from a Hertz office downtown. \nPLUCHINSKY Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in half a dozen countries. \nWINTERS Get out an APB, now! \nBeard speeds around another corner, the lumbering Van has difficulty keeping up and loses sight of the Grenada for a moment. \n66   EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY                                       66 \nThe Grenada speeds up, heading towards the Police Station up ahead. \nThe Bomb Squad Van appears and speeds up. \nON THE SIDEWALK \nSwan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as... \nON THE STREET \nBeard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station - on collision course. At the last second, Beard dives from the moving car, hits the pavements and rolls. \nThe Grenada CRASHES into the Squad Car... but no explosion. \nThe Bomb Squad Van SKIDS to a stop as two uniformed Officers rush out of the Station. \nBeard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down the street. \nPooch and T.J. jump out of the Van (leaving a BARKING Schnoz inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn. Pooch is quickly huffing and puffing. T.J. continues after Beard as Pooch moves towards the Grenada. The uniforms follow T.J. \nGlass on his Harley appears from behind the Van. At the far end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed by a Squad Car, lights flashing. Everyone closing in on Beard. \nT.J. aims and yells at Beard. \nT.J. Police, freeze! \nBeard whirls around, SPRAYING automatic weapon FIRE at T.J. and the Uniforms - they hit the pavement. \nA few nearby Pedestrians SCREAM and drop to the ground. \nReilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his FIRE on him, BLOWING OUT his windshield. \nBack at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open driver's door. \nGlass runs his Harley behind a parked car. \nThe Squad Car behind Reilly SKIDS to a stop and as Beard shifts his aim, T.J. and Reilly each PUMP TWO SHOTS into Beard's torso. \nBeard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street. Relief all around. Everyone stands back up. T.J.'s jaw drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with his bullets. \nAT THE GRENADA \nPooch exhales in relief, then hears BEEPING coming from the front seat of the car. He looks in to see the briefcase open, countdown ticking away. \nPOOCH Oh... damn. \nKA-BOOOOOM!!! \nThe Grenada explodes in a massive FIRE-BALL, throwing nearby Glass off his feet. Everyone else drops back to the ground, covering their heads. \nDOWN THE STREET - AT THE PHONE BOOTH \nSwan grins and walks away down an alley. \nWe can hear the CRY of Schnoz, WAILING from the front seat of Van. \n67   INT.   POLICE STATION - WINTERS' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING         67 \nReilly stares off into space. Surreal silence, like a dream... Reilly looks at his watch, keeps his eyes low as he steals a glance at Glass in the other chair, face wracked with pain, loss. \nThen just as Swan whooshes out, a charge EXPLODES a stack of 55 gallon drums. They fall down into the path of the pursuers who crash into the FLAMING DRUMS. \nThe lead car EXPLODES... \n83   EXT./INT. STREET - CAMERO - MOVING - DAY                       83 \nMary looks back in horror as she's whisked away. \n84   INT.

BACK HALLWAY                                            85 \nDrunk, dejected, looking like shit, Reilly waits for a fix with a couple other JUNKIES. The TV in the bar drones in the background. \nThe Dealer appears and gestures to Reilly. \nDEALER C'mon, cowboy, you're next. \nReilly trudges over. \nDEALER Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White, Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl... \nReilly looks up sharply as he hears the TV, visible through the doorway. \nREPORTER ON TV We're coming to you live near the scene of that latest, explosion that ripped through a downtown alley less than half an hour ago. \nSomething clears behind Reilly' eyes. \nDEALER (impatient) Hey, asshole ... \nREPORTER ON TV Despite growing fears and talk of a coverup, police have sealed off the area and are refusing to comment about fatalities, or the rumor that terrorists may be involved. \nReilly's eyes shift, mind racing. \nDEALER Hey, I'm talking to you-- \nSuddenly himself again, Reilly bolts up, sending the Dealer and his equipment scattering, and streaks off. He bursts out of the front door of the bar into the glare of sunlight... we can hear SIRENS not too far off. \n86   INT.   STUDEBAKER - MOVING - DAY                                86 \nDriving like a maniac as usual, Reilly grabs the radio mike with one hand, pulls his back-up .357 out of the glove-box. \nHe listens out the window for the SIRENS, he looks up at the sound of approaching HELICOPTERS. \n87   EXT.   GAS STATION - DAY                                        87 \nIn the service bay, a MECHANIC raises the black Camaro on a hydraulic lift, out of sight from the street. \nOut front, Swan pays an ATTENDANT, climbs into an orange U- Haul truck with Mary, drives off. \nA beat, a squad car and an unmarked speed past the Gas Station. \n88   EXT./INT.   STREETS - U-HAUL - MOVING                          88 \nSwan brushes Mary's hair from her face. \nSWAN You hungry?     We could get something to eat. \nMary shakes her head, scared. \nSWAN What's the matter? \nSwan grabs Mary, dragging her with him.   A pair of TEENAGE BOYS on skateboards notice, veer over. \nBOY Hey--? \nSwan whips out his Mac-11. The Boys skate for cover as Swan drags Mary back to the U-Haul. \nThe open back door reveals a number of 55 gallon drums, some boxes and two milk crates of C4. He SLAMS down the sliding door, moves around front and shoves Mary inside. \n90   INT.   STUDEBAKER - MOVING - DAY                                90 \nCaught in traffic, map spread out in his lap, Reilly slams on his horn. \nREILLY C'mon, move it. \nHis police radio crackles. \nDISPATCHER VOICE All units, 211 reported at 8th and Sycamore. Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an automatic weapon, last seen heading east with female hostage in a U-Haul truck ... \nReilly perks up, checks his map. \nJamming the wheel, he crashes out of traffic, ripping the bumper off the car in front of him, and rockets away. \nHe grabs his mic, thinks, disguises his voice. \nREILLY Dispatch, this is Reilly. \nDISPATCHER VOICE Go ahead. \nREILLY Patch me through to the Bomb Squad. \nDISPATCHER VOICE Aren't you on suspension? \nREILLY Just do it. \nDISPATCHER VOICE Hang on. \nReilly runs a red. \nT.J.'S VOICE T.J. here. \nREILLY T.J., it's Reilly, put Glass on! \n91   EXT./INT. STREET - BOMB SQUAD VAN - MOVING - DAY            91 \nT.J. is in the passenger seat, Bev sits in the back with Schnoz, Glass drives. Glass takes the mic. \nGLASS What's up? \nINTERCUT WITH REILLY \nREILLY Where you guys at? \nGLASS Driving in circles, waiting for- \nREILLY Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul. \nGLASS How do you know? \nREILLY Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town. \nGLASS Should we head for the Interstate? \nREILLY Would you? \nREILLY (into mic) We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up! \nReilly throws done the mic, takes aim again. \nTHE U-HAUL \nidles.   Swan's rage erupts.       He climbs out with Mary in tow. \nALLEY \nReilly aims carefully... \nSwan keeps his Mac-11 to Mary's head. Reilly is frozen by the move. Swan backs to the rear of the van. He slides up the door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad. He reaches in and grabs a remote control. \nSIRENS are coming closer, only a block or two away... \nAT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN \nGlass and T.J. drop their jaws.       They see Swan depress the remote, arming the explosives. \nT.J. Jesus... \nGLASS Reilly!    He's loaded! \nALLEY \nREILLY (yelling) Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit! \nSWAN I want out, right now.      Or the whole city block is gone. \nGLASS Reilly, he's got enough to do it. \nReilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the side of the alley, escaping Swan's view. \nSwan rages.   He moves around the van, pulling Mary along. \nSwan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his face. \nSwan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces, having been hit in the shoulder. \nReilly moves forward about to take the shot. \nGLASS (cont.) Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch. He releases it, we're done for. \nSwan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat. \nSWAN Drop it. \nMARY (to Reilly) Take him! \nMary jerks away from Swan. \nReilly fast FIRES. \nSwan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the detonator... \nMary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him. \nReilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling, bleeding Mary. \nShe clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the remote. \nReilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she looks up into his eyes--distraught. \nDeeper, deeper. \nAT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN \nThe SWAT Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out, the SWAT Team is about to follow- \nT.J. Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're chilling a device. \nWinters looks to the action at the U-Haul, sees Reilly and Glass busy at work. He nods at Benson. \nFinally Reilly' fingers touch a button object. We hear the SWAT Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley. \nREILLY Something round, two wires ... \nGLASS That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... \nREILLY What's wrong? \nGLASS Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. \nREILLY Make up your mind, trigger. \nGLASS Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything? \nReilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around... \nREILLY Yeah, another round thing. \nGLASS Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. \nREILLY Which one's which? \nGLASS I don't know. \nREILLY What... ? \nGLASS When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. \nREILLY How the hell do you feel yellow? \nGLASS No excuses, just do it! \n10... Reilly glares at Glass. \n9... His face is dripping with sweat. \n8... His fingers shift back to the first cap. \n7... They close over it, ready to pull. \n6... But then they stop. \n5... Reilly frowns. \n4... Glass stabs him with a look. \n3... 2... Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank the second cap out of its base. \nThe counter stops.    0:01. \nReilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath, hardly daring to believe it's true. They whoop and explode with relief. \nIt's over... it's finally over. \n", "test1_input": "Earring walks out and strolls off. He checks his watch, picks up the pace. He disappears around a corner. \nCars pass.   People stroll by.   Nothing happens. \nAn ordinary scene on an ordinary day.     The silence is screaming. \nSuddenly - the bar EXPLODES. A FIREBALL BURSTS OUT the front window, showering the street with wood and BROKEN GLASS. \n22   EXT.   BAR - DAY - LATER                                          22 \nChaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red lights. Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up, Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances. \nA black-and-white tears up. Capt. Winters leaps out, pushes through to a dirt-covered FIRE CHIEF. \nFIRE CHIEF Eight dead, so far. \nWinters looks grim. \n23   AT THE BARRICADE                                                  23 \nReilly SCREECHES up in his Studebaker, jumps out, pushes through, flashes his badge, enters the police zone. \nHe stops as he sees a bloody FEMALE VICTIM being loaded into an ambulance. Suddenly a voice snaps him out of it. \nPLUCHINSKY What're you doing here? \nReilly faces him. \nPLUCHINSKY (cont.) You're offsides. Beat it. \nReilly ignores them, starts towards the ruins.    Pluchinsky shoves him back. \nPLUCHINSKY (cont.) I said get the fuck outta here. \nREILLY You touch me again and-- \nPLUCHINSKY And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece. \nPluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in the face. Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his bleeding nose. Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts at him. They exchange a few body shots before several cops swarm in and pull them apart. \nWinters hustles over. \nWINTERS What the hell's going on? \nPLUCHINSKY Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...   This fuck-up is interfering with- \nWINTERS Reilly, what're you doing here? \nREILLY Sir... \nWINTERS I thought I told you-- \nGLASS (O.C.) He's with us. \nThey all turn. \nGlass and T.J. stand there, soot-smeared, wearing utility belts. \nGLASS (cont.) We asked him to come. \nT.J. Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing. \nGLASS Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. (to Reilly) Coming? \n", "test1_true": "WINTERS Go ahead, kid. \nReilly marches after Glass and T.J., leaving Pluchinsky fuming, holding closed his bloody nose. \nPLUCHINSKY I'm filing charges against that mother- \nWINTERS Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose. \nANGLE - ON THE BOMB SQUAD \nReilly follows Glass and T.J., bewildered. \nREILLY What was-?   Why...? \nGLASS That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner. \nT.J. We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like. \nGLASS Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives. \nREILLY What? \nGLASS This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand? \nREILLY Now wait just a fucking- \nGLASS Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive. \nReilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage. \n24   INT.   PUB - DAY                                               24 \nSmoky hell. Two Firemen drag out a fire hose. Glass, T.J. and Reilly approach a taped-off area where Pooch is on his hands and knees, wet and dirty as he searchs for clues. Schnoz sits nearby, red ball in his mouth. \nGLASS By the way, I'm Glass.   This is T.J., and Pooch. \nREILLY Mike Reilly. \nT.J. (offering dirty hand) Uh-huh... \nReilly avoids the hand. \nPOOCH That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie. \nSchnoz ignores them, sniffing a charred beam in a corner. \nT.J. points out burn patterns to Glass. \nT.J. Flame racer, partial P.C.L. See this wave pattern? Definitely self-contained. \nPooch sniffs dirt, tastes it. \nPOOCH Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ... \nREILLY What kind of bomb was it? \nT.J.

Bad luck. \nREILLY So you're the \"Device Squad\"... and you defuse \"devices\"? \n", "test2_input": "Reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian--and fires. \nEarring is blown off his feet... \nHe hits the pavement hard... \n41   INT.

He pushes his way through the bar patrons to the booth. \nGlass glances up at Reilly. \nGLASS He set one, the son-of-a... \nTJ and Pooch exchange looks--they've never heard Glass so close to swearing before. \nT.J. notices a small crowd starting to gather around the booth. \nT.J. (calmly) Clear the area, please. \nNobody moves. \nREILLY (loudly) You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb! \nThat does it, the crowds shriek and scatter. \nRolling eyes at each other, the Bomb Squaders turn their attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor. \nGLASS Alright.   Let's assess. \nThe team eyes the package for a moment... \nGlass makes a determination, whips out a knife, slashes the bag open, revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb inside.   T.J. rubs his temples with dread. \nTJ IRA. \nGlass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe. \nReilly returns. \nPooch tests hinges with his tweezers. T.J. hands Glass a crimp. Pooch pries off a back panel, fingers shaking, lifts it every so slightly, sees complex circuitry inside, the red glow of a digital readout counting down. \nPOOCH Oh shit... \nT.J. Fuck factor ten. \nGLASS Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe. \nSynchronizing his chronometer to the counter, Glass begins disengaging sensor switches. \nGLASS (cont.)

Triple V.O.M... brilliant... this guy's a master... \nFinally he comes to the heart of the bomb, a pair of tiny wires leading to the blasting cap, one yellow, one red.

There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire. \nReilly gulps. The device teeters, slightly, alarming T.J. and Pooch. Glass nods. T.J. and Pooch each grab a corner of the device to steady it. Reilly follows their lead and kneels, goes to reach for a corner as well, one hand starts to tremble. \nGLASS (cont.) You can go back to the van if you like. \nREILLY No, I'm with you. \nReilly focuses and wills his hands to steady.    He grabs a corner and closes his eyes, mind over matter.    Sweat streams as he concentrates like never before. \nPooch and T.J. stare at the wires with intensity. \n15 seconds, 14, 13,... Glass pulls out a clipper. \n12, 11, 10... He eases the clipper into position. \n9, 8, 7... He draws in a breath. \nClosing his eyes, he clips the yellow wire.    Reilly's eyes snap open. \nThe counter stops on 4 - no explosion. \nPooch and T.J. whoop and hug like drunk madmen.   Glass steps away, stone-faced. Reilly follows him, wobbly. \nREILLY (cont.)

Nothing traceable. \nINT BAR \nPooch and T.J. have the device on the ground a few feet away from the Earring's body. They delicately continue to take it apart so it can be transported safely. Schnoz sits nearby, watching. Pooch is on the phone with his wife... \nPOOCH I don't know, honey. I'll see. No, everything's fine, it was nothing. \nAs he says this, he lifts a chunk of C4 and sets it aside. Pooch hangs up his phone. \nEXT STREET \nPooch and TJ exit the bar, moving to Glass and Reilly. \nPOOCH (cont.) You guys hungry? The wife's got a heap of lasagna leftover. \nT.J.

The Tracer yanks off his headphones in utter frustration. \nWINTERS (to his men) Okay, let's move! \nThe room erupts into action. Benson and the SWAT Team are the first ones out the door... \n71   EXT.   ALLEY - DAY                                              71 \nHauntingly familiar.

She glances around--then heads in the opposite direction of the Machine Shop. Pluchinsky curses. He starts to go after her, but realizes he'd better clear the area. He peals out. \n73   EXT.

A WINO eyes her carefully, lifts a bottle to his mouth and whispers... \nWINO She's out of the bag. \nMary exits the alley onto the street, searching where to go. She turns down the street and moves fast, eyes darting about. \n74   EXT.

He slides up the door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad.

He moves around the van, pulling Mary along. \nSwan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his face. \nSwan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces, having been hit in the shoulder. \nReilly moves forward about to take the shot. \nGLASS (cont.) Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch. He releases it, we're done for. \nSwan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat. \nSWAN Drop it. \nMARY (to Reilly) Take him! \nMary jerks away from Swan. \nReilly fast FIRES. \nSwan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the detonator... \nMary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him. \nReilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling, bleeding Mary. \nShe clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the remote. \nReilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she looks up into his eyes--distraught. \n", "test2_true": "Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up. \nGLASS (cont.)

Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the van. \nREILLY Talk to me.     Let's assess. \nGLASS Right. \nGlass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored in one of the C4 crates. It reads: \"1:30, 1:29...\" \nREILLY C'mon, talk to me! We can do it! \nGLASS He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.

Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... \nREILLY What's wrong? \nGLASS Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. \nREILLY Make up your mind, trigger. \nGLASS Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything? \nReilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around... \nREILLY Yeah, another round thing. \nGLASS Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. \nREILLY Which one's which? \nGLASS I don't know. \nREILLY What... ? \nGLASS When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. \nREILLY How the hell do you feel yellow? \nGLASS No excuses, just do it! \n10...

Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank the second cap out of its base. \nThe counter stops.    0:01. \nReilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath, hardly daring to believe it's true.

T.J. smiles... no longer threatened. \nGlass doesn't look up from his computer. \nGLASS You're late. \nGlass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen. \nReilly smiles and he sits next to Glass, hands him the transfer papers envelope. \nGLASS (cont.)

MADAM YU I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well... 
Jen sits silently reading. 
YU We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further. 
MADAM YU That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing. 
YU Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families. 
MADAM YU But don't be too lenient. 
YU No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking. 
MADAM YU A murderer? 
YU Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down. 
MADAM YU A female criminal!  Now that's news! 
Jen becomes visibly upset. 
JEN You say she killed a policeman? 
YU Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here, 
MADAM YU Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same. 
YU I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual... 
As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea. As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the pot slips from her hand.  Without even looking down, Jen instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move. 
YU ...And most likely smarter than a mere killer. 
Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by. 
JEN (formal) Greetings, Sir Te. 
SIR TE Hello, Madam Yu.  This is Li Mu Bai, the renowned swordsman. 
LI Delighted to meet you. 
Li sizes Jen up. 
TE Miss Yu is soon to be married.

MITCH (CONT'D) You look hot by the way, Jame. Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation. 
JAMIE Thanks... sort of...? 
MITCH No really. I never would've guessed twins. 
JAMIE Annnd that's probably enough-- 
MITCH Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually? Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks? 
JAMIE Our old kindergarten teacher?! 
MITCH Yeah. She always liked Dave better than me... 
JAMIE Honey, everyone likes Dave better than you. 
MITCH Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get her number, but she goes "I don't date former students," so I go, "great, do you fuck former students?" and then she calls me a "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs out without her coffee. So I got a free venti macchiato, which is cool- 
DAVE (O.S.) Bathed, changed and in their Pis. Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins: 
MITCH Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch... Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet. (loudly to babies) 
HI! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WHICH ONE 
ARE YOU?! (they just GURGLE) Why can't they talk yet? Are they retarded or something? 
JAMIE 
(LAUGHING) What?! No! They're fine! 
MITCH Really? The one on the left looks a little downsy. 
(JAMIE GASPS) Kidding! Kidding. (aside, to Dave) A little bit though, right? Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats. 
DAVE I'll be back right after the game, okay, Pumpkin? 
JAMIE Whenever. Have fun. 
MITCH See you, Jame! 
JAMIE Always a pleasure, Mitch. Mitch steals THREE PEARS and some TULIPS as he exits... 
CUT TO: 
TWO BEERS POPPING OPEN on the bottle cap-opener mounted on Mitch's dashboard... 
INT. MITCH'S CAR -- EVENING 
Mitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed along in his Fiero. Dave is reluctant. 
DAVE Yeah, I'm good. 
MITCH Really? You're going to make me drink alone? 
DAVE Yeah, well, you're driving, so... Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket. 
MITCH Oh, dude: great news. 
DAVE You found another futon? 
MITCH That's awesome, because I'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned for a major movie role yesterday. 
DAVE Nice. What movie? 
MITCH It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action. It's like a sexy Mentalist. 
DAVE Sounds cool. 
MITCH Yeah, I read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and I fucking killed it. I cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie. Plus I'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so...

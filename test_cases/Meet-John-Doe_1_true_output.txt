That's all right. 
Wider shot: MRS. MITCHELL lays his hat down somewhere. John takes a few steps inside the room, not quite knowing what to do. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
(turning to him) 
It's good to see you. Sit down. 
JOHN 
(mumbles) 
Thanks. 
He sits on the edge of a sofa, still clinging to the little box. Then holds box out awkwardly. 
JOHN 
(awkwardly) 
It's for Ann . . . 
MRS. MITCHELL 
(taking the box) 
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much. 
JOHN 
Flowers. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here. 
JOHN 
She isn't? 
MRS. MITCHELL 
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house. 
JOHN 
Oh! 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Did you want to see her about something important? 
JOHN 
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait. 
(suddenly) 
Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the 
Close-up: Of MRS. MITCHELL. She watches him, amused. 
JOHN 
Say, my coat's pretty wet. I'm afraid I might have wet the couch a little. 
Wider shot: JOHN is still struggling to find conversation. 
JOHN 
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers. 
He rises and looks around for hat on the floor and back of the chair. 
JOHN 
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
(finds his hat and gives it to him) 
Good night, John. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He starts away and suddenly stops, speculatively. He glances out of the corner of his eye toward MRS. MITCHELL. 
JOHN 
(going back to her) 
Say, Mrs. Mitchell, I, er, I'm kinda glad Ann isn't here. You see, I was, I came over here hoping to see her alone and kinda hoping I wouldn't, too. You know what I mean? There was something I wanted to talk to her about. But, well, IIt'll wait, I guess. Good night. 
Close-up: Of MRS. MITCHELL. She begins to sense what is on his mind, and her face becomes serious. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He smiles helplessly. Starts toward door. 
MRS. MITCHELL'S VOICE 
Good night, John. 
Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL. He stares at her a second. 
JOHN 
(suddenly) 
Say, look, Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever been married? 
(catches himself) 
Oh, sure you have. 
(grins sheepishly) 
Gosh! That's pretty silly! I guess you must think I'm kinda batty! 
JOHN shakes his head at his own stupidity. 
JOHN 
(can't get over it) 
Well, I guess I'd better be going at that! 
He bows again, and starts for the door. When he gets there, he is stopped by MRS. MITCHELL's voice. 
MRS. MITCHELL'S VOICE 
John. My husband said: "I love you. Will you marry me?" 
JOHN 
(whirls) 
He did? What happened? 
MRS. MITCHELL 
I married him. 
JOHN comes right back to her. 
Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL. 
JOHN 
(full of excitement) 
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh? 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Uh-huh. 
JOHN 
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. 
JOHN 
And you know, I think she's in love with another man, the one she made up. You know, the real John Doe. Well, that's pretty tough competition. 
Two shot: JOHN and MRS. MITCHELL. She is terribly fond of JOHN and deeply sympathetic. 
JOHN 
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!

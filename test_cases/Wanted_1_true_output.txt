SLOAN (V.0.) We stay in the shadows. .. to the kitchen, where a massive man with a three- headed dog tattoo on his hand, flips burgers. THE CHEF. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANSION - DAY 
The CAMERA moves across an expansive lawn... 
SLOAN (V.0.) We disappear into our surroundings. .until it finds a man with a three-headed dog tattoo on his hand, trimming a hedge. THE GARDENER. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUN COUNTER - DAY 
The CAMERA moves down a gun display case... 
SLOAN Because the easiest place to hide is in plain sight... .until it finds a GUN SALESMAN holding out a weapon to an Italian customer. He also has the tattoo. He's THE 
GUNSMITH. 
BACK TO: 
EXT. CITY BLOCK - DAY 
Sloan is still walking with Wesley. Wesley watches every face that passes them by... any of them could be Fraternity members. 
SLOAN ..until that time when we are called into action. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
The Chef loads plates of food up on the warmer, where a WAITRESS picks them up and delivers them to a group of prominent looking BUSINESSMEN. The lead businessman digs into his steak, and immediately his left arm starts to curl up, like he's having a heart attack. His cohorts look on as he spills over, knocking all the plates off the table, gasping for breath, his throat closed. When the CAMERA PANS OVER AGAIN, the Chef is gone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANSION - DAY 
The Gardener works his gardening shears on a hedge in the front of this mansion... CLIP, CLIP, CLIP. We realize 
A, he's cutting a hole all the way through the hedge. Then, he reaches down into his burlap sack and withdraws a long range rifle with a scope. He pokes the rifle through the freshly-cut hole, looks through the lens, starts to squeeze his trigger... The CAMERA SHOOTS WAY UP to give us an aerial view of the neighborhood. We see that we are in the hills over the city, and across the canyon, a Japanese man is just pulling into his driveway, driving a black Audi, a mile away. He brakes his car, opens his door, but THWAPI A bullet disintegrates his head and he topples over, never knowing what hit him. Back at the hole in the hedge, we see the Gardener's eyeball looking through from the other side... until it disappears and he is gone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STORE PARKING LOT - DAY 
The customer takes the gun from the Gunsmith and pays him in cash. 
He then tucks the gun in his belt and walks out the door, like he's a bad-ass, instead of the goombah that he is. He only gets a block before the gun at his waist EXPLODES, causing him to flop on the sidewalk, like he just stepped on a land mine. The bell to the Gun Shop jingles as the Gunsmith leaves and heads in the opposite direction, whistling to himself, not paying attention to the pedestrians running to help the dying Italian. 
SLOAN (V.0.) And when the time comes that we are called, death is as certain as the sun.

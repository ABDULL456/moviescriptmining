The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian. 
FADE IN: 
OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS: 
INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN 
PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows. 
INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING 
Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel. 
INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING 
Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM. 
EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off. 
EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR 
Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall:

The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we... 
INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING 
Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session: 
MIRANDA 
This is your stepfather who came to visit you? 
CHLOE 
My stepfather?  No.   He's dead. (beat) I killed him. Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist. 
MIRANDA 
That's the first time you admit it. 
CHLOE 
So? There's a first time for everything. 
MIRANDA 
(jotting this down) It means you're finally past the denial stage. This is good, Chloe. 
CHLOE 
I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it. 
MIRANDA 
You only killed your stepfather as far as I know. 
CHLOE 
I should've taken care of my mother. She knew all along.    You remind me of her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIRANDA 
I remind you of your mother? 
CHLOE 
Always so put together. Like you iron your underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the -- 
MIRANDA 
(getting her back on track) Let's get back to your visitor last night. 
CHLOE 
The Devil. 
MIRANDA 
Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?

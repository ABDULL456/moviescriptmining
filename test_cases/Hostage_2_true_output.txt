METZGER Yes, sir.  They'll only accept calls from your cell. 
TALLEY Way to go. 
They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill -- 
ANDERS Chief, this is Brad Dill.  Dennis and Kevin work for him. 
DILL I didn't know anything about this.  I didn't know what they were gonna do. 
TALLEY Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what they were going to do until they did it. I want you to take a look at something. 
Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior Kim's security tape -- 
TALLEY (CONT'D) Can you identify this man? 
DILL That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too. 
TALLEY (to Metzger) Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier. 
Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill -- 
TALLEY (CONT'D) Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that? 
DILL Keeps to himself, more like. 
TALLEY You have his address? 
DILL Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go -- 
Dill pulls out a tattered address book.  Talley hands the book to Anders, who copies the address -- 
TALLEY (to Anders) Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house. 
ANDERS Yes, sir. 
Anders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs. Pena's door -- 
METZGER Chief!  The Sheriffs are ten minutes out! 
Talley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief is tempered by something he did not expect:  Loss. 
Talley keys his shoulder mike -- 
TALLEY (into his radio) Louise? 
LOUISE'S VOICE Go, Chief. 
TALLEY Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place. 
LOUISE'S VOICE I know the one. 
TALLEY Tell her I'm almost home. 
INT. SMITH'S SECURITY CLOSET -- NIGHT 
Dennis is on the floor with the money, touching it, feeling it, smelling it.  Mars is standing over him, profoundly unmoved -- 
DENNIS There's gotta be a million bucks here. Maybe two million! 
Mars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and the door -- 
MARS It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide. 
DENNIS Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich. 
MARS We're trapped in a house. 
Mars walks away -- 
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT 
Dennis and Mars are returning to the front of the house, Dennis irritated at Mars's lack of enthusiasm -- 
DENNIS We can take it with us. 
MARS You can't run with suitcases. 
Dennis grabs Mars by the arm, stopping him -- 
DENNIS Then we'll stuff it up our asses.  This is the payoff.  This is every dream you ever had, all in those two bags. 
Mars continues on without responding, Dennis angrily following -- 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 
Kevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as Mars and Dennis enter.  A female anchor is reporting on the events at York Estates with Dennis's booking photo cut into the picture -- 
ANCHOR (from the tube) -- thought to be Dennis James Rooney. Rooney was recently released from the Antelope Valley Correctional Institute where he served time for robbery. 
Dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big smile -- 
DENNIS (thrilled) Check me out!  I look like fuckin' Jon Bon Jovi.

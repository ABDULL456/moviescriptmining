BIRDMAN (V.O.) It's always 'we' brother. 
The television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers. 
We slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake, watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV... 
35   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          35 
...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow. 
RIGGAN Fuck you! Fuck you! 
He picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He immediately calms himself and walks over. (CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN (CONT'D) What's up? 
JAKE Um... Well. Two hours to curtain. Why don't you rest a little bit? 
RIGGAN Yeah. Sure. 
JAKE Last preview, buddy. We're almost there. 
RIGGAN Okay. 
JAKE How ya doin? 
RIGGAN Good. Great. JAKE Good. That's good. (A beat.) The, uh, money came through. I just have to transfer it to the account. 
RIGGAN Oh, that's terrific... 
JAKE Okay. Well, I'm gonna do that. (He stares at Riggan who seems about to collapse.) You know I'm proud of you, right? This took balls. And you did it. 
Riggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes. 
RIGGAN I can't do this anymore, Jake. 
JAKE What? 
RIGGAN I think I'm gonna cancel the preview. I'm exhausted. 
JAKE It's a joke, right? (He forces a laugh.) Good one, Riggan. 
(CONTINUED) 
RIGGAN I'm starting to believe that this is not for me. The applause is... lukewarm. I think they're laughing at me. 
JAKE What are you--? Listen. There's a three block line of people waiting to see you. We are sold out. It's a full house. 
RIGGAN Really? 
JAKE Yes. And the French embassador is coming. And the prince of Saudi Arabia, with one of his wives. And... I wasn't going to tell you this, but-- Martin Scorsese. He's casting for his new film. But don't tell anyone, okay? This is between you and me. RIGGAN Okay. I'll be ready. 
Riggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts. A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his conversation with Riggan. 
LESLEY How is he? 
JAKE He'll be okay. 
LESLEY Poor creature. 
LAURA Is it true? Scorsese? JAKE Yes. And the new Pope too. (Beat.) 
They both understand. 
LAURA You're an asshole, Jake. 
JAKE I'm the one keeping this boat afloat. 
(CONTINUED) 
LESLEY So there is no line of people out there? 
JAKE I don't know. Now go and get ready. That's your job. (He begins to walk.) I'll better invest in a taco truck, or a strip joint near the airport. 
Laura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room. She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist.

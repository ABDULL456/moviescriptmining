JONAH 
(TO JASON) Tell him not to jerk off with a noose around his neck. It's dangerous. 
JASON 
(TO BEN) You shouldn't jerk off with a noose around your neck because it's dangerous. 
BEN Okay, very good. 
JONAH 
(TO JASON) Oh, and tell him if he has to, tell him he needs a teammate or a spotter there. 
JASON 
(TO BEN) Right. And if you do, um, you should have a teammate or a spotter there. 
BEN Great.

INTERCUT: 
DR. ANGELO I actually don't know where he is tonight. But I've made myself available to his patients and I'd be happy to help you. 
ALISON Can you help me find him? Can you give me his number? 
DR. ANGELO Oh, no. You know what? Actually, I'm under strict instructions not give out his number, but I can help you through this. 
ALISON No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my own doctor. You really won't give me his number? Because this is my first baby and he promised that he would be here for me and I need you to give me his number, okay? 
DR. ANGELO Dr. Howard is not available tonight. Bet everything's going to be okay, I assure you. 
ALISON No, I don't want you to help me because I have no idea who you are! I want my own goddamned doctor! You make sure he calls me! Alison clicks off the phone.

INT. ALISON'S GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ben runs into Alison's guest house. It is empty. 
BEN Hello? 
EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BACKYARD 
Ben uses the back door to get into the house. 
INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM 
Ben checks every room in the house. 
BEN Please be in here. Hello? Hello! 
INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM 
Ben finds Alison in a bubble bath surrounded by candles and 
SOOTHING MUSIC. 
BEN Hello? Alison. Hello? 
ALISON Ben? 
BEN Alison. What is this, like a water birth? What are we doing? Should we go? 
ALISON Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about. Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life. So just...just be calm. 
BEN 
(WHISPERING) Okay. Okay. Let's relax. Do you want to talk about things? I feel really bad about a lot of the shit I did. I can't believe I said some of that. That's all I think about in my head. 
IT-- 
ALISON I don't want to talk about it. 
BEN But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so, we can talk-- 
KNOCKED UP - 121. 
ALISON No. I don't want to go there. Don't go there, okay?

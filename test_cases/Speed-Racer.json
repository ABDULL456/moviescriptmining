{"test1_input": "WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! A thug soundly slaps the face ofa handsome Japanese man. When the beating is over, the Japanese man slumps forward, his arms behind his back. \nCRUNCHER Ithought we had a deal... When he hears the voice, he lifts his head and we see a huge man with a body like a cement-lined safe, sitting behind a desk, lighting a cigar. This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) I thought we were friends. He blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the chandelier which is jiggling steadily. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Maybe where you come from, this is how you treat your friends, but 'round here we don't take to kindly to this kind of thing, do we fellas? Thug #1 steps in and wails away on him again. \nTHUG #1 You hurt our feelings! \nCRUNCHER Problem is, I like you Katsu. Cruncher grins, his teeth like stacked dice. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) And I got a real soft spot in my heart for that sister of yours. He begins opening a large package wrapped with butcher paper. -Inside is a bloody rack of ribs. \nCONTINUED: \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Normally in a situation such as this we would be pouring you a nice comfy pair of cement shoes, but... He stands and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is behind the desk. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) I think I got another solution.. He dips the bloody meat into the tank filled with piranha. The water foams as the carnivorous fish shred flesh from bone. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) How're my babies doing? Huh? Hungry? Ready for seconds? Boys! They grab Katsu and haul him to the fishtank. \nKATSU No! \nTHUG #2 Hope dem fishes like Japanese. \nKATSU No, please! \nTHUG #1 Gonna be hard to drive with skellie hands. Cruncher takes hold of Katsu's jaw. \nCRUNCHER You even think about turning rat and next time it's your sister going in there. \nA They begin forcing his hand into the tank when suddenly red light begins flashing. Everyone freezes. Cruncher grabs the phone on his desk. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) What?! \nINT.'TRUCK CAB \nWe realize that Cruncher's office is in the trailer of a semi-truck which is cruising down an empty rural highway. \nTRUCK DRIVER Someone's tailing us. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher signals to the man at the far end of the room who is guarding the door. The guard slides open a peek-a- boo slot and sees a pair of headlights. \nCRUNCHER is it him? \nDOOR GUARD It could be. Cruncher goes to the phone. \nCRUNCHER Can you see him yet? \nTRUCK DRIVER Here he comes-- The car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels his gut clench as he recognizes the infamous car of Racer \nX. \nTRUCK DRIVER (CONT'D) Oh God... \nCRUNCHER Get him! Everyone leaps into action, shoving Katsu back into a chair. Filling their fists with guns, sliding open murder holes slots at a variety of heights. Cruncher barks into the phone. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Crush him! \nINT. TRUCK CAB \nThe driver screws his jaw tight and throws the wheel to smash into the smaller car-- \nCONTINUED: But the little black tinted bug flits away with effortless ease, dancing out in front of the truck. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher flips over the top of his desk revealing the controls for a mini-machine gun located on the bottom of the truck. He grabs the controls which are linked to an infrared sighting camera. \nCRUNCHER Where is he? \nINT. TRUCK CAB \nThe driver watches the red tail-lights glowing like demon eyes. \nTRUCK DRIVER He's out front. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher, hits another button and he front grill of the truck opens, dropping the lower half like the double- hinged jaw of a snake. An Apache helicopter-style rocket launcher thrusts out of the darkness. Cruncher sights the car. \nCRUNCHER Gotcha. He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car-- But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by, exploding further down the highway. Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris open and the barrels of several weapons extend out. \nTRUCK DRIVER Here he comes! Cruncher fires again, the red rocket just missing, rending open the tree line with a fireball. \nCONTINUED: The little car drops back alongside the truck and fires, bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls of the truck. The truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly at the black car. Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he opens fire-- The black car slows, drawing the chasing gun fire until Cruncher shoots his own tires. \nCRUNCHER Aww, I thought you fixed that! The black car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside, puncturing a hole in the fish tank. \nTHUG #1 Boss! \n", "test1_true": "CRUNCHER (CONT'D) Vinny put your finger in there! Vinny doesn't want to. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Do it! \nINT.

CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher thinks fast over Vinny's screams. He looks at Katsu and immediately knows what he has to do. \nCONTINUED: \nCRUNCHER Pull over but don't stop. \nEXT. LONELY HIGHWAY \nThe truck slows, easing onto the shoulder as the black car follows. The back of the truck slides up and the gangsters toss Katsu out, leaving him behind with a spray of gravel. Katsu looks up into the glaring lights of the black car. A car door opens. Boots crunch gravel as someone walks toward us silhouetted by car lights. It is the masked racer himself--- Racer x. \nINT. RACER X'S CAR \nKatsu is in the passenger seat as the car hums quietly down the empty highway. \nKATSU Thank you. You saved my life. \nRACER X I didn't save anything worth saving unless you get smart. Real fast. Racer talks without looking at him. \nRACER X (CONT'D) You thought you could take on the Cartel. You can't. Not without help. \nKATSU I don't know what'you're talking about. \nRACER X You won the Cortex Invitational and you weren't supposed to. You did it to save Okamoto Engineering. \nKATSU It has belonged to my family for five generations. \nCONTINUED: \nRACER X And now someone else wants it. The only way you can stop it from happening is to talk to the authorities. \nKATSU There is nothing to talk about. \nRACER X You have been on cruncher Block's leash for.so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man. The only way you'll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice. \nKATSU Justice/ That's a commodity I don't waste money on. Racer X immediately pulls his car over. \nRACER X Get out. Wearing his smirk like a cheap suit, Katsu gets out. \nKATSU I'll see you at Fuji. \nRACER X You won't finish. When you lose, if you can still dial a phone, call this number. He hands him a card. The card reads; CHIEF INSPECTOR \nDETECTOR. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM \nKID Sprittle is working hard on a test when he hears the behind him whisper. \nDANNY Hey monkey-lover, show me your test or I'll kick your ass after school. \nSPRITTLE Sorry. Cheaters never prosper. The kid to the left chimes in. \nCONTINUED: \nMALCOM Spriiiitle, when Chim-chim's bad, do you spank the monkey? \nSPRITTLE No, your mother does it for me. Malcom almost swallows his tongue as several other kids snicker.. \nTEACHER All right! Malcom! Danny! Sprittle! To the Principal's office. March! There is a chorus of, \"I didn't do it, awwww, not fair.\" \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Now! \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. \nThe same school that Speed attended but now where Rex used to wait, Speed is leaning against the Mach-5. Chim- chim is sitting next to him. The bell rings and the students begin piling out. When the last few tumble down the stairs, Chim-chim emits a small, sad whine. \nSPEED Looks like someone's in trouble again. \nINT. MACH 5 \nIt's later and they're driving home. Sprittle stares out the window, mumbling, identifying make, model, and engines of passing cars. \nSPEED Want to talk about it? Sprittle shakes his head. \nSPRITTLE K-W Integral 4-door with twin-cam turbine...C-foster-K 1200, modified split-rail and supershocks... \nCONTINUED: \nSPEED Was it that Stanton kid again?

The main headline: ANOTHER DIRTY RACER? \nCONTINUED: \nSPARKY \". .controversy surrounds Racer Motors now embroiled in IP litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not Speed used an illegal device, the Fuji Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer family legacy, a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this beloved sport.\" \nMOM Sparky. That's enough. \nSPARKY Sorry ma'am. \nSPRITTLE I'm going to send that guy some Chim-chim cookies. Chim-chim guffaws. \nPOPS You'll do no such thing. \nSPRITTLE We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps into the doorway. \nSPEED This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him. \nSPARKY You mean Remmington? \nSPEED He said it'd get worse and worse and by the end of the year you'd be filing for bankruptcy, Pops. \nSPRITTLE Okay, he's definitely gettin' some monkey cookies. \nMOM Sprittle! \nCONTINUED: (2 \nPOPS He was just trying to scare you, son. They tried the same thing with Rex. If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get. \nSPEED How? What can we do? How can we fight this? He tosses the newspaper. \nPOPS The truth will come out. \nSPEED The truth? Don't be naive, Pops. He leaves. \nINT. SPEED'S ROOM \nThe Ben Burns poster is ripped from the wall. Speed wads its up and throws it into the garbage. He sinks down to his bed, a sense of powerlessness crushing the life out of him. Mom taps and then cracks the door. \nMOM Speed? Are you okay? \nSPEED .I don't know. She comes in and sits beside him, putting her arm around him. \nMOM It'll be okay. We'll get through it. \nSPEED I don't know, mom. I might have really messed things up. \nMOM How? \nSPEED By not joining Remmington. \nCONTINUED: \nMOM Don't be silly. You'd have never been happy driving for that terrible man. \nSPEED But maybe racing isn't about being happy. Maybe Remmington's right and it's all about business and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump. \nMOM Now you listen to me, young man. What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car. \nSPEED .I loved that old wagon. \nMOM And do you remember the time Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive-- Speed smiles. \nSPEED And I turned it over. \nMOM My heart still pounds just thinking about it. \nSPEED Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks. \nMOM I thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - PAST \nTen year old Speed comes in the door, leading Rex, wearing a small bandage on his forehead, smiling, a big black gap where his two front teeth should be. \nMOM I don't think I ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash. \nINT. SPEED'S ROOM - PRESENT \nMOM Speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do, I feel like I'm watching someone paint or play music. When I go to the races, I go to watch you make art and it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you just take my breath away and it's at those moments, when I feel your father's chest swell and I know he's smiling, trying to pretend he doesn't have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces. \n", "test2_true": "MOM Because I am so impossibly proud to be your mother. And even though your father doesn't say it, he is too. She puts her arms around him. \nMOM (CONT'D) Don't worry. We'll figure this out. We just have to stick together. Something good will happen. You'll see. Ding dong. The front doorbell chimes. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - DAY \nSprittle opens the door revealing Inspector Detector of the Corporate Investigation Bureau who looks older and harder than when we saw him in the flashbacks Behind him is Racer X. Sprittle sees the masked racer and screams. Chim-Chim screams. They look at each other screaming and then slam the door. They begin running around, flailing like Chicken Little, waving their arms in panic. \nSPRITTLE \nRACER HEX! THE HARBINGER OF BOOM! \nRUN FOR YOUR LIVES! Popsstorms into the room. \nPOPS What are you two squawking about? They dive behind the couch but peek out as Pops heads for the door. \nSPRITTLE Pops, whatever you do, don't open the door! \nEXT. RACER HOUSE \nRacer X doesn't like it. \nRACER X This is a bad idea. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR If it was any other driver, you'd be here. Popsopens the door and Racer X sets his jaw. \nPOPS Inspector Detector? \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR Good morning, Mr.. Racer. I know it's been a long time-- \nCONTINUED: He extends his hand and Pop shakes it. \nPOPS Ten years. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR Yes. I'm sorry for this intrusion, but I was hoping to have a word with you and Speed. Pops eyes the masked racer. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR (CONT'D) It's important. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMom serves coffee and cookies. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR We've been after Remmington for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing but we haven't had the evidence we need to convict him. Until now. Sprittle and Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as Mom offers the masked racer a cup of coffee. \nMOM Here you are, Mr. X. Sprittle points at Racer X. \nSPRITTLE What's he doing here? \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR Racer X works closely with our WRL corporate crimes division, helping us recruit drivers like you, Speed. Most of the media, which you are now seeing is controlled by the Major Sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to the sport. The truth is he's our most valuable weapon against these villains. \nSPEEED Why does he always wear that mask? \nCONTINUED: \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR If any of, you actually knew his identity, you would become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious Fixers in the world. Gulp. They both sink back down behind the couch. \nSPEED What do you want with me? \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR You're familiar with the driver Katsu Okamoto? \nSPEED Of course. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR For years he has been contracted by a Fixer named Cruncher Block who we know works for Remmington. Recently, Katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop in the stock price of Okamoto Engineering. We believe this is a part of a corporate strategy to allow Mushi motors to buy control of Okamoto. Katsu doesn't want this to happen and he began resisting, thinking.that he could do it on his own. After Fuji, he realized he needed help. \nPOPS ,Why help him? \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR Because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Remmington which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives. The problem is, he won't give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his family's company. \nSPEED How? \nCONTINUED: (2) \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR There is an up-coming race that Katsu believes if he can win, it will catapult Okamoto Engineering back into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out which should kill it. \nSPEED But there aren't any more races left except for the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify. Inspector takes a big breath. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR There aren't any track races. This is a cross-country rally. \nSPARKY You mean The Crucible? \nPOPS What?! \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR I know it seems cruel of me to ask, but Katsu made it clear that he had to have Speed an X on his team or there would be no deal. \nPOPS Absolutely out of the question. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B-- \nPOPS No! Rally racing is a back alley sport full of jackals, head- hunters and thugs! I'm sorry, Inspector but I lost one son to that death-trap. I won't lose another. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR I understand. If you change your \n", "test2_id": 106, "test3_input": "SPEED What's it look like? \nSPRITTLE Where ya goin? \nSPEED I don't know. I just gotta get away from here. \nSPRITTLE Why? \nSPEED Because. \nSPRITTLE Because why? \nSPEED Because I have to. \nSPRITTLE Can we come with you? Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu. \nSPEED What? \nSPRITTLE Can we come with you? \nSPEED No. \nSPRITTLE Why? \nSPEED You'll understand when it's your turn. He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door. \nINT. RACER FAMILY LIVING ROOM \nthere, Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already sitting, waiting, a heaviness in his.limbs. \nCONTINUED: \nPOPS Speed, before you go, I'd like to say a few things. Will you sit with your old man for a minute? Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag. \nSPEED Don't try to stop me. \nPOPS I won't. I made a mistake trying to tell you what to do at Cortega. You were right. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again. Speed sits. \nPOPS (CONT'D) I want you to know that I acted rashly. I said things I wish I hadn't. Your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of my self but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I did a pretty good job of it. I wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was. \nSPEED Thanks. \nPOPS The truth was, I couldn't have been more proud of you son. Not because you won, but because you stood up, you weren't afraid and you did what you thought was right. \nSPEED So? It didn't amount to anything. It was completely meaningless. \nPOPS How could it be meaningless? I saw my son become a man. I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off of every driver on the road. This is not meaningless. This is the reason for a father's life. Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPOPS (CONT'D) I admit I went to Cortega because I was afraid that what happened to Rex was going to happen to you. And I just couldn't take that. I couldn't loose another one of my boys like that again. But what I realize in Cortega was that I didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I lost him here. I lost him when he walked out of this house and I let him go without telling him how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did. You'll never know how much I regret that mistake, but it's enough that I'll never make it again. He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him. \nPOPS (CONT'D) I love you Speed. I understand that every child leaves home but I want you to know that door is always open and you can always come back. \nSPEED I love you Pops. I'm just so confused right now. I don't what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm locked up in some kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense. \nPOPS I know what that's like. When Rex died I didn't even. know if I wanted salt on my eggs, let alone if I wanted to keep building cars. Then, do you remember when we sat here, that night, watching old Ben Burns and Dugazi? You remember that? Speednods vaguely. \nPOPS (CONT'D) Sittin' here, cheering with you, something just clicked, like a light being switched on inside of me and after that, I never had trouble remembering how I liked me eggs. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nSPEED Jeez Pops. That's just it. That's part of my problem. \nPOPS What? \nSPEED That race. The '43 Prix. Burns and Dugazi? It was fixed. Remmington told me the whole story. It was all about some DNF names Rotts. They've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed. That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow. \nPOPS I don't believe that. Remmington's a crook. You can't believe a crook. \nSPEED I don't think he was lying, Pops. \nPOPS The Grand Prix? A sham? Ding dong. \nPOPS (CONT'D) Who could that be? \nWITH Speed opens the door. She seems to glow, radiating her own incandescence. \nSPEED Horuko?! \nHORUKO Forgive me for intruding but I had to come before it was too late. Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another set-up. \nHORUKO (CONT'D) This is not a trick. I swear to you. I am not my brother. \nPOPS You going to ask the lovely lady in? \nCONTINUED: (4) \nSPEED Yeah, sure. Come on in. She steps in, looking somewhat out of place in the suburban living room. \nPOPS Can I get you something to drink? \nHORUKO No. My security man believes I am still at the opera, so I only have a moment. She turns to Speed. \n", "test3_true": "SPEED It's fine. Just another lesson learned. \nHORUKO No.. It is they who are in need of a lesson. She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to Speed. \nHORUKO (CONT'D) This rightfully belongs to you. He opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up. \nSPEED An invitation to compete in the 91st annual Grand Prix? \nHORUKO My brother was planning to decline anyway but I studied the rules very carefully and as a member of the Okamoto team, if you present this invitation on the day of the race, they must allow you to compete. Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the back. \nCONTINUED: (5). \nPOPS Whaddya think of that, Mr. Its- Always-Fixed? \nSPEED \nHORUKO You do not have to say anything. I only hope you drive as you did in Casa Cristo and you wipe the smiles from their faces. \nPOPS We don't have a car. Sparky! \nSPARKY Right here Pops. Sparky steps out of the kitchen doorway. \nPOPS What're you doing in the kitchen? \nSPARKY Same as everyone else. Behind him the entire family peeks out. \nSPEED I don't believe it. You were listening the whole time? Trixie goes to him. \nTRIXIE We were worried about you. \nHORUKO I would say good luck Saturday but you do not need it. You are already very lucky to have such a family. \nSPEED Goodbye and thank you. He closes the door. \nPOPS Come on! We got work to do. \nCONTINUED: (6) \nSPARKY But Pops, the race is less than 36 hours away. \nPOPS Isn't that how fast Remmington said he could build that tin can with all his fancy machines? \nSPARKY Yeah. \nPOPS Then we'll do it in 32. Let's go! He heads for the garage, Sprittle leaping after him. \nSPRITTLE I want to help. \nPOPS Well come on. \nSPRITTLE Chim-chim too? \nPOPS We need everyone. \nINT.

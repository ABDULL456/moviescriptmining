{"train": "SPEED RACER \nWritten by \nLarry & Andy Wachowski \n1st Draft \nJanuary 4th, 2007 \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST \nA battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars and checkered flags and the words \"Start Your Engines!\" Beats up and down, a sewing machine needle of anxious, restless, adolescent energy. A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form, then hesitates, twitching with the speed of a humming bird wing caught between two fingers, then is quickly erased as a different answer is chosen. The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty. A ten year old boy stares at the next question. \nTEST QUESTION \nGrace buys a bag of 240 jellybeans. There are 35 yellow ones, 52 red ones, 63 green ones, 26 white ones, 41 blue ones and 40 black ones. If Grace wants to eat one of each while keeping her eyes closed, what is the minimum number she will have to eat? \nHis mouth tries to makes sense of the question but it's not working. \nHe looks around at the other students quietly, diligently filling in their ovals while he fidgets, his leg beating, his pencil fluttering, a pot jiggling its lid, about to boil over. \nHe reads the question again. Greek. Chinese. Meaningless. He looks up at the clock. The second hand sweeps towards the 12. Then back at the test. \nSomething suddenly clicks. \nHe stares at the clock, pencil poised, waiting until the second hand hits the 12 and he's off- Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could possibly be reading the questions. \nINT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - DAY - PAST \nMrs. Racer sits across the desk from Speed's teacher. \nMOM \nDISTRACTED \nCONTINUED: \nTEACHER No, that's not exactly right. Your son seems to be interested in only one thing. Mom knows what's coming. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) All he talks about, all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing. \nMOM Well you know, his father designs racing cars. \nTEACHER And where is your husband? \nMOM He's-working. He couldn't make it. \nTEACHER Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree. Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher glances back to her records. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Is your husband's name Rex? \nMOM No, Rex is his older brother. Why? \nTEACHER This is the test he turned in last week. She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on. The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out: \n\"GO REX GO!\" \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST \nSpeed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing pictures in the corner of the test booklet. He is drawing little race cars,. He flips a few of the pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two cars collide. \nCONTINUED: He continues to draw as the background of the classroom fades to white behind him, becoming the black corner that he is drawing on. We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars battle each other heading for a photo-finish. Speed makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound as two cars try to block the Mach 5, smashing into one another as -- The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash, crossing the finish line still in the air. Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry, making the sound of the roaring crowd. The teacher hears him and looks up, frowning as she sees him lost in his fantasy world. A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning to watch him, a smile creeping across her face; there is no one in the entire school like him. The teacher is about to say something when the bell rings. Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up, in motion before anyone else. \nTEACHER Alright, pencils down, bring your \nTESTS-- Thwack! Speed slaps his down and is already heading for the door. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) --to my desk. Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out. \nTEACHER (CONT'D) Speed Racer, slow down! \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL \nSpeed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees- Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big brother, Rex Racer. \nCONTINUED: He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool cars pass by. Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car collector show; vintage and concept cars are as ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world. Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark fin circling until-- The car door pops open and snaps shut. The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window. Speed smiles. \nREX .I take it you're ready to go? Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him. \nREX (CONT'D) So, who was school? \nYOUNG SPEED Fine. Are you going to the track? Mom said you were. You don't have to drop me off, I could just go with you. \nREX No way. He starts the car and roadster growls to life. \nYOUNG SPEED Oh, come on, take me with you. Come on, please. \nREX I can't, Speed. Pops would kill me. \nYOUNG SPEED He doesn't have to know. I won't say anything. Nobody will know. Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease pleasepleasepleeeease. Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEXT. TECH PIT \nSparky smiles. \nSPARKY Great move, Speed. Careful on the butterfly coming up. You may wanna ease up-- \nSPEED Not this time, Sparky. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT \nSpeed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar. They can feel that something special might be happening. \nEXT. TECH PIT \nSparky checks his stop watch. \nSPARKY Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you're racing? \nCONTINUED: He can see him. \nSPEED Yeah... Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the past. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST \nRex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission, dominating the race exactly like Speed. \nEXT. GRANDSTANDS \nPops stands watching the race through binoculars Young Spped is beside him. \nYOUNG SPEED Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops? Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He goes back to his binoculars. \nYOUNG SPEED (CONT'D) He's gonna win it. He's gonna set the course record. Nobody's gonna catch him. \nPOPS Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race to run. \nYOUNG SPPED No way. It's over. My brother's the best racer in the world. Everybody else is running for second. The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel. \nEXT. CREW PIT \nBlackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief, knotting his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts. \nBLACKJACK BENELLI I told you to take him out! \nCONTINUED: \nCREW CHIEF #1 We're trying, sir. He's just too fast. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY \nRex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller- coaster, opening an even bigger lead. As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is someone right behind him, a ghost car-- Speed. As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the present. \nINT. MEDIA ROW - PRESENT \nThe buzz is palpable. \nLOCAL ANNOUNCER --it's unbelievable folks, no one's seen moves like this, since that remarkable night eight years \nAGO-- \nHAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER --there's no doubt in my mind, he's gunning for it-- \nAUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER --driving like a man possessed, a man haunted by his past--- \nCHINESE ANNOUNCER --a record that has stood for eight years set by.his,older-- \nFRENCH ANNOUNCER --he is not alone out there, he is chasing someone, he is chasing the ghost of Rex Racer-- \nEXT. GRANDSTANDS \nin the glass of Pop's binos we can see the dim reflection of the two brothers racing. \nCONTINUED: Pops stands beside Mom. He is still watching the race with his trusty binos though he is now a little older, plumper and balder.. He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same time that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair next to him. \nSPRITTLE Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it, couldn't he? Pops goes back to his binos. \nSPRITTLE (CONT'D) What if he does? What if he does it, Pops? \nPOPS Sssh! \nSPRITTLE I don't know if I can watch this... He holds the binos as though afraid to look when-- A hairy hand comes in and takes them away. Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts the binos to his eyes. Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing another cheer. Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her. Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her gut. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET- DAY - PAST \nThe little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with a pack of girls, their little mouths as sharp as razors. In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine. \nBLONDE PACK LEADER My Daddy told me he used to work for the Mishida Motorwerks but he quit. \n(MORE) \nCONTINUED: \nBLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D) My daddy said that was a completely crazy thing to do. He says the whole family is crazy. \nSPEED I won't. He hugs his little brother, knowing it might be for the last time. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM \nRex heads for the door but Pops is waiting for him. \nPOPS So, you're quitting? \nREX I have to. \nPOPS No you don't. This is a choice. You're selling out, walking away from everything we've built here. \nREX I'm done arguing with you Pops. He turns back towards the door. \nPOPS Don't you walk away from me! \nREX You can't tell me what to do. It's my life to live. He takes hold of the doorknob. \nPOPS If you walk out that door, you better not ever come back! The door slams in response. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT PRESENT \nSpeed and the ghost of his brother cross, switching positions as the memories come faster and faster. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PAST \nSpeed sits on the floor, glued to the television, \nON watching a big race that Rex is in. Mom and Pops are the couch behind him. All of them sit in.a suspended state, a fist of tension squeezing the breath out of them. One the screen, is a cloud of smoke billowing from a tangle of metal. \nCONTINUED: \nRALLY ANNOUNCER (V.0.) Rex Racer riving the black and red Uniron car, got in a tangle with Richenhbach, who had been favored to win-- \nCOLOR ANNOUNCER (V.O.) That was no tangle, he took Richenbach out-- \nRALLY ANNOUNCER We don't know that but I imagine the WRL will be reviewing this crash. \nCOLOR ANNOUNCER That's the third DNF crash Racer's been involved in! Review it? Heck, the oughta just suspend him. \nPOPS Turn it off, Speed! I don't want you watching this anymore. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT \nSpeed tightens his grip on the wheel. \nINT. YOUNG SPEED'S BEDROOM \nSpeed is hidden beneath the blankets, the sound of a small portable television barely audible. \nRACE ANNOUNCER Rex Racer almost took Yokima's head off wit that jump! \nRACE COMMENTATOR There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that Rex Racer is the dirtiest driver in the world. Lit by the soft glow of the small tv, Speed blinks and the first tears slip silently down his cheeks. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT \nHis jaw locks, as he remains trapped between two different forces. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY - PAST \nYoung Speed is clobbering a kid who is twice his size. A teacher finally pulls them apart. \nBIG MOUTH I just told him the truth! His crum-bum brother doesn't belong on a racetrack-- he belongs in jail! Speed tears free and torpedoes Big Mouth again. \nEXT. THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT \nThe two cars continue to dance around each other. \nINT. MEDIA ROW \nLOCAL ANNOUNCER --the trial of Rex Racer shook the World Racing League to tis very \nFOUNDATION--- \nHAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER --once a rat, always a rat and in my book Rex Racer's nuthin' but a \nRAT-- \nAUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER --the indictment brought down perennial racing powerhouse \nUNIROYAL-- \nCHINESE ANNOUNCER --Uniroyal was linked to the notorious fixer Blackjack Benelli-- \nFRENCH ANNOUNCER --still in prison to this day, Benelli was rumored to be behind the Casa Cristo tragedy-- The two cars swerve, heading for a collision as we cut-- \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PAST \nMom, Pops, Sparky, Trixie and Speed are all watching the race on the television. \nCONTINUED: Something happens and Mom drops her glass. It shatters but no one seems to notice. Young Speed is transfixed by the horror of what is playing out, the images of fire and flashing lights, reflecting in his eyes. \nCASA CRISTO ANNOUNCER This has to be one of the worst crashes I have ever seen-- \nINT. PARENTS BEDROOM \nPops is doing his exercises in his gray sweats. \nINT. SPEED'S ROOM \nBEN Speed now sleeps in Rex's old room. The poster of Burns is still tacked to the wall above the bed. Mom opens the door. \nMOM Come on, Champ. Rise and shine. Breakfast's ready. to the Speed's hair.seems to remain asleep, still molded pillow as he tries to push himself up. \nSPEED .I'm up, I'm up. \nINT. KITCHEN \nTHE Mom spatulas another short stack of pancakes from griddle and shovels them like coal into the blazing maw of a locomotive, dumping them onto the plates of Sprittle and Chim-chim. \nCONTINUED: They eat ravenously, trying to secretly steal food from each other's plates while Pops reads from the Racing News. \nPOPS \"It was a virtuoso display of talent, the likes of which has not been seen at Thunderhead since Racer the elder dropped jaws eight. years ago. Now, as we once again, pull our collective jaws up from the floor, we have to ask, will it be different this time, or will \nTRAGEDY-- \nMOM That's enough of that, Hon. Pops puts down the paper and Sparky picks it up. \nSPARKY I just can't believe there wasn't one mention of Racer motors in there. \nPOPS That's because the Sponsors run the media, Sparky. Trixie enters through the back door. \nTRIXIE Mornin' everyone. Is Speed up yet? Speed stumbles in the door. \nSPEED .in spirit anyway. \nTRIXIE Hey superstar, did you see the papers? They're all in love with you. \nSPEED Really? He sits, grabbing the paper. \nSPARKY Yeah, but there sure is a lot of speculation about which team's going to pick him up \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSPEED .really? Speed starts to read and suddenly the room begins to rumble, glasses shaking, plates rattling. \nPOPS What the--? \nSPRITTLE Earthquake! He and Chim-chim begin wailing in panic. \nSPRITTLE (CONT'D) Quick, under the table! Into the door-frame! \nPOPS Sprittle calm down! \nSPEEED Pops the kitchen's the most dangerous room in a house during an earthquake! The whole table shivers and it seems the hanging ceiling light might shake free when the tremor begins to subside. Sprittle and Chim-chim, wearing a pot and a metal colander for protection, look around, expecting something bad to happen. The house becomes pin-prick quiet when-- The doorbell rings. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nPops opens the door to a face full of turbine exhaust from the private K-Harrier jet parked on their front lawn. On their doorstep is an extremely well dressed older man carrying a bouquet of flowers and box of cigars. His smile is as bright and shiny as a surgeon's scalpel. He says, \"Good morning, Mr. And Mrs. Racer\" but no once can hear him over the howl of the turbines. He gestures, asking permission to come in. Pops lets him by and closes the door, immediately reducing the noise. \nCONTINUED: \nWELL DRESSED MAN Mr. And Mrs. Racer, I hope you will forgive this imposition. He hands her the beautiful bouquet of flowers. \nWELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D) These are Blue-belles from EDEN Inc. I'm told the will bloom at least three times, each time a different color. .Mom \"ohhhs\" her appreciation, while he hands over the box of cigars. \nWELL DRESSED MAN (CONT'D) And Mr. Racer these are for you, straight form the Isle of Kamut. Hand-rolled. Premium blend. They glance at each other, a bit takenaback. \nPOPS Uh, thanks but... who are you? He seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces himself. \nWELL DRESSED MAN I am E.P. Arnold Remmingtonton Esquire, President and Chairman of Remmington Industries and it is my honor to meet you both. He reaches for Pops' free hand. \nREMMINGTON Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent admirer of your work for years. I remember the first time I saw the prototype for the Mach-1, I told everyone that it didn't belong on a race track, it belonged in an art museum. Pops chuckles. \nPOPS Yeah, she was a beaut. \nREMMINGTON No, sir. She was a revelation. He suddenly smells the pancakes. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Oh, dear. I interrupted your breakfast. Is that pancakes, I smell? \nMOM Are you hungry, Mr. Remmington? \nREMMINGTON A figure like mine requires constant attention, Mrs. Racer. \nMOM Do you like pancakes? \nREMMINGTON When I was a child we used to say, \"pankuken zin liesben.\" Neither of them speak German. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Pancakes are love. \nINT. KITCHEN \nRemmington stuff another forkful into his mouth and moans his appreciation. Sprittle and Chim--chim sit on either side of him, their gunsel eyes train on his every move. \nREMMINGTON Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer. Superb density. Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon. Absolutely gorgeous. \nGENNIE Hi, Speed. Welcome to Remmington. He shakes her hand while she signals to another man who immediately begins scanning speed with an electronic measuring device. \nSPEED What's this? \nREMMINGTON To make an informed decision you'll need to understand how we take care of our drivers. The tailor finishes quickly as an electric cart, the kind designed for a group tour pulls up. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) All abroad. \nSPRITTLE Cool!. They climb on and the driver pulls into the tramway. \nINT. TRAMWAY \nThese well lit hallways are extra wide with lots of colored guide lines on the floor like. in a hospital. \nCONTINUED: There are a lot of signs, directional and advertisements hawking the widely varied Remmington products. The red lines lead to doors emblazoned with \"Restricted Access.\" There is a fair bit of hustle and bustle, like a busy street as golf carts, seg-ways and motorized scooter zip to and fro. No one walks. \nREMMINGTON Remmington Tower is the crown jewel among the properties that I control. It functions as the corporate headquarters for he top twelve divisions of our parent corp. One big industries family. The turn a corner heading for a large set of doors with the double \"R\" logo of Remmington Racecars. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Of all the 143 companies that I control, none of them is as dear to my heart as the T-180 division. The door opens as they enter--- \nINT. REMMINGTON CAR MUSEUM \nCars from the golden Age through to the present surround the pathway, dangling in midair or mounted in situ- dioramas, each carefully lit with spotlights like works of art or precious gems. \nREMMINGTON I've always felt that it is impossible to peer into the window of Tomorrow without a clear view of the Past. \nSPRITTLE That's the Crystal Horse with the Apache Super--Charger! \nREMINGTON Winner of the Grand Prix in '69, ' 70 and '73. \nCONTINUED: \nSPRITTLE No. Wrong. '72. '71 was the Vundervopper with the K-2 twin turbine and '73 was the Kenobe Motorstar re-built with a VC ;triple chamber. Remmington considers arguing. \nSPEED Don't bother. He's never wrong. They pass out of the museum. \nINT. TRAMWAY \nThe hall widens allowing a special lane that leads out onto an observation deck that over looks the main T-180 factory. The bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility. It is a state of the art assembly line that rises vertically, instead of horizontally. The chassis arrives at the bottom and is born up by a mechanical arm, rotating as each platform assembles the next piece. The far wall is nothing but glass providing a sun- drappled_vista of Cosmopolis. \nREMINGTON Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world. From initial carbon bond to finished car in 36 hours. How long does it take at Racer Motors? \nSPARKY Several weeks at least. Remmington turns to Pops. \nREMINGTON This kind of production facility could be at your disposal, Mr. Racer. The cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway. \nINT. ENERGY-CELL THEATRE \nThe next viewing stage is a window into the vacuumed- sealed laboratory where they construct the \"engine\" that powers the T-180's turbine. It looks like an operating theatre with several robotic arms and a cluster of auto-surgeons operating inside sealed perspec chambers. \nREMMINGTON This is our operating theater where our patented Refusion Energy Distributor Network is installed in the turbine drive. Sparky's eye light up. \nSPARKY Is that an inner-positive transponder? \nREMMINGTON It is indeed. Sparky shoots a look at Pops. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) We control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of Mushi Motors in Taiobi. The window suddenly turns into a mirror. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets. \nINT. TRAMWAY \nThe cart arrives at an elevator station, and the driver presses a signal control the doors opening immediately. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nThe driver punches in a floor and door direction code (north, south, east, west) and the elevator begins to rise while the dais in the floor begins to spin aligning them with a different door. \nCONTINUED: \nREMMINGTON Now, I'll take you up to the Team Remmington training facility. The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first one, decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up- graded lights. The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the halls are decorated. \nINT. TRAINING AQUARIUM \nThe cart glides by a series of windows that reveal the rigorous training systems invented to test the drivers. The first is a multi-level, state-of-the-art fitness facility in which the far wall again looks out into Cosmopolis. Beyond the standard health club fare, there is a Martial Arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid. There is also a range of strange devices ranging from the retro steamer boxes, medicine balls and vibrating belts to the hyper-modern triple axis gyro harness. \nREMMINGTON As you know, a T-180 driver's got to be in peak physical condition. Across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver. She is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to her while several doctors not their approval at the read- outs. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) No expense is spared to make sure that when our driver's suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling. The next window is a massive centrifuge; a huge mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that blasts past the window. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) The best driver must be able to withstand over 4-Gs of force in a typical race. \nCONTINUED: On the opposite wall is the vibration chamber. A man is strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you expect his eyeballs to rattle out. The next window is an underwater tank where a man is driving in a mock up cockpit, executing peddle maneuvers and gear shifts. \nREMINGTON (CONT'D) The will to win is nothing without the will to prepare and at Team Remmington we prepare our drivers for any eventuality and every possible condition. The final window is the weather chamber where a driver is again in a mock cockpit, blue-lipped and shivering while snow and wind buffet him. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nThe doors open and the craft glides in. \nREMMINGTON I hope I didn't care you, Speed with how hard we push our team. I just wanted you to see how serious we are committed to winning. \nSPEED I get that. \nWHACK! WHACK! WHACK! A thug soundly slaps the face ofa handsome Japanese man. When the beating is over, the Japanese man slumps forward, his arms behind his back. \nCRUNCHER Ithought we had a deal... When he hears the voice, he lifts his head and we see a huge man with a body like a cement-lined safe, sitting behind a desk, lighting a cigar. This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) I thought we were friends. He blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the chandelier which is jiggling steadily. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Maybe where you come from, this is how you treat your friends, but 'round here we don't take to kindly to this kind of thing, do we fellas? Thug #1 steps in and wails away on him again. \nTHUG #1 You hurt our feelings! \nCRUNCHER Problem is, I like you Katsu. Cruncher grins, his teeth like stacked dice. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) And I got a real soft spot in my heart for that sister of yours. He begins opening a large package wrapped with butcher paper. -Inside is a bloody rack of ribs. \nCONTINUED: \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Normally in a situation such as this we would be pouring you a nice comfy pair of cement shoes, but... He stands and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is behind the desk. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) I think I got another solution.. He dips the bloody meat into the tank filled with piranha. The water foams as the carnivorous fish shred flesh from bone. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) How're my babies doing? Huh? Hungry? Ready for seconds? Boys! They grab Katsu and haul him to the fishtank. \nKATSU No! \nTHUG #2 Hope dem fishes like Japanese. \nKATSU No, please! \nTHUG #1 Gonna be hard to drive with skellie hands. Cruncher takes hold of Katsu's jaw. \nCRUNCHER You even think about turning rat and next time it's your sister going in there. \nA They begin forcing his hand into the tank when suddenly red light begins flashing. Everyone freezes. Cruncher grabs the phone on his desk. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) What?! \nINT.'TRUCK CAB \nWe realize that Cruncher's office is in the trailer of a semi-truck which is cruising down an empty rural highway. \nTRUCK DRIVER Someone's tailing us. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher signals to the man at the far end of the room who is guarding the door. The guard slides open a peek-a- boo slot and sees a pair of headlights. \nCRUNCHER is it him? \nDOOR GUARD It could be. Cruncher goes to the phone. \nCRUNCHER Can you see him yet? \nTRUCK DRIVER Here he comes-- The car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels his gut clench as he recognizes the infamous car of Racer \nX. \nTRUCK DRIVER (CONT'D) Oh God... \nCRUNCHER Get him! Everyone leaps into action, shoving Katsu back into a chair. Filling their fists with guns, sliding open murder holes slots at a variety of heights. Cruncher barks into the phone. \nCRUNCHER (CONT'D) Crush him! \nINT. TRUCK CAB \nThe driver screws his jaw tight and throws the wheel to smash into the smaller car-- \nCONTINUED: But the little black tinted bug flits away with effortless ease, dancing out in front of the truck. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher flips over the top of his desk revealing the controls for a mini-machine gun located on the bottom of the truck. He grabs the controls which are linked to an infrared sighting camera. \nCRUNCHER Where is he? \nINT. TRUCK CAB \nThe driver watches the red tail-lights glowing like demon eyes. \nTRUCK DRIVER He's out front. \nINT. CRUNCHER BLOCK'S OFFICE \nCruncher, hits another button and he front grill of the truck opens, dropping the lower half like the double- hinged jaw of a snake. An Apache helicopter-style rocket launcher thrusts out of the darkness. Cruncher sights the car. \nCRUNCHER Gotcha. He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car-- But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by, exploding further down the highway. Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris open and the barrels of several weapons extend out. \nTRUCK DRIVER Here he comes! Cruncher fires again, the red rocket just missing, rending open the tree line with a fireball. \nCONTINUED: The little car drops back alongside the truck and fires, bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls of the truck. The truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly at the black car. Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he opens fire-- The black car slows, drawing the chasing gun fire until Cruncher shoots his own tires. \nCRUNCHER Aww, I thought you fixed that! The black car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside, puncturing a hole in the fish tank. \nTHUG #1 Boss! \nSPRITTLE .it doesn't seem fair that I get in trouble, when they always start it. \nSPEED It's not fair. But that's what bullies do. They make the world unfair. \nSPRITTLE That sucks. \nSPEED Yes, it does. \nSPRITTLE What can I do about it? \nSPEED You ignore 'em when you can, fight 'em when you can't. \nSPRITTLE Those choices suck too. \nSPEED Yeah, but just try to keep one thing in mind. \nSPRITTLE What? \nSPEED Bullies come and go but a family can torture you forever. Chim-chim gives Sprittle a wet-willy. \nSPRITTLE Heeeeeey! Speed laughs as Chim-chim howls and then puts his arm around Sprittle. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSPEED But no joke, you just say the word, little brother and we got your back, right Chim-chim? Chim-chim grunts. \nSPRITTLE Thanks guys. \nINT. REMMINGTON INDUSTRIES T-180 FACTORY \nRemmington watches a GRX rolling off the assembly line. With him is Mr. Mushi, a businessman with eyes as sharp as broken glass. \nREMMINGTON The new GRX has a super charged inner-positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off 800 kilometers an hour. Mushi nods. \nMUSHI If such a car were to win the Grand Prix this year, one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically. \nREMMINGTON One would expect. \nMUSHI And if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world, one might expect that company to do very well for itself. \nREMMINGTON You know what I want and I know that for the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival Tetsua Okamoto. The question is, can we make a deal? The car rotates, rising up on its mechanical arm, a cybernetic giant, exercising its might. \nCONTINUED: \nMUSHI Deliver Okamoto at that price and the Taiobi Transponder foundry is yours. \nREMMINGTON Done. Remington smiles as they shake hands. \nINT. MACH 5 \nSpeed and Trixie lie with seats all the way back, \nCAR- watching the sinking sun tye-dye the sky behind the scape of freeways. \nTRIXIE You're really considering signing with Remmington. \nSPEED I just said it was tempting. \nTRIXIE Why? \nSPEED Well, they got a really good team.. Cannonball Taylor, Markie Manifold. They win a lot of Majors. \nTRIXIE Since when did winning become so important? \nSPEED It is important. You gotta win if you want to keep driving and that's what I want to do. It's the only thing I really know how to do. When I'm driving, I feel like that's the only time my life makes sense. She moves closer to him. \nTRIXIE You mean, this doesn't make sense to you? \nSPEED Okay, besides being with you. \nCONTINUED: \nTRIXIE So you like being with me? \nSPEED You know I do. \nTRIXIE Sometimes I do, sometimes I'm not so sure. \nSPEED What? \nTRIXIE Sometimes around your family, you seem distant, not like this and I wonder why. \nSPEED Come on, you know how I've felt about you since I was ten years old. \nTRIXIE I guess so, I just wish you weren't so shy about it. \nSPEED What do you want me to do? Kiss you in front of everyone at the end of a big race? \nTRIXIE Would that be so terrible? \nSPEED I don't know. Maybe we should practice first. \nTRIXIE Maybe we should. They start to kiss when they hear a muted voice. \nCandy wrappers are scattered everywhere as they lay motionless in an overdose coma. When they hear someone coming Sprittle manages to lift his head and crawl to the window. \nCONTINUED: A cleaning man is rising up on a cherry picker with a cart full of cleaning supplies. \nSPRITTLE Uh-oh. He looks back at their mess. \nSPRITTLE (CONT'D) jig's up. A moment later the door opens and the cleaning man enters.. \nCLEANING MAN Holy cooly: He grabs for his radio. \nCLEANING MAN (CONT'D) Hey, this is Marvin down at the landing pad. I think we got mice again. As he talks, two shadows slip quietly out the door behind him. \nINT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE \nSpeed realizes that this is the threshold. \nSPEED This isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink, think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when my brother died, all that went away. I can't tell you how painful that was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn't set foot in his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback. \nCONTINUED: \nSPEED (CONT'D) But one night when I was still pretty young. I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes. \nSPEED (CONT'D) So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns coming round the last turn of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood. Flashback ends. \nSPEED (CONT'D) But for Pops, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that. It's like a religion and in our house, the Major Sponsors are kinda like the devil. The coldness in Remmington's eyes belies his smile. \nSPEED (CONT'D) I don't mean to offend you sir and I do appreciate your offer, it's just, I guess I understand his -point of view and after all we've been through, I don't think this kind of deal is for me. Remmington chuckles. \nREMMINGTON You poor, naive, chump. He chuckles again. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that load of sickening schmaltz and I am going to give you a bit of an education. At the end of it if you're smart, you'll thank me and hen you'll sign that contract. \nINT. TRAMWAY \nSprittle and Chim-chim are joy riding in the maintenance cart, weaving back an forth, wiping people out. Chim-chim screams with glee. \nINT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE \nThey stand before an enlarged black and white photograph of five tycoons, smoking cigars, dressed in turn of the century tycoon finery, their well-fed faces bright with fatuous, self-satisfied smiles. \nREMMINGTON Look. There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing. Benjamin Braddack, Diamond Dave Tweksbury, Reginald White, Oliver Potter, and George Wheeler. The five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century. As he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and photographs of the golden era. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) For all intensive purposes they created the modern automotive industry. But the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the WRL, the world's first racing league. Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos including the first motor of his first car, the first milk bottle from victory lane,.a black and white from an important race. In front of an enlarged picture of Ben Burns from the infamous '43 Prix is a twisted and scorched piece of metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of art. \nCONTINUED: \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Dugazi slugging it out, but who remembers Carl Potts? Driving a rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne . Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF. A forgettable and pathetic finish. So bad, that afterwards Iodyne stock dropped six points. Again we see the history told in flashback. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling cold fresh milk in victory lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately block Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete take-over. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent Iodyne into the gains record book-- the only record book that matters. Look out that window, there isn't a single plane or helicopter or K- Harrier that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars, or drivers. All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money. His greed is as tangible as any drug. \nINT. TRAMWAY \nA security guard glides out of one of the red secured area doors on a segway. \nCONTINUED: His radio buzzes \"perps last seen tramway four, driving a maintenance cart.\" The doors start to close when Sprittle and Chim-chim jump out and sneak inside. \nINT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE \nSpeed doesn't want to hear any more of this, but, Remmington is far from done. \nREMMINGTON Do you understand? Burns knew he was going to win. It was already decided. A week before the Prix, Goldman and Sirrus met with several other major players at the Carlyle Hotel. They met there as they had for years, just as their fathers had met, and as their sons and heirs will still meet. They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix. No race is more important and no race is more controlled. That year Goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if he sold his win to Sirrus, whatever that win might be worth, was nothing compared to what could be gained. He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) That's why I paid three million dollars for this burnt and twisted piece of metal. Because it reminds me of what really matters. This is the true heart of racing boy! This is my religion! Speed is aghast. \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) You don't know how many times I have seen that same cow-eyed \"say it isn't so\" look of disbelief. Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now. I won't bother proving it to you. \nCONTINUED: \nREMMINGTON (CONT'D) If you walk away from me, if you walk out of.this deal, you'll know how true it is soon enough. So, last chance. What's it going to be, Speed? Your father's little fantasy bubble? Or are you going to join the rest of us adults, here in reality? \nINT. TRAMWAY \nSeveral technician carts and trollies carrying auto parts pass by a single lab technician who staggers, drunkenly up to a red restricted area window. Sprittle peaks out of the lower half of the lab coat, Chim-chim wearing the helmet, balances on his shoulder. In the window they see a lab where they are testing a \"spear---hook;\" a secret attacking device that shoots out from one car and grabs hold of the undercarriage of another car. As they realize what they are looking at, a security goon comes gliding up behind them on his seg-way. \nINT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE \nSpeed hands him the brown paper bag. \nREMMINGTON What's this? He looks and sees the shoes and suit. \nSPEED If that's your idea of racing, you can keep it. \nREMMINGTON Listen to me and listen good kid, because I'm going to give you one more history lesson. You're going to go to Fuji-- In quick, collage cuts we see -- \nEXT. FUJI HELEXICON \nA gorgeous blimp shot of the race track which takes up an entire island of Hawaii-like archipelago. The track weaves in and out of the lush tropical landscape set against the ocean shimmering with sequins of sunlight. \nEXT.

Speed turns and heads for the elevator. \nREMMINGTON DRIVER Yes and then you'll realize that you just made the biggest mistake of your life! \nTNT. RACER KITCHEN -MORNING Close up on The Racing News that Sparky is reading from. The main headline: ANOTHER DIRTY RACER? \nCONTINUED: \nSPARKY \". .controversy surrounds Racer Motors now embroiled in IP litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not Speed used an illegal device, the Fuji Helexicon seems destined to become another mark of shame added to the notorious Racer family legacy, a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this beloved sport.\" \nMOM Sparky. That's enough. \nSPARKY Sorry ma'am. \nSPRITTLE I'm going to send that guy some Chim-chim cookies. Chim-chim guffaws. \nPOPS You'll do no such thing. \nSPRITTLE We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps into the doorway. \nSPEED This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him. \nSPARKY You mean Remmington? \nSPEED He said it'd get worse and worse and by the end of the year you'd be filing for bankruptcy, Pops. \nSPRITTLE Okay, he's definitely gettin' some monkey cookies. \nMOM Sprittle! \nCONTINUED: (2 \nPOPS He was just trying to scare you, son. They tried the same thing with Rex. If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get. \nSPEED How? What can we do? How can we fight this? He tosses the newspaper. \nPOPS The truth will come out. \nSPEED The truth? Don't be naive, Pops. He leaves. \nINT. SPEED'S ROOM \nThe Ben Burns poster is ripped from the wall. Speed wads its up and throws it into the garbage. He sinks down to his bed, a sense of powerlessness crushing the life out of him. Mom taps and then cracks the door. \nMOM Speed? Are you okay? \nSPEED .I don't know. She comes in and sits beside him, putting her arm around him. \nMOM It'll be okay. We'll get through it. \nSPEED I don't know, mom. I might have really messed things up. \nMOM How? \nSPEED By not joining Remmington. \nCONTINUED: \nMOM Don't be silly. You'd have never been happy driving for that terrible man. \nSPEED But maybe racing isn't about being happy. Maybe Remmington's right and it's all about business and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump. \nMOM Now you listen to me, young man. What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car. \nSPEED .I loved that old wagon. \nMOM And do you remember the time Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive-- Speed smiles. \nSPEED And I turned it over. \nMOM My heart still pounds just thinking about it. \nSPEED Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks. \nMOM I thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile. \nINT. RACER LIVING ROOM - PAST \nTen year old Speed comes in the door, leading Rex, wearing a small bandage on his forehead, smiling, a big black gap where his two front teeth should be. \nMOM I don't think I ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash. \nINT. SPEED'S ROOM - PRESENT \nMOM Speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do, I feel like I'm watching someone paint or play music. When I go to the races, I go to watch you make art and it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you just take my breath away and it's at those moments, when I feel your father's chest swell and I know he's smiling, trying to pretend he doesn't have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces. \nMIND-- He starts to take out his card. \nPOPS Keep your card, Chief Inspector. \nCONTINUED: (3) Speed looks at Pops, then realizes that Racer X is staring straight at him. \nEXT. INSPIRATION POINT - NIGHT \nIt is raining, the cockpit bubble smeared with the distant traffic lights. \nSPEED And the way he was looking at me, I don't know...I just gotta do something. \nTRIXIE But Pops will never let you go. \nSPEED He won't if I ask him. \nTRIXIE Speed Racer what are you thinking? \nSPEED You weren't in Remmington's office, Trix. You don't know what it was like. It felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me. \nTRIXIE I hate him. I'm picturing his heart clogging with cholesterol right now. \nSPEED No joke, Trix. If you could have been in that room, you'd want to do anything you could to take this guy down. She looks straight into his eyes and he doesn't have to say anything else. \nTRIXIE All right. Let's do it. You're going to need an alibi. We'll say we're going skiing. \nSPEED What? No way! \nCONTINUED: \nTRIXIE You're going to need my help. Casa Cristo is a rally. I can spot from a 'copter. \nSPEED Trixie, this isn't a game. These people play rough. \nTRIXIE I know. That's why I'm coming with you. And if you even try to argue with me, I'll tell Pops right now and he won't let you out of his sight. \nSPEED You would, wouldn't you? He looks into her eyes and knows the answer. \nSPEED (CONT'D) Well...I guess we're going skiing. She smiles. \nINT. REMMINGTON'S OFFICE \nRemmington sits surrounded by the legal equivalent of knights, bishops and rooks while Mr. Mushi sits across from him supported by his own retinue. Behind them, Cannonball Taylor blasts through the test course fast enough to coax a low rumble from the sound barrier. \nREMMINGTON As I'm sure you're aware, the Okamoto stock fell another four points yesterday. In the next few days it will hit bottom and they will have to sell. The car roars through its elliptical path like a circling electron binding the two tycoons together. \nMUSHI This could be a most profitable year for Remmington. Remmington can't hide the glow. \nCONTINUED: \nREMMINGTON Mushi won't do too badly either. Mushi nods. Cannonball circles, everything in apparent harmony until Gennie leans in and whispers. \nGENNIE.

I just gotta get away from here. \nSPRITTLE Why? \nSPEED Because. \nSPRITTLE Because why? \nSPEED Because I have to. \nSPRITTLE Can we come with you? Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu. \nSPEED What? \nSPRITTLE Can we come with you? \nSPEED No. \nSPRITTLE Why? \nSPEED You'll understand when it's your turn. He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door. \nINT. RACER FAMILY LIVING ROOM \nthere, Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already sitting, waiting, a heaviness in his.limbs. \nCONTINUED: \nPOPS Speed, before you go, I'd like to say a few things. Will you sit with your old man for a minute? Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag. \nSPEED Don't try to stop me. \nPOPS I won't. I made a mistake trying to tell you what to do at Cortega. You were right. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again. Speed sits. \nPOPS (CONT'D) I want you to know that I acted rashly. I said things I wish I hadn't. Your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of my self but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I did a pretty good job of it. I wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was. \nSPEED Thanks. \nPOPS The truth was, I couldn't have been more proud of you son. Not because you won, but because you stood up, you weren't afraid and you did what you thought was right. \nSPEED So? It didn't amount to anything. It was completely meaningless. \nPOPS How could it be meaningless? I saw my son become a man. I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off of every driver on the road. This is not meaningless. This is the reason for a father's life. Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPOPS (CONT'D) I admit I went to Cortega because I was afraid that what happened to Rex was going to happen to you. And I just couldn't take that. I couldn't loose another one of my boys like that again. But what I realize in Cortega was that I didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I lost him here. I lost him when he walked out of this house and I let him go without telling him how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did. You'll never know how much I regret that mistake, but it's enough that I'll never make it again. He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him. \nPOPS (CONT'D) I love you Speed. I understand that every child leaves home but I want you to know that door is always open and you can always come back. \nSPEED I love you Pops. I'm just so confused right now. I don't what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm locked up in some kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense. \nPOPS I know what that's like. When Rex died I didn't even. know if I wanted salt on my eggs, let alone if I wanted to keep building cars. Then, do you remember when we sat here, that night, watching old Ben Burns and Dugazi? You remember that? Speednods vaguely. \nPOPS (CONT'D) Sittin' here, cheering with you, something just clicked, like a light being switched on inside of me and after that, I never had trouble remembering how I liked me eggs. \nCONTINUED: (3) \nSPEED Jeez Pops. That's just it. That's part of my problem. \nPOPS What? \nSPEED That race. The '43 Prix. Burns and Dugazi? It was fixed. Remmington told me the whole story. It was all about some DNF names Rotts. They've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed. That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow. \nPOPS I don't believe that. Remmington's a crook. You can't believe a crook. \nSPEED I don't think he was lying, Pops. \nPOPS The Grand Prix? A sham? Ding dong. \nPOPS (CONT'D) Who could that be? \nWITH Speed opens the door. She seems to glow, radiating her own incandescence. \nSPEED Horuko?! \nHORUKO Forgive me for intruding but I had to come before it was too late. Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another set-up. \nHORUKO (CONT'D) This is not a trick. I swear to you. I am not my brother. \nPOPS You going to ask the lovely lady in? \nCONTINUED: (4) \nSPEED Yeah, sure. Come on in. She steps in, looking somewhat out of place in the suburban living room. \nPOPS Can I get you something to drink? \nHORUKO No. My security man believes I am still at the opera, so I only have a moment.

We have verified it. \nREMMINGTON Where did you get that? \nSPEED I was on the Okamoto team remember? I won it fair and square. \nREMMINGTON This is preposterous! He can't be allowed to race. It's too late. \nINSPECTOR DETECTOR The ruling on this is quite clear. Try to stop it and you'll be in blatant violation of the WRL charter, leaving me no option but to shut this years Prix down until a full investigation can be completed. \nREMMINGTON What?!

GRAND PRIX \nAgain we cut to the many varied expressions of anticipation: Trixie, Mushi, Okamoto, Sprittle, and Chim- chim, Katsu and Horuko, Mom and Pops, Remmington and Racer X who no longer has any socks, until-- The gun sounds-- The cars become bullets hurdled forward, except for the car in front of Speed which barely moves blocking his \nPATH-- He tries to avoid it but can't, rear-ending him while the car behind him slams into the back of the Mach 5. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES Trouble at the start, a misfire traps Speed Racer, causing a \nCOLLISION-- \nBEN BURNS Uh-oh. Look out! \nEXT. GRAND PRIX STARTING LINE \nA car to the side swerves aiming straight at Speed who manages at the last second a slip-jack jump-- Flipping over the car as it slams into the pile-up while-- Speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the track there is a scream of burning rubber and the Mach 5 rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES I don't know how he got out of that one-- \nBEN BURNS That-kid's wiley. \nEXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK \nThe first lap of the Grand Prix is Ben Hur brutal as car after car takes a shot at Speed but-- He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other-- Littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing cocoons. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \n", "test3_true": "CASS JONES Speed fakes left, jumps right-- \nBEN BURNS Nice, nice-- \nCONTINUED: \nCASS JONES He slips in behind Gearbox--- \nBEN BURNS Here comes over under-- \nEXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK \nSpeed executes another beautiful maneuver sending Gearbox crashing into Boom-Boom-- Both cars going boom-boom, their rubber cocoons bouncing free. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nBen Burns is giddy with glee. \nBEN BURNS I told you! I told you! \nCASS JONES Speed Racer seems unstoppable, moving up from dead last, nearing the leaders as they head into the slalom with the Gray Ghost battling Prince Kabala and Cannonball Taylor for the lead. \nEXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK \nThe Prince tries to sight the Ghost in his mirrors but the Gray Ghost seems to vanish. \nGRAY GHOST Where am I? Where am I? I'm here. I am over there. I'm Savior Faire! The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he can't seem to locate him. \nGRAY GHOST (CONT'D) I'm everywhere, baby! Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro-- Shattering the Prince's car like a mis-struck diamond reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust. \nCONTINUED: The two more cocoons bounce onto the road as the other cars roar past. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES A spectacular crash as the Prince's jewel-covered Gigerbon worth an estimated 22 million dollars is scattered over a quarter mile of track. \nBEN BURNS I'd like to work clean up on that crash. They chuckle. \nCASS JONES But look out, as they approach the Big Drop, here comes Speed Racer? \nEXT. THE BIG DROP \nThe cars head over as though falling off the end of Niagara and while other drivers cling to their steering wheels just trying to hang on-- Speed presses the accelerator, making his move-- Banking higher than anyone up the big wall and when he dives back down there are only three cars left ahead of \nHIM-- The green Mushi motors car, the Gray Ghost, and the Black \nGRX. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES Speed Racer is knocking on the door of the new GRX driven by Cannonball Taylor. \nBEN BURNS You hoot Anybody home? \nINT. MACH 5 \nSPEED Ok Mr. Two Time Grand Prix, Five time WRL, future Hall of Fame, teach me something. \nEXT. GRAND PRIX TRACK \nSpeed makes a move and Cannonball blocks, but it is clumsy and Speed quickly counters-- Bouncing Cannonball into the wall. \nSPEED Come on! Is that it? He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it is immediately clear who is the better driver, as-- Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the other. \nTNT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES Cannonball Taylor is in trouble. \nBEN BURNS Tear `em up kid! \nINT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE \nThe knuckles of Remmington's fist crackle as he wrings the tension. \nREMMINGTON Do it. Stop him. Stop him now. \nINT. MACH 5 \nSPEED Lesson's over. See you at the finish line. Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does-- \nCONTINUED: Cannonball throws a hidden switch and under the two cars a spear hook shoots out and locks onto the Mach 5 undercarriage. Speed feels it and knows what happened immediately. \nSPEED (CONT'D) No! \nSPARKY What is it? \nSPEED Spear hook! He's got me! Cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall, grinding against the Mach 5 while the trailing cars shoot post. \nINT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH \nCASS JONES Cannonball has Speed pinned as they grind through the butterfly turn. \n", "test3_id": 107}

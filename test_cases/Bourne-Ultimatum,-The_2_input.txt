NICKY It was difficult for me...with you. 
BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause... 
NICKY (CONT'D) You really don't remember anything? 
BOURNE No. 
NICKY'S face. 
Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe. 
BOURNE (CONT'D) We should move. 
They get up and leave... 
145A   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                             145A 
Vosen goes to his safe. 
VOSEN (to voiceprint mic) Noah Vosen. 
Then he puts his thumb into a print reader. The safe door pops open. He pulls out a file marked "Top Secret." 
145B   INT. DAY.    LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI                     145B 
CRONIN makes his way down the hallway. 
LANDY works at her desk.       CRONIN enters... 
CRONIN They tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier. They're holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from Casablanca. 
Off LANDY.    This just keeps getting worse... 
145C   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                    145C 
Landy enters without knocking. 
LANDY Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels? 
VOSEN Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco! 
LANDY So grab him-- 
VOSEN I don't have the people on the ground to do that and I'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands. 
LANDY What's going on?    What's Daniels got? 
VOSEN What's he got? He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa. 
LANDY I think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, Noah. 
VOSEN For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook. Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets..... 
LANDY You still don't have the authority to kill him. 
VOSEN Oh, yes I do, Pam. 
Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe. It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol." 
VOSEN That's what makes us special. No red tape. No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order. 
Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous lethal action is authorized when..." 
LANDY You just decide? No oversight. No checks and balances. 
VOSEN Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw intel. You know how real the threat is.    We can't afford to have our hands tied like that anymore.

FADE IN: 
TELEPHONE ROOM 
It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written) 
We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.

CUT TO: 
CONFERENCE ROOM 
Telephone bell ringing. 
General shot. 
Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, smoking and waiting. 
GERSTENKORN (glances at watch) Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting. 
SCHWEIMANN (who has returned) He likes to play the great man. 
WAITZ (glancing at market report from table) The Preysing stock is holding its own today on the market. 
SCHWEIMANN Ask Preysing what it's costing him to keep it up. 
GERSTENKORN And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down. 
WAITZ Exactly. 
GERSTENKORN If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself. 
WAITZ Shhh -- here he is now. 
The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men. 
FLAEMMCHEN (beams) Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. Preysing will be here in a minute. 
Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen. 
Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again. 
Door opens suddenly. 
PREYSING (enters) Good morning, gentlemen. 
MEN Good morning. 
PREYSING Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor. 
WAITZ Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple. 
GERSTENKORN Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it? 
PREYSING (disturbed) What? 
GERSTENKORN (quickly) They turn out marvelous material in Manchester. 
PREYSING Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything? 
Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for work is seen in several CLOSEUPS: 
SCHWEIMANN (with a wink to Gerstenkorn) Manchester is a very interesting city, don't you think so, Preysing? 
PREYSING (stalling) Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in the textile industry naturally has to know Manchester. 
GERSTENKORN There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester? 
PREYSING (quickly) We have a good many connections in England, naturally. 
GERSTENKORN I mean with the Manchester people? 
PREYSING (looking at Gerstenkorn impudently) We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning. 
GERSTENKORN (winking at Schweimann) All right. 
PREYSING (far-away commencing to read his report) Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.

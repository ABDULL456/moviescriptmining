ANNIE ... the phone company's putting in extra lines. I'll call back with the numbers. Oh, and I want you to get in touch with this lady in town here -- they say she's sort of a physical therapist for the rodeo boys but keep the one at the hospital we already contacted on call... 
Grace sits alone in the living room. Watching TV, but anxious and disturbed about what she's committed herself to. 
INT. DOUBLE DIVIDE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
Diane is in her bathrobe doing bills at the kitchen table, as she listens to a BOOK OF TAPE. Her hand on her forehead, her other hand writing. Tom enters to take his hat off the sideboard. He moves to the table and reaches over for a cookie from a plate of cookies. Without looking up, Diane slaps his hand. Tom then pours himself a cup of coffee... then swiftly sneaks his hand back and grabs a cookie. Diane smiles. Tom exits. 
It is only then that Diane looks up after him. 
INT. UPPER FLOOR OF RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT 
Camera follows Tom towards his bedroom --  passing the others. Perhaps we see Frank sprawled out asleep already in his underwear. We might see the Twins in their bunks. One of the Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket. He casually flips the blanket over the kid's bare feet and continues to his room. 
INT. TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Tom enters and closes the door. Turns on a stereo which plays a cello piece by Yo-Yo Ma. Books fills his room. He sits at his desk, puts on eye glasses and looks through some paperwork. Suddenly he stops, looking over the paperwork, into space. A thought passes by. We don't know what. 
FADE OUT: 
EXT. THE RANCH, A CORRAL - DAYBREAK 
First light of day. Pilgrim stands stock still in the middle of the corral. Tom, motionless, is crouched on his haunches in the corral -- watching him. 
TOM'S POV: As Pilgrim moves, he can see that the horse is stove up. 
He softly tosses a handful of dirt at Pilgrim's withered legs... Pilgrim, sensitive to the slightest provocation, bucks, wheeling away from him. Then stops. Tom sits on his haunches again... and watches him. 
Frank appears, exiting from the barn (perhaps). 
FRANK Tom? 
TOM Yeah. 
Tom leaves Pilgrim, hooking up with Frank -- the two brothers go off, discussing the ranch work that is ahead of them. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE RANCH - ANOTHER DAY 
Annie and Grace arrive in the Suburban. They exit. As they head towards the ranch, they see in the distance: 
Pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen. Tom stands in the pen, holding a rope, looking at Pilgrim. 
EXT. THE ROUND PEN - DAY 
Tom stands in the pen with Pilgrim. He looks to see Annie and Grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement. He turns his focus back to Pilgrim. 
Annie and Grace appear. Grace takes a position (that is to become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen. Annie moves in closer, beside SMOKEY (a ranch hand) with one leg up on the pen fence. 
SMOKEY Howdy... (sees Grace) Howdy. 
He and Annie watch as Tom stands before Pilgrim -- turning sideways... then standing... 
ANNIE What's he doing? 
SMOKEY Trying to get his eye. 
ANNIE How's it going? 
Smokey doesn't respond -- how it's going is exactly how it looks. Tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again. We sense the process is long and requires great patience. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ROUND PEN - DAY 
Two hours later. Grace is in the same spot. Smokey is gone, doing his work. Annie has taken a different position, looking over SEVERAL PAGES OF FAXES on her lap. 
Tom is still standing in the pen trying to get Pilgrim's eyes. 
Joe has joined the proceedings, sitting on the pen rail. 
Tom deftly throws a hoolihan, gently lassoing Pilgrim around the neck. And Pilgrim, at the touch of the rope, crazed, resists, pulling back, striking at the rope... The rope cutting into Tom's hands. Tom gives him some slack, giving his head, letting him relax... then gently heads him by the rope, walking him around the pen, getting his feet to moving. 
Grace's eyes never leave Tom. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY 
Tom, off in the distance -- against a sky that seems to be touching the land -- is riding along a creek. Closer up, we see he's rustling the bushes with a stick. Some stray cows run out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside. 
At the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly before him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom whistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup truck is parked on the range. 
Joe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back of the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food. What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them. 
Tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in the distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road to the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out of the car with Grace. Annie instinctively turns and looks across the land. Even though there is such a distance, there's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other. 
Tom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the range -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following. Tom sits on his horse atop the hill. 
EXT. THE DOUBLE DIVIDE - ANOTHER DAY 
Pilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming. We discover he is in a pond, tethered to a pole... Except for the sound of his legs in the water, everything is quiet and focused on Pilgrim. 
SMOKEY, holds the pole, walking on the outside of the pond, leading Pilgrim back and forth as he swims. Tom, crouched by the pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim... 
Grace watches, off by herself... Annie stands beside Joe. She can't help but be intrigued by the sight. She asks Joe; 
ANNIE I though horses were afraid of water? 
Joe doesn't answer her. Grace likes that. Annie, frustrated, feels she has the right to simple shout out to Tom. 
ANNIE Is that to get his strength back? 
Tom pays her no mind -- concentrating on Pilgrim. 
Suddenly, Annie's CELL PHONE rings, jarring the proceedings. Tom turns to Annie. She hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. Tom turns back to Pilgrim. After a few moments -- 
Tom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful, fights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out of the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly. 
Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond. 
Tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab Pilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope again. Pilgrim rears again. Tom stumbles backwards from his hooves. Annie gasps. Grace turns to walk away from the pond. She can't watch -- it brings back too much. But as she does, she is stopped by the sight of --

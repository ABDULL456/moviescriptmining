WADE I wish you would die. 
Pop spits directly into Wade's face, raises his arm. Wade catches it, twists it. Margie shrieks: 
MARGIE Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it! 
They do, glaring as they approach the farmhouse. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Wade looks in the bedroom, sees Margie sleeping, goes to the bathroom. 
He peers, stands before the sink, washes his hands slowly. Drying his hands, he looks into the mirror, startled by the image of his own face. 
A phone conversation plays over: 
WADE (O.S.) No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and there he was, only it was me. But it was like I had never seen myself before. It was a stranger's face. Hard to explain. You fly on automatic pilot, like I was doing all night, and you disappear. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Wade sits alone in the darkened room, speaking on the phone. His cigarette glows. 
WADE Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another. 
ROLFE (O.S.) Wade, are you alright? 
WADE But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Wade's theory expanded: Jack and Gordon argue in the office. An extension of Scene 55. Like Wade's other theories, in black-and-white: 
LARIVIERE He's on to us! 
JACK Shit! What are we gonna do? 
LARIVIERE Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel. 
JACK You can't buy Wade off. 
LARIVIERE We bought you. 
JACK That was me. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALMA PITTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
Wade drives Margie's car toward LaRiviere's. In his rear view window he spots Chick Ward driving Chub Merritt's tow truck, lights blinking, pulling LaRiviere's pickup like a dead fish. 
He pulls over, lets it pass. He's parked in front of Alma Pittman's house. A sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman, Town Clerk." 
He looks at the house, decides to go in. Wade walks up the shoveled steps, knocks on the door. ALMA, 60, wearing plaid shirt and slacks, greets him with a smile: 
ALMA Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.

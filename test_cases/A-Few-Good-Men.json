{"test1_input": "A FEW GOOD MEN \nWritten by \nAaron Sorkin \nRevised Third Draft \nJuly 15, 1991 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A SENTRY TOWER -- \n-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. \nSmall beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT POST, maybe forty feet off the ground. \nStanding the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding a rifle and staring straight out. \nThe drum cadence has been building slightly. \nCUT TO: \nA WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into the distance. \nSUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA. \nThe drum cadence continues, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. A MARINE BARRACKS \nWe HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then \nCUT TO: \nTHE BARRACKS CORRIDOR \nwhere we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into \nINT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in his bunk. \nDAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong -- \n-- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth. \nEverything that happens next occurs with speed, precision and professionalism. \n-- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto his mouth and eyes -- \n-- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet. \nDOWNEY (quietly) You're lucky it's us, Willy. \n-- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking him, just holding his head still -- \n-- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four sharp blasts from a whistle and we \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY \nand the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished silver and brass. \nThe BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS. \nAs the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works. \nSUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C. \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY \nIt's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS enter and exit and \nCUT TO: \nA WOMAN \nas she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building. The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ... \nJO I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, I'd like to request that I be the attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent -- (she stops) \"That it be myself who is assigned to represent\"? ...Good, Jo, that's confidence inspiring. \nWe follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick building which bears the seal of the \nUNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS \nCUT TO: \nINT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY \nAs JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table. \nGIBBS Jo, come on in. \nJO Thank you, sir. \n", "test1_true": "JO Yes sir. (to WEST) Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on such short notice. \nWEST I understand there was some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba. \nJO Yes sir... This past Friday evening. Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon. \nLAWRENCE What's the problem? \nJO Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screw-up. I was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red. \nJo lets this sink in a moment. \nWEST (under his breath) Christ. \nJO I'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that... I be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them. (beat) Myself. \nJo looks around the room for a response. \nWEST Joanne, why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee. \nJO Thank you, sir, I'm fine. \nWEST Joanne, I'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back. \nJO Certainly, sir. \nJO gets up and walks out. \nWEST I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore. \nLAWRENCE With the marines at GITMO? Who the hell knows what goes on down there. \nWEST Well lets find out before the rest of the world does, this thing could get messy. What about this woman? \nLAWRENCE Jo's been working a desk at internal affairs for what, almost a year now. \nWEST And before that? \nGIBBS She disposed of three cases in two years. \nWEST Three cases in two years? Who was she handling, the Rosenbergs? \nGIBBS She's not cut out for litigation. \nLAWRENCE She's a hall of an investigator, Jerry -- \nGIBBS In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of 'em, but when it comes to trial work -- \nWEST I know. All passion, no street smarts. Bring her back in. \nLAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back in. \nWEST (continuing) Commander, we're gonna move the defendants up here in the morning. \nJO Thank you, sir. \nWEST And I'll have Division assign them counsel... \nJO (beat) But... not me. \nWEST From what I understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what I'm sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week's worth of paper work. \nJO Sir -- \nWEST Don't worry about it. I promise you, division'll assign the right man for the job. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY \nTHE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB \nHis name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own against a group of, say, Airforce dentists. \nKAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, passionate about nothing... except maybe softball. \nKAFFEE (calling out to the team) Alright, let's get two! \nHe smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right between his legs. \nSECOND BASE Sorry! \nKAFFEE Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Just look the ball into your glove. \nHe smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel of SHERBY's glove and into center field. \nSECOND BASE (SHERBY) Sorry! \nKAFFEE You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep your eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of ten. \nSPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, walks up behind the backstop. \nSPRADLING Kaffee! \nKAFFEE Let's try it again. \nSPRADLING Kaffee!! \nKAFFEE (turning) Dave. You seem upset and distraught. \nSPRADLING We were supposed to meet in your office 15 minutes ago to talk about the McDermott case. You're stalling on this thing. Now we got this done and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' yardarm. \nKAFFEE A yardarm? (calling out) Sherby, does the Navy still hang people from yardarms? \n", "test1_id": 2985, "test2_input": "JO Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation. \nKAFFEE Why are you always giving me your resume? \nJO Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer. \nKAFFEE I do. \nJO No you don't. (beat) I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you. \nKAFFEE (pause) Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. (beat) Ross's opening speech, it was all true. (beat) I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. (beat) We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder. \nJO We'll find Markinson. \nKAFFEE Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge. \nWe HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear \nHOWARD (V.O.) Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nCUT TO: \nCORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around Cuba, is on the stand. \nKAFFEE Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red? \nHOWARD Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run... \nKAFFEE Have you ever received a code red? \nHOWARD Yes sir. We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped. It's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and I'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught. \nKAFFEE And what happened? \nHOWARD That night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes. Then they poured glue on my hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I ain't never dropped my weapon since. \nKAFFEE Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Was his barracks ever in disorder? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Did he ever fall back on a run? \nHOWARD All the time, sir. \nKAFFEE Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red? \nHOWARD No sir. \nKAFFEE (beat) Never? \nHOWARD No, sir. \nKAFFEE You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one? \nHOWARD Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir. \nKAFFEE Dawson wouldn't allow it. \nHOWARD The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him. They were too afraid of Dawson, sir. \nROSS Object. The witness is characterizing. \nKAFFEE I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Why didn't you? \nHOWARD 'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir. \nKAFFEE Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now. \nROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on the table. He brings one to HOWARD. \nROSS Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nROSS Have you read it? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nROSS Good. (hands him the book) Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please. \nHOWARD Sir? \nROSS Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds. \nHOWARD Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use -- it's just used down at GITMO, sir. I don't know if it actually -- \nROSS has produced another book. \nROSS We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct? \nHOWARD No sir. \nROSS No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds? \nHOWARD (pause) No sir. No books, sir. \nROSS No further questions. \n", "test2_true": "KAFFEE Corporal, would you turn to the page in this book that says where the enlisted men's mess hall is? \nHOWARD Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir. \nKAFFEE I don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book? \nHOWARD I guess I just followed the crowd at chow time, sir. \nKAFFEE No more questions. \nKAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk. \nRANDOLPH Corporal Howard, you can step down. \nHOWARD (greatly relieved) Thank you, sir. \nKAFFEE gives HOWARD a subtle \"You Did Good, Kid\" look, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK \nIt's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the hall with SAM and JO. \nKAFFEE Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review. I want to slam- dunk this guy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT \nKAFFEE'S CAR \nas it drives along a street in the D.C. business district. it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and runs to the stand. \nKAFFEE Hey, Luther. \nLUTHER Admiral, how's the big case goin'? \nKAFFEE Nose to the grindstone. \nLUTHER No flies on you. \nKAFFEE A rolling stone gathers no moss. \nLUTHER Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat lady sings. \nKAFFEE Ain't that the truth. Catch you tomorrow. \nHe gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does \n-- a hand is slapped over his mouth -- \nVOICE (O.S.) It's Matthew Markinson. \n-- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin. \nBecause sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is MARKINSON. \nKAFFEE Jesus fucking Christ!!-- \nMARKINSON You left the door unlocked. \nKAFFEE Scared the shit outta me. \nMARKINSON Drive. \nKAFFEE Are you aware you're under subpoena? \nMARKINSON Yes. I'm also aware that the lives of two marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that, I would, but since I can't, all I can do is help you. Why don't you drive, Lieutenant. \nKAFFEE begins driving down the street. \nKAFFEE What do you know? \nMARKINSON I know everything. \nKAFFEE Was it a code red? \nMARKINSON Yes. \nKAFFEE Did Kendrick give the order? \nMARKINSON Yes. \nKAFFEE Did you witness it? \nMARKINSON I didn't need to -- \nKAFFEE Did you witness it?! \nMARKINSON No. \nKAFFEE Then how do you know? \nMARKINSON I know. \nKAFFEE You know shit. \nMARKINSON He was never gonna be transferred off the base. \nAnd with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He turns to Markinson. \nMARKINSON (continuing) Jessep was going to keep him on the base. He said he wanted him trained. \n", "test2_id": 2986, "test3_input": "JO How're you feeling? \nKAFFEE I think he's gonna have his hands full today. \nJO Listen. (beat) Danny. (beat) When you're out there. If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it (beat) ...don't go for it. \nKAFFEE looks at her. \nJO (continuing) If you feel like... if you feel like... You could get in trouble. (beat) I'm special counsel for internal affairs, and I'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble. \nKAFFEE Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are you suggesting I back off a material witness? \nJO If you think you can't get him. (beat) Yeah. \nKAFFEE Do you think I can get him? \nJO (beat) I think it doesn't matter what I think. I'm an administrator. (beat) I can't seem to defend people. \nKAFFEE takes that in. He picks up his briefcase and grabs his jacket. \nThen he turns to JO. \nKAFFEE You're my hero, Joanne. (beat) From the first day, you were a lawyer. (beat) Live with that. \nAnd in VOICE OVER we HEAR the SERGEANT AT ARMS. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS (V.O.) All rise. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE COURTROOM - DAY \nEveryone stands at attention as RANDOLPH enters. SAM is missing. \nRANDOLPH (to KAFFEE) Call your witness. \nKAFFEE Where's Sam? \nJO He'll be here. \nRANDOLPH Lieutenant, call your witness. \nKAFFEE Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep. \nJESSEP is escorted in through a side door. He's wearing his dress uniforms, adorned with the appropriate medals. \nROSS Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General Court-Martial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? \nJESSEP Yes I do. \nROSS Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air? \nJESSEP Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nROSS Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please. \nJESSEP sits. \nKAFFEE Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson. \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right? \nROSS Objection. I'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying? \nKAFFEE I'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive. \nROSS Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information. \nKAFFEE I just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol. \nAnd from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the defense table. \nOver this we HEAR -- \nRANDOLPH (O.S.) The witness is aware, the Court is aware, and now the jury is aware. We thank you for bringing this to our attention. Move on Lieutenant. \nSAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH. \nKAFFEE Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right? \nJESSEP I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched. \nKAFFEE And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well? \nJESSEP I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately. \nKAFFEE Why? \nJESSEP I felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out. \nKAFFEE Grave danger? \nJESSEP Is there another kind? \nKAFFEE holds up a document from his table. \nKAFFEE We have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight off the bass? \nJESSEP The six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base. \n", "test3_true": "JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting out in the courtroom. \nKAFFEE Colonel, you flew up to Washington early this morning, is that right? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE I notice you're wearing your Class A appearance in dress uniform for court today. \nJESSEP (continuing) As are you, Lieutenant. \nKAFFEE Did you wear that uniform on the plane? \nROSS Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to anything in particular? \nKAFFEE The defense didn't have an opportunity to depose this witness, your honor. I'd ask the Court for a little latitude. \nRANDOLPH A very little latitude. \nKAFFEE Colonel? \nJESSEP I wore fatigues on the plane. \nKAFFEE And you brought your dress uniform with you. \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? Change of underwear? \nROSS Your honor. \nKAFFEE (to ROSS) Is the Colonel's underwear a matter of national security? \nRANDOLPH Gentlemen. (to KAFFEE) You better get somewhere fast with this, Lieutenant. \nKAFFEE Yes sir. Colonel? \nJESSEP I brought a change of clothes and some personal items. \nKAFFEE Thank you. \nKAFFEE gets a document from his table. \nKAFFEE (continuing) After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the sixth, Santiago's barracks room was sealed off and its contents inventoried. (reading) Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2 pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki tee-shirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater -- \nROSS Please the Court, is there a question anywhere in our future? \nRANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee, I have to -- \nKAFFEE I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed. \nThat landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS... \nKAFFEE (continuing) I'll tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute. \nJO hands KAFFEE the computer printout. \nKAFFEE (continuing) This is a record of all telephone calls made from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to Washington, you made three calls. \nHanding Jessep the printout -- \nKAFFEE (continuing) I've highlighted those calls in yellow. Do you recognize those numbers? \nJESSEP I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him know I'd be in town. The second call was to set up a meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee, and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth. \nKAFFEE Why did you make that call, sir? \nJESSEP I thought she might like to have dinner tonight. \nROSS Judge -- \nRANDOLPH I'm gonna put a stop to this now. \nJo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters. \nKAFFEE Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. (to JESSEP) Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel. \nROSS Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies. \nRANDOLPH ponders this a moment. \nRANDOLPH (pause) Overruled. \nROSS Your honor -- \nRANDOLPH The objection's noted. \nKAFFEE (beat) Colonel? \nJessep's smiling... \n...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Is this funny, sir? \nJESSEP No. It's not. It's tragic. \nKAFFEE Do you have an answer? \nJESSEP Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago.  What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer? Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill. (beat) Do you have any other questions for me, counselor? \nThe courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door. \nKAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting for him to do something... \n", "test3_id": 2987}

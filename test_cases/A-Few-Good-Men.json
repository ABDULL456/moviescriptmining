{"train": "A FEW GOOD MEN \nWritten by \nAaron Sorkin \nRevised Third Draft \nJuly 15, 1991 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A SENTRY TOWER -- \n-- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. \nSmall beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT POST, maybe forty feet off the ground. \nStanding the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding a rifle and staring straight out. \nThe drum cadence has been building slightly. \nCUT TO: \nA WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into the distance. \nSUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA. \nThe drum cadence continues, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. A MARINE BARRACKS \nWe HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then \nCUT TO: \nTHE BARRACKS CORRIDOR \nwhere we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into \nINT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT \nWILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in his bunk. \nDAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong -- \n-- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth. \nEverything that happens next occurs with speed, precision and professionalism. \n-- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto his mouth and eyes -- \n-- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet. \nDOWNEY (quietly) You're lucky it's us, Willy. \n-- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking him, just holding his head still -- \n-- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four sharp blasts from a whistle and we \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY \nand the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished silver and brass. \nThe BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS. \nAs the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works. \nSUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C. \nCUT TO: \nHIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY \nIt's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS enter and exit and \nCUT TO: \nA WOMAN \nas she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building. The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ... \nJO I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, I'd like to request that I be the attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like to request that it be myself who is assigned to represent -- (she stops) \"That it be myself who is assigned to represent\"? ...Good, Jo, that's confidence inspiring. \nWe follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick building which bears the seal of the \nUNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS \nCUT TO: \nINT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY \nAs JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table. \nGIBBS Jo, come on in. \nJO Thank you, sir. \nSHERBY (calling back) I don't think so, Danny. \nKAFFEE (back to SPRADLING) Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore. (back to the field) Let's go, let's get two! \nHe goes back to hitting fungoes. \nSPRADLING I'm gonna charge him with possession and being under the influence while on duty. Plead guilty and I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay. \nKAFFEE It was oregano, Dave, it was ten dollars worth of oregano. \nSPRADLING Yeah, well your client thought it was marijuana. \nKAFFEE My client's a moron, that's not against the law. \nSwapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Ow. That had to hurt. (calling out) Way to keep your head in the play, Lester. Walk it off! \nSPRADLING I've got people to answer to just like you, I'm gonna charge him. \nKAFFEE With what, possession of a condiment? \nSPRADLING Kaffee -- \nKAFFEE Dave, I've tried to help you out of this, but if you ask for tall time, I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss. \nSPRADLING You won't got it. \nKAFFEE I will get it. And if the MTD is denied, I'll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that I'm gonna file against pre-trial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano. \nSPRADLING B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig. \nKAFFEE C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty. \nSPRADLING I don't know why I'm agreeing to this. \nKAFFEE 'Cause you have wisdom beyond your years. Dave, can you play third base? \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nAbout 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) are taking their seats around a large conference table. \nA PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers to the LAWYERS. \nWe might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval officer. \nCAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in. \nWHITAKER 'Morning. \nLAWYERS (school class) 'Morning Captain Whitaker. \nWHITAKER Sam, how's the baby? \nSAM I think she's ready to say her first word any day now. \nWHITAKER How can you tell? \nSAM She just looks like she has something to say. \nKAFFEE walks in. \nKAFFEE Excuse me, sorry I'm late. \nWHITAKER I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, so I won't force you to come up with a bad one. \nKAFFEE Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of you. \nWHITAKER Sit-down, this first one's for you. \nHe hands KAFFEE some files. \nWHITAKER (continuing) You're moving up in the world, Danny, you've been requested by Division. \n\"Oooh\"'s and \"Ahhh\"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.) \nKAFFEE Requested to do what? \nWHITAKER hands him a file. \nWHITAKER Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline and into Cuban territory. \nKAFFEE What's a fenceline? \nWHITAKER Sam? \nSAM A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys. \nKAFFEE Teachers pet. \nWHITAKER PFC William Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson to the Naval investigative Service. Dawson and another member of his squad, PFC Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's room, tie him up, and stuff a rag down his throat. An hour later, Santiago's dead. Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin. \nKAFFEE They poisoned the rag? \nWHITAKER Not according to them. \nKAFFEE What do they say? \nWHITAKER Not much. They're being flown up here tomorrow and on Thursday at 0600 you'll catch a transport down to Cuba for the day to find out what you can. Meantime, go across the yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. She's the one who had 'em brought up here. She'll fill you in on whatever she has. Any questions? \nKAFFEE The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the morning, sir? \nWHITAKER It seems important to Division that this one be handled by the book, so I'm assigning co-counsel. Any volunteers? \nSAM No. \nJO This last letter to the Naval investigative Service -- \nShe hands it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam -- \nJO (continuing) -- where he offers information about Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last ditch effort. \nKAFFEE Right. Is that all? \nJO (beat) Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago. \nKAFFEE Gotcha. (beat) And Santiago is... who? \nJO (beat) The victim. \nKAFFEE (to SAM) Write that down. (to JO) Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay? \nJO Yes, among other -- \nKAFFEE And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy. \nJO Colonel Jessep, yes, but -- \nKAFFEE Twelve years. \nJO I'm sorry? \nKAFFEE Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years. \nJO You haven't talked to a witness, you haven't looked at a piece of paper. \nKAFFEE Pretty impressive, huh? \nJO You're gonna have to go deeper than just -- \nKAFFEE Commander, do you have some sort of jurisdiction here that I should know about? \nJO My job is to make sure you do your job. I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty much in your face. Read the letters. You're not under any obligation, but I'd appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba. \nKAFFEE Sure. \nKAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say -- \nJO You're dismissed. \nKAFFEE Sorry, I always forget that. \nKAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway. \nSAM He's a little preoccupied. (beat) The team's playing Bethesda Medical next week. \nJO Tell your friend not to get cute down there.  The marines in Guantanimo are fanatical. \nSAM About what? \nAnd in VOICE OVER we HEAR -- \nSANTIAGO (V.O.) Dear Sir, \nJO About being marines. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CUBAN FIELD - DAY \nSERIES OF SHOTS - DAY \nAnd while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 months. He had a rough time of it. \nTHE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE: \n-- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES. It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get back up and keep running, and \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY \n-- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain. He's being supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits the mud every time down and \nCUT TO: \nINT. MESS HALL - DAY \n-- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend within four seats of him and \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARINE BARRACKS - DAY \n-- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his squad and \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY \n-- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like he's gonna pass out. \nHe stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over this, we HEAR \nSANTIAGO (V.O.) \"...My name is PFC William T. Santiago. I am a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Delta. I am writing to inform you of my problems with my unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I've fallen out on runs before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps.\" \nAt this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we \nCUT TO: \nINT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY \nLOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do. \nDAWSON's his hero. \nThe two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as we'll be in Oz. \nDOWNEY Hal? \nDAWSON doesn't say anything. \nDOWNEY (continuing) Is this Washington, D.C.? \nM.P. Alright, let's move. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY \nand KAFFEE's at it again. \nKAFFEE Alright, let's get tough out there! \nJO walks up from behind the backstop. \nJO Excuse me. \nKAFFEE You want to suit up? We need all the help we can get. \nJO No, thank you, I can't throw and catch things. \nKAFFEE That's okay, neither can they. \nJO I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson and Private Downey. \nKAFFEE Say again? \nJO Dawson and Downey. \nKAFFEE (beat) Those names sound like they should mean something to me, but I'm just not -- \nJO Dawson! Downey! Your clients! \nKAFFEE The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey. (beat) Right. (pause) I've done something wrong again, haven't I? \nJO I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball. \nKAFFEE We need the practice. \nJO That wasn't funny. \nKAFFEE It was a little funny. \nJO Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel? \nKAFFEE Why? \nJO I don't think you're fit to handle this defense. \nKAFFEE You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover I'm not fit to handle a defense. \nJo just stares. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Oh come on, that was damn funny. \nJo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of confidentiality. \nJO I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance. \nKAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech. \nKAFFEE Wow. (beat) I'm sexually aroused, Commander. \nJO I don't think your clients murdered anybody. \nKAFFEE What are you basing this on? \nJO There was no intent. \nKAFFEE The doctor's report says that Santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. (beat) Now, I don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad. \nJO Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison. \nKAFFEE Oh, now I see what you're saying. It had to be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick. \nJO I'm gonna speak to your supervisor. \nKAFFEE Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's a big white house with pillars in front. \nJO Thank you. \nKAFFEE I don't think you'll have much luck, though. I was assigned by Division, remember? Somebody over there thinks I'm a good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself. \nJO Do you know what a code red is? \nKAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything. \nJO (continuing) What a pity. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BRIG - DAY \nAnd an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and DOWNEY's cell. \nM.P. Officer on deck, ten-hut. \nDAWSON No sir. \nKAFFEE What was your intent? \nDAWSON To train him, sir. \nKAFFEE Train him to do what? \nDAWSON Train him to think of his unit before himself. To respect the code. \nSAM What's the code? \nDAWSON Unit Corps God Country. \nSAM I beg your pardon? \nDAWSON Unit Corps God Country, sir. \nKAFFEE The Goverrment of the United States wants to charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with unit, corps, god, country? \nDAWSON stares at KAFFEE. \nDAWSON That's our code, sir. \nKAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he and SAM move to the door. \nKAFFEE We'll be back. You guys need anything? Books paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich? \nDAWSON Sir. No thank you. Sir. \nKAFFEE smiles at DAWSON. \nKAFFEE Harold, I think there's a concept you better start warming up to. \nDAWSON Sir? \nKAFFEE I'm the only friend you've got. \nAnd as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute. \nThey hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of sight, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in.. \nROSS Dan Kaffee. \nKAFFEE Sailin' Jack Ross. \nROSS Welcome to the big time. \nKAFFEE You think so? \nROSS I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake you practice law better than you play softball. \nKAFFEE Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don't do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin' at? \nROSS They plead guilty to manslaughter, I'll drop the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll be home in half that time. \nKAFFEE I want twelve. \nROSS Can't do it. \nKAFFEE They called the ambulance, Jack. \nROSS I don't care if they called the Avon Lady, they killed a marine. \nKAFFEE The rag was tested for poison.  The autopsy, lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the same thing: Maybe, maybe not. \nROSS The Chief of Internal Medicine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he's sure. \nKAFFEE What do you know about Code Reds? \nROSS smiles and shakes his head. \nROSS Oh man. \nHe closes the office door. \nROSS (continuing) Are we off the record? \nKAFFEE You tell me. \nROSS (pause) I'm gonna give you the twelve years, but before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know this: The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago. \nKAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats. \nKAFFEE I'll talk to you when I get back. \nROSS Hey, we got a little four-on-four going tomorrow night. When does your plane get in? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  THE PARKING LOT - DUSK \nIt's dusk and people on the base are going home from work. We can see the flag being lowered in the background. \nKAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts walking along with him. \nJO Hi there. \nKAFFEE Any luck getting me replaced? \nKAFFEE It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight. \nSAM (beat) Danny, take the twelve years, it's a gift. \nKAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands. \nKAFFEE You don't believe their story, do you? You think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. \nSAM I believe every word they said. And I think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives. \nKAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle. \nKAFFEE I'll see you tomorrow. \nSam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the stoop for a moment. \nSAM Remember to wear your whites, it's hot down there. \nKAFFEE I don't like the whites. \nSAM Nobody likes the whites, but we're going to Cuba in August. You got Dramamine? \nKAFFEE Dramamine keeps you cool? \nSAM Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get sick when you fly. \nKAFFEE I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid of crashing into a large mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll help. \nSAM I've got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good. \nKAFFEE Yeah, right. \nKAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around. \nKAFFEE (continuing) You know, Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them not to touch Santiago. \nSAM So? \nKAFFEE I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't even know who he is. (beat) What the hell. (beat) I'll see you tomorrow. \nWe hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY \nThe whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity. \nA 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a stair unit is brought up. \nHOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis. \nKAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in Kansas anymore. \nHOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes. \nHOWARD Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg? \nKAFFEE (shouting) Yeah. \nJO Commander Galloway. \nHOWARD I'm Corporal Howard, ma'am, I'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base. \nJO Thank you. \nHOWARD I've got some camouflage jackets in the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll have to ask you both to put them on. \nKAFFEE Camouflage jackets? \nHOWARD Regulations, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline. The Cubans see an officer wearing white, they think it's someone they might wanna take a shot at. \nKAFFEE turns and glares at SAM. \nKAFFEE Good call, Sam. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY \nTearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of Guantanamo Bay. \nHOWARD (shouting) We'll just hop on the ferry and be over there in no time. \nKAFFEE (shouting) Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?! \nHOWARD Yes sir, to get to the other side of the bay. \nKAFFEE Nobody said anything about a boat. \nHOWARD (shouting) Is there a problem, sir? \nKAFFEE (shouting) No. No problem. I'm just not that crazy about boats, that's all. \nJO (shouting) Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy for cryin' out loud! \nKAFFEE (shouting) Nobody likes her very much. \nHOWARD (shouting) Yes sir. \nThe jeep drives on and we \nCUT TO: \nJESSEP, MARKINSON and KENDRICK are standing as the LAWYERS are led in. \nSAM and KENDRICK walk out the door. JO stops KAFFEE. \nJO You planning on doing any investigating or are you just gonna take the guided tour? \nKAFFEE (beat) I'm pacing myself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - DAY \nJESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a table in the corner. \nStewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is finishing a story. \nJESSEP ...And they spent the next three hours running around, looking for Americans to surrender to. \nJESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a laugh. \nMARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent. \nJESSEP (continuing; to the STEWARDS) That was delicious, men, thank you. \nSTEWARD Our pleasure, sir. \nKAFFEE Colonel just need to ask you a couple of questions about August 6th. \nJESSEP Shoot. \nKAFFEE On the morning of the sixth, you were contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to an illegal fenceline shooting. \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE Santiago was gonna reveal the person's name in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, you should free to speak up. \nJESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak freely on his own base. \nJESSEP Thank you. \nKAFFEE Now it was at this point that you called Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE And what happened then? \nJESSEP We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred off the base. \nHere's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. SAM jots something down on a small notepad. \nMARKINSON doesn't flinch. \nKAFFEE Santiago was set to be transferred? \nJESSEP On the first available flight to the states. Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out. \nKAFFEE nods. \nKAFFEE Yeah. \nThere's silence for a moment. \nKAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and puts it down. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Alright, that's all I have. Thanks very much for your time. \nKENDRICK The corporal's got the jeep outside, he'll take you back to the airstrip. \nKAFFEE (standing) Thank you. \nJO Wait a minute, I've got some questions. \nKAFFEE No you don't. \nJO Yes I do. \nKAFFEE No you don't. \nJO Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five? \nKAFFEE Jo -- \nJESSEP Of course I met with the doctor. One of my men was dead. \nKAFFEE (to JO) See? The man was dead. Let's go. \nJO (to JESSEP) I was wondering if you've ever heard the term Code Red. \nKAFFEE Jo -- \nJESSEP I've heard the term, yes. \nJO Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers. \nJESSEP I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo? \nKAFFEE She has no point. She often has no point. It's part of her charm. We're outta here. Thank you. \nJO My point is that I think code reds still go on down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel? \nKAFFEE Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer that. \nJO Yes he does. \nJO I already tried, I can't find him. \nKAFFEE You tried? Joanne, you're coming dangerously close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government investigation. \nJO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding. \nJO I'm Louden Downey's attorney. \nKAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read. \nJO (continuing) Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she's known me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago. \nKAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then finally... \nKAFFEE I suppose it's way too much to hope that you're just making this up to bother me. \nJO Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a motion for separation, you're still lead counsel. \nKAFFEE hands her back the file. \nKAFFEE Splendid. \nJO I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. (beat) So do you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A HOLDING ROOM IN THE BRIG - NIGHT \nDAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention as KAFFEE and JO are led in. \nDAWSON Officer on deck, ten hut. \nKAFFEE starts in immediately. \nKAFFEE Did Kendrick order the code red? \nDAWSON Sir? \nKAFFEE Don't say sir like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you guys to give Santiago a code red? \nDAWSON Yes sir. \nKAFFEE (to Downey) Did he? \nDOWNEY Yes sir. \nKAFFEE You mind telling me why the hell you never mentioned this before? \nDAWSON You didn't ask us, sir. \nKAFFEE Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a place in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail. \nDAWSON Yes sir. I know you do, sir. \nKAFFEE Fuck you, Harold. \nThere's some understandable tension in the room, broken by -- \nJO Alright. Let's sort this out. There was a platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt. Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to Santiago. Now is that true? I want you to speak freely. \nDAWSON Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon and we all went to our rooms. \nJO And what happened then? \nDAWSON Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am. \nKAFFEE When? \nDAWSON About five minutes after the meeting broke, sir. About 16:20. \nKAFFEE (continuing) And what happened then? \nDAWSON Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT \nROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some other OFFICERS. \nA door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross. \nKAFFEE shouts -- \nKAFFEE Jack! \nBut ROSS is into the game... \nKAFFEE (continuing) Jack!! \nROSS (waving him off) Hang on... \nKAFFEE They were given an order. \nROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the gym and the three of them make their way to privacy. \nJO How long have you known about the order? \nROSS I didn't -- (to KAFFEE) Who is this? \nKAFFEE This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you. \nROSS What exactly are you accusing me of, commander? \nJO I'm accusing you of -- \nKAFFEE Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute. \nJo waits Just a moment before she calls out -- \nJO (to Downey) Let's go in another room. Louden, everything's gonna be alright. \nThe M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door. \nJO (continuing; to M.P.) We're gonna go into a holding room. \nM.P. Aye, aye, ma'am. \nJO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment before he says -- \nKAFFEE You don't like me that much, do you? (beat) Forget it, don't answer that, it doesn't matter. \nKAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying to choose his tack carefully. \nKAFFEE (continuing) You know, Downey worships you. He's gonna do whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code? Harold? \nDAWSON Do you think we were right? \nKAFFEE It doesn't matter what I -- \nDAWSON Do you think we were right? \nKAFFEE gets up. \nKAFFEE (beat) I think you'd lose. \nDAWSON (beat) You're such a coward, I can't believe they let you wear a uniform. \nKAFFEE stares at DAWSON. \nKAFFEE I'm not gonna feel responsible for this, Harold. I did everything I could. You're going to Levenworth for the better part of your life, and you know what? I don't give a shit. \nKAFFEE calls out -- \nKAFFEE (continuing) M.P.! \nKAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave. \nKAFFEE (continuing) What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room? \nDAWSON holds on KAFFEE. Then DAWSON, a man who would rather die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts them in his pockets. \nThe cell door closes and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OFFICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nOne light is on at the end of the hall. \nCUT TO: \nSAM has joined KAFFEE and JO. The mood is somber. \nKAFFEE Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business. I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way down. (to SAM) I want to get him a new lawyer. How do I do it? \nSAM You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the arraignment. The judge'll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell him you want new counsel assigned. \nKAFFEE (beat) Then that's that. \nJO (beat) Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely. \nKAFFEE What do you want from me? \nJO I want you to let 'em be judged! I want you to stand up and make an argument! \nSAM An argument that didn't work for Calley at My Lai, an argument that didn't work for the Nazis at Nuremberg. \nKAFFEE For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think that's the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that they never believed would result in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis. \nThere's a pause in the room. \nJO Don't look now, Danny, but you're making an argument. \nKAFFEE (pause) Yeah. (beat) Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new attorney. \nJO Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? Were daddy's expectations really that high? \nKAFFEE Please, spare me the psycho-babble father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll have their day in court, but they'll have it with another lawyer. \nJO Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win. (beat) You know they have a case. And you know how to win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate. \nKAFFEE Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died. \nJO Do you believe they have a defense? \nKAFFEE You and Dawson both live in the same dreamland. It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove. So please don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law. \nJO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away. She turns back. \nJO You know nothing about the law. You're a used car salesman, Daniel. You're an ambulance chaser with a rank. You're nothing. (beat) Live with that. \nJo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's not having a good night. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT \nKAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high stakes corporate law. \nWe HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then \nRANDOLPH enters. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS All rise. \nROSS Too late. \nKAFFEE walks back to his table as \nSERGEANT AT ARMS All those having business with this general court-martial, stand forward and you shall be heard. Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding. God save the United States of America. \nRANDOLPH raps the gavel. \nRANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record. \nROSS No objection, your honor. \nKAFFEE No objection. \nRANDOLPH Is the Government prepared to make an opening statement? \nROSS (standing) Yes sir. \nROSS walks to the jury box. \nROSS (continuing) The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill. (beat) Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case. (beat) And they are undisputed. \nROSS walks back to his seat. \nRANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee? \nBefore KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of his mouth. \nKAFFEE There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true. (beat) When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do. (beat) Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags. (beat) Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job. \nKAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat. \nRANDOLPH Is the Government ready to call its first witness? \nROSS Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C McGuire. \nWhile McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn in, KAFFEE has sat back down. \nHe leans over to DAWSON and whispers. \nKAFFEE How you doin'? \nDAWSON doesn't change his expression. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Good. \nROSS Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please? \nMCGUIRE Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval Investigative Service. \nROSS Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year? \nMCGUIRE We did. \nROSS What did the letter say? \nMCGUIRE That a member of Private Santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline. \nROSS Was that marine identified in the letter? \nMCGUIRE No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming down to investigate. \nROSS And what did you find? \nMCGUIRE For the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing. \nROSS And who was that? \nMCGUIRE Lance Corporal Harold Dawson. \nROSS (continuing; to KAFFEE) Your witness. \nROSS goes back to his table. KAFFEE stands. \nKAFFEE Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal Dawson about the fenceline shooting? \nMCGUIRE Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy. \nKAFFEE But you don't believe him. \nMCGUIRE It's not my place -- \nKAFFEE Corporal Dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause? \nMCGUIRE There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. \nKAFFEE Thank you. \nKAFFEE sits. \nROSS Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. You had Willy Santiago's letter. \nMCGUIRE Santiago was the only witness, but I never had a chance to interview him. So I don't know what he saw. \nROSS And now we won't ever know, will we, Mr. McGuire? \nMCGUIRE No. \nROSS No more questions. \nCUT TO: \nKAFFEE sits. \nROSS Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning? \nSTONE Absolutely. \nROSS Are you aware that the lab report and the coroners report showed no traces of poison? \nSTONE Yes I am. \nROSS Then how do you justify -- \nSTONE There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable, both in the human body and on a fabric. The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue. \nROSS Thank you, sir. \nKAFFEE gets up. \nKAFFEE Commander, you testified that it takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal. \nSTONE Yes. \nKAFFEE Let me ask you, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis dramatically? \nSTONE says nothing for a moment. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Commander, is it possible? \nSTONE Certainly. \nKAFFEE What might some of those conditions be? \nSTONE (beat) If a person had a coronary disorder... or a cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid. \nKAFFEE Commander, if I had a coronary condition, and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out? \nSTONE It would have to be a very serious condition. \nKAFFEE Is it possible to have a serious coronary condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam? \nSTONE Possibly. There would still be symptoms though. \nKAFFEE What kind of symptoms? \nSTONE There are hundreds of symptoms of a -- \nKAFFEE Chest pains? \nSTONE (beat) Yes. \nKAFFEE Shortness of breath? \nSTONE Yes. \nKAFFEE Fatigue? \nSTONE Of course. \nKAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed him some documents. He shows then to STONE. \nKAFFEE Doctor, is this your signature? \nSTONE Yes it is. \nKAFFEE This in an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the bottom of the page, please, sir. \nSTONE (reading) \"Initial testing negative. Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week.\" \nKAFFEE Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical reaction? \nSTONE No. I personally give the men a physical examination every three months. And every three months Private Santiago got a clean bill of health. \nKAFFEE And that's why it had to be, poison, right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died from a heart related incident, you'd have a lot to answer for, wouldn't you, doctor? \nROSS Object. Move to strike. \nRANDOLPH Sustained. Strike it. \nKAFFEE No more questions, judge. \nROSS stands immediately. \nROSS Dr. Stone, you've held a license to practice medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000 men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned? \nJo stands. \nJO Your Honor, we re-new our objection to Commander Stone's testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this witness's testimony. \nKAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this, but he thought he made himself clear. \nRANDOLPH The objection's overruled, counsel. \nJO Sir, the defense strenuously objects and requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection. \nRANDOLPH The objection of the defense has been heard and overruled. \nJO Exception. \nRANDOLPH Noted. The witness is an expert and the court will hear his opinion. \nROSS Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned? \nSTONE Yes. \nROSS Thank you, sir, I have no more questions. \nJO Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation. \nKAFFEE Why are you always giving me your resume? \nJO Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer. \nKAFFEE I do. \nJO No you don't. (beat) I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you. \nKAFFEE (pause) Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. (beat) Ross's opening speech, it was all true. (beat) I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. (beat) We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder. \nJO We'll find Markinson. \nKAFFEE Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge. \nWe HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear \nHOWARD (V.O.) Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nCUT TO: \nCORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around Cuba, is on the stand. \nKAFFEE Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red? \nHOWARD Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run... \nKAFFEE Have you ever received a code red? \nHOWARD Yes sir. We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped. It's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and I'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught. \nKAFFEE And what happened? \nHOWARD That night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes. Then they poured glue on my hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I ain't never dropped my weapon since. \nKAFFEE Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Was his barracks ever in disorder? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Did he ever fall back on a run? \nHOWARD All the time, sir. \nKAFFEE Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red? \nHOWARD No sir. \nKAFFEE (beat) Never? \nHOWARD No, sir. \nKAFFEE You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one? \nHOWARD Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir. \nKAFFEE Dawson wouldn't allow it. \nHOWARD The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him. They were too afraid of Dawson, sir. \nROSS Object. The witness is characterizing. \nKAFFEE I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nKAFFEE Why didn't you? \nHOWARD 'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir. \nKAFFEE Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now. \nROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on the table. He brings one to HOWARD. \nROSS Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nROSS Have you read it? \nHOWARD Yes sir. \nROSS Good. (hands him the book) Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please. \nHOWARD Sir? \nROSS Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds. \nHOWARD Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use -- it's just used down at GITMO, sir. I don't know if it actually -- \nROSS has produced another book. \nROSS We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct? \nHOWARD No sir. \nROSS No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds? \nHOWARD (pause) No sir. No books, sir. \nROSS No further questions. \nMARKINSON (V.O.) United states marine corps. \nWe HEAR the BLAST of the gunshot as we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE COURTROOM - DAY \nKaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey. \nKAFFEE Private, I want you to tell us one last time: Why did you go into Private Santiago's room on the night of August 6th? \nDOWNEY A code red was ordered by my platoon commander, Lt. Jonathan James Kendrick. \nKAFFEE Thank you. (to ROSS) Your witness. \nROSS Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch log has you down at Post 39, is that correct? \nDOWNEY I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that log pretty good. \nROSS How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward barracks? \nDOWNEY It's a ways, sir, it's a hike. \nROSS About how far by jeep? \nDOWNEY About ten, fifteen minutes, sir. \nROSS Have you ever had to walk it? \nDOWNEY Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what we call the fella who drops us at our posts and picks us up... also, 'cause he can get girls in New York City -- the Pick-up Private got a flat... \nAt the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at it: \n\"Where's he going with this?\" JO scribbles \"?\" And hands it back to KAFFEE. \nDOWNEY (continuing) ...Right at 39. He pulled up and blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. The two of us had to double-time it back to the barracks. \nROSS And if it's ten or fifteen minutes by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right? \nDOWNEY Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, sir. \nROSS Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your barracks room at 16:20. \nKAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury. \nDOWNEY Yes sir. \nJO. Helpless. Panicked. \nROSS But you just said that you didn't make it back to Windward Barracks until 16:45. \nDOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked before. \nDOWNEY Sir? \nROSS If you didn't make it back to your barracks until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20? \nDOWNEY (pause) You see sir, there was a flat tire. \nROSS Private, did you ever actually hear Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red? \nKAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing he can do about it. And he knows it. \nDOWNEY (pause) No, sir. \nJo leaps to her feet. \nJO Please the court, I'd like to request a recess in order to confer with my client. \nROSS Why did you go into Santiago's room? \nJO The witness has rights. \nROSS The witness has been read his rights, commander. \nDOWNEY (confused) Hal? \nRANDOLPH The question will be repeated. \nROSS Why did you go into Santiago's room? \nJO Your honor -- \nDOWNEY Hal? \nROSS Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it? \nEveryone is frozen. \nROSS (continuing) He did, didn't he? Dawson told you to give Santiago a code red. \nDOWNEY looks at DAWSON. \nDOWNEY Hal? \nROSS Don't look at him. \nDOWNEY Hal? \nDAWSON Private. Answer the Lieutenant's question. \nThe room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right thing. \nDOWNEY Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order by my squad leader, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine Corps. And I followed it. \nThere's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing after this exhausting outburst. \nFinally... \nJO I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives. \nJo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams behind her. \nKAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word. \nSAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk. \nKAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels. \nKAFFEE Stop cleaning up. \nBut Sam continues. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Sam. Stop cleaning up. \nSAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch. \nKAFFEE (continuing) You want a drink? \nSAM Yeah. \nSAM takes a swig from the bottle. \nKAFFEE Is your father proud of you? \nSAM Don't do this to yourself. \nKAFFEE I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. \"Sam, made Law Review. He's got a big case he's making -- He's arguing making an argument.\" (pause) I think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. (beat) I think he would've liked that... an awful lot. \nSAM Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on your father in college? \nKAFFEE Yeah? \nSAM He was one of the best trial lawyers ever. \nKAFFEE Yes he was. \nSAM And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I'd take you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick. \nKAFFEE Would you put Jessep on the stand? \nSAM No. \nKAFFEE You think my father would've? \nSAM With the evidence we've got? Not in a million years. But here's the thing -- and there's really no way of getting around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So there's only one question. What would you do? \nWe HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT \nJO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing her best not to fall apart. \nTWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window. \nKAFFEE Joanne. \nJO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with her. \nJO starts walking faster. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Jo, we look ridiculous. (to SAM) Stop the car. \nKAFFEE hops out and calls -- \nKAFFEE (continuing) Joanne. \nJO keeps walking. \nKAFFEE (continuing) I apologize. I was angry and... I'm sorry about what I said. \nBut JO'S still walking. \nKAFFEE (continuing; calling) I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand. \nShe stops. She turns around. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON \nA nerf ball bounces off the wall. \nKAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea. KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game. \nJO I say we hit him with the phoney transfer order. \nSAM What's the transfer order without a witness? \nKAFFEE We have a witness. \nSAM A dead witness. \nKAFFEE And in the hands of a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem. \nSAM Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound. \nKAFFEE I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of you. \nJO How're you feeling? \nKAFFEE I think he's gonna have his hands full today. \nJO Listen. (beat) Danny. (beat) When you're out there. If it's not gonna happen he's not gonna say it (beat) ...don't go for it. \nKAFFEE looks at her. \nJO (continuing) If you feel like... if you feel like... You could get in trouble. (beat) I'm special counsel for internal affairs, and I'm telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble. \nKAFFEE Why Lt. Commander Galloway... are you suggesting I back off a material witness? \nJO If you think you can't get him. (beat) Yeah. \nKAFFEE Do you think I can get him? \nJO (beat) I think it doesn't matter what I think. I'm an administrator. (beat) I can't seem to defend people. \nKAFFEE takes that in. He picks up his briefcase and grabs his jacket. \nThen he turns to JO. \nKAFFEE You're my hero, Joanne. (beat) From the first day, you were a lawyer. (beat) Live with that. \nAnd in VOICE OVER we HEAR the SERGEANT AT ARMS. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS (V.O.) All rise. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE COURTROOM - DAY \nEveryone stands at attention as RANDOLPH enters. SAM is missing. \nRANDOLPH (to KAFFEE) Call your witness. \nKAFFEE Where's Sam? \nJO He'll be here. \nRANDOLPH Lieutenant, call your witness. \nKAFFEE Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep. \nJESSEP is escorted in through a side door. He's wearing his dress uniforms, adorned with the appropriate medals. \nROSS Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give in this General Court-Martial will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? \nJESSEP Yes I do. \nROSS Would you state your name, rank, and current billet for the record please, air? \nJESSEP Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \nROSS Thank you, sir, would you have a seat, please. \nJESSEP sits. \nKAFFEE Colonel, when you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson. \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE And at present, Captain Markinson is dead, is that right? \nROSS Objection. I'd like to know just what defense counsel is implying? \nKAFFEE I'm implying simply that, at present, Captain Markinson is not alive. \nROSS Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to appear in this courtroom to confirm that information. \nKAFFEE I just wasn't sure if the witness was aware that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45 caliber pistol. \nAnd from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the defense table. \nOver this we HEAR -- \nRANDOLPH (O.S.) The witness is aware, the Court is aware, and now the jury is aware. We thank you for bringing this to our attention. Move on Lieutenant. \nSAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH. \nKAFFEE Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right? \nJESSEP I told Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched. \nKAFFEE And did you give an order to Captain Markinson as well? \nJESSEP I ordered Markinson to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately. \nKAFFEE Why? \nJESSEP I felt that his life might be in danger once word of the letter got out. \nKAFFEE Grave danger? \nJESSEP Is there another kind? \nKAFFEE holds up a document from his table. \nKAFFEE We have the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight off the bass? \nJESSEP The six a.m. flight was the first flight off the base. \nRANDOLPH Lt. Kaffee? \nKAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and PEREZ. \nRANDOLPH (continuing) Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness? \nKAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave. \nJESSEP (standing) Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. \nAnd JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by -- \nKAFFEE Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you. \nJESSEP turns around. \nJESSEP I beg your pardon. \nKAFFEE I'm not through with my examination. Sit down. \nJESSEP Colonel. \nKAFFEE What's that? \nJESSEP (to RANDOLPH) I'd appreciate it if he addressed me as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've earned it. \nRANDOLPH Defense counsel will address the witness as Colonel or Sir. \nJESSEP (to RANDOLPH) I don't know what the hell kind of an outfit you're running here. \nRANDOLPH And the witness will address this Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm quite certain I've earned it. Take your seat, Colonel. \nJessep goes back to the stand. \nJESSEP (continuing) What would you like to discuss now! My favorite color? \nKAFFEE Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first one off the base? \nJESSEP Yes. \nKAFFEE There wasn't a flight that left seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m.? \nRANDOLPH Lieutenant, I think we've covered this, haven't we? \nKAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the piece of paper that SAM scribbled on. \nKAFFEE Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no flight that landed at 2 a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\". \nRANDOLPH I don't understand. You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed? \nKAFFEE We believe it did, sir. (glancing at the paper, then motioning to the AIRMEN) Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh. \nROSS Your Honor, these men weren't on the list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony offered under direct examination. \nIf you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of sweat. \nRANDOLPH I'll allow the witnesses. \nJESSEP This is ridiculous. \nKAFFEE Colonel, a moment ago -- \nJESSEP Check the Tower Logs for christ's sake. \nKAFFEE We'll get to the airmen in just a minute, sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to touch Santiago. \nJESSEP That's right. \nKAFFEE And Kendrick was clear on what you wanted? \nJESSEP Crystal. \nKAFFEE Any chance Kendrick ignored the order? \nJESSEP Ignored the order? \nKAFFEE Any chance he just forgot about it? \nJESSEP No. \nKAFFEE Any chance Kendrick left your office and said, \"The 'old man's wrong\"? \nJESSEP No. \nKAFFEE When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him? \nJESSEP Have you ever spent time in an infantry unit, son? \nKAFFEE No sir. \nJESSEP Ever served in a forward area? \nKAFFEE No sir. \nJESSEP Ever put your life in another man's hands, ask him to put his life in yours? \nKAFFEE No sir. \nJESSEP We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear? \nKAFFEE Yes sir. \nJESSEP Are we clear? \nKAFFEE Crystal. \nKAFFEE (as a friend) Jack. \nROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head \"yes\" to RANDOLPH. \nRANDOLPH The Sergeant at Arms will take the jury to an ante-room where you'll wait until further instruction. \nThe SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the room. \nJESSEP What the hell's going on? \nNo one will say anything until the jurors are out of the room. \nJESSEP (continuing; to captain) Captain, what the hell's going on? I did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm getting on a plane and going back to my base. \nRANDOLPH M.P.'s, guard the prisoner. \nThe M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel referred to as \"the prisoner\" before. They sure as hell have never been asked to guard one. \nROSS Guard the prisoner. \nJESSEP What the hell -- \nROSS Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent. Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding. You have the right... \nROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over -- \nJESSEP I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what this is -- (to Ross) Marine! (Ross keeps going) Marine!! (Ross is doing his job.) I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- that's what's happening? This -- I'm -- this is funny, you know that, this is -- \nAnd JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP. SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE. \nJESSEP (continuing; to Kaffee) I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine. \nROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights. \nROSS Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights as I have just read then to you? \nJESSEP I saved lives. That boy was -- there was a weak link. I saved lives, you hear me? \nThe courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes his head. \nJESSEP (continuing) You fuckin' people. (beat) You have no idea how to defend a nation. (continuing; to KAFFEE) All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That's all you did. You put people in danger. Sweet dreams, son. \nKAFFEE Don't call me son. (beat) I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the United States Navy. And you're under arrest you sonofabitch. \nKAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers -- \nKAFFEE (continuing) The witness is excused. \nThe M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nThere's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led back into their box. \nEveryone's in place. \nRANDOLPH enters. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS Ten-hut. \nAll rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits. \nRANDOLPH Have the jurors reached a verdict? \nJURY FOREMAN We have, sir. \nThe SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH. \nKAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should do the same. SAM and JO stand as well. \nRANDOLPH (reading) On the charge of Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty. \nIt's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but they do. \nRANDOLPH (continuing; reading) On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty. \nRANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper. \nRANDOLPH (continuing) On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming a United States Marine, the members find the defendants Guilty as Charged. \nA little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH continues reading. \nRANDOLPH (continuing; reading) The defendants are hereby sentenced by this court to time already served, and are ordered... \nRANDOLPH clears his throat. \nRANDOLPH (continuing) ...And are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the marine corps. (pause) This Court-Martial is adjourned. \nRANDOLPH raps his gavel. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS Ten hut. \nAll rise. \nRANDOLPH's gone. \nSERGEANT AT ARMS (continuing) Dismissed. \nThe M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day at the office. \nDAWSON Why? \nKAFFEE Harold, I'm sorry. \n", "test1_input": "KAFFEE (continuing; pause) I need you. You're better at research than I am and you know how to prepare a witness. \nJo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other. But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer. \nJO I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first. \nKAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head. \nSAM Did you get any dumplings? \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT \nThe remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers to the blackboard. \nKAFFEE This is our defense. Intent: No one can prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red: They're common and accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order: (he writes) A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no choice but to follow it. (beat) That's it. \nSAM What about motive? \nKAFFEE We're a little weak on motive. They had one. \nJO Just because a person has a motive doesn't mean -- \nKAFFEE Relax. We'll deal with the fenceline shooting when it comes up. For now we start here -- (pointing to INTENT) I don't know what made Santiago die, I don't want to know. I just want to be able to show it could've been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let's start prepping for Stone. \nJO As long as we're on the subject of the doctor -- \nKAFFEE Here we go. \nJO Listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't know what killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock he says it was poison? The doctor's covering up the truth. \nKAFFEE Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use the \"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire\" defense. We can't prove coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information. \nSAM Cartons 3 and 4. \nKAFFEE looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of paper. \nKAFFEE No Cliff-Notes on these things? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - \nSERIES OF SCENES \nThe scenes cover the three weeks of preparation leading up to the trial, and are interspersed with shots of Kaffee's apartment getting messier, KAFFEE, JO and SAM flipping through documents and reference books, writing on the blackboard, dozzing off... \nWe start with \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJo's on the phone, KAFFEE and SAM are going over testimony, with SAM sitting in a mock witness chair. During this, KAFFEE will go to the door, pay the PIZZA Man for the pizza, and return without missing a single beat. \nJO (into phone) Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway, I'm an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. I'm trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC... \nKAFFEE Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there any other sign of external damage? \nSAM No. \nKAFFEE No scrapes? \nSAM No. \nKAFFEE No cuts? \nJO (into phone) He resigned his commission a week ago Thursday. \nKAFFEE Bruises? Broken bones? \nSAM No. \nJO (into phone) No, please don't put me on hold -- \nKAFFEE Doctor, was there any sign of violence? \nSAM (beat) You mean other than the dead body? \nKAFFEE Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam time! \nSAM Don't ask the last question. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT \nMOS -- JO pulls two thick volumes off a shelf and takes them to the table where SAM and KAFFEE are working. She plops the books down where they join a pile of about two-dozen just like them and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. A COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nThe LAWYERS have their books and papers spread out in front of them. \nKAFFEE Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary action, or \"training'' as you say -- \nJO Object. \nKAFFEE Please the Court, I maintain that nothing could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example of, among others, the witness. \nJO Nice. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. THE BRIG - DAY \nA HOLDING ROOM where DAWSON and DOWNEY are being put through their paces. \nJO And what happened after Kendrick came into your room? \nDOWNEY (beat) He ordered me and Corporal Dawson to give Willy a Code Red. \nSAM (to Jo) His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The Iowa farmboy thing'll play for a while, but in the end it looks like he's searching for the truth. \nKAFFEE (to Dawson & Downey) He's right, and from now on, \"Willy\" is Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he's a person who's got a mother who's gonna miss him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMOS -- The clock reads 3:37, and KAFFEE, in sweatpants and a bathrobe, is pacing around slowly with his baseball bat and \nCUT TO: \nSAM and JO art listening to a lecture for the 14th time. \nKAFFEE Poker faces. Don't flinch in front of the jury. Something doesn't go our way, don't hang your head, don't shift in your seat, don't scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look like it's exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me documents -- \nJO/SAM Do it swiftly, but don't look overanxious. \nKAFFEE (beat) And don't wear that perfume in Court, it wrecks my concentration. \nJO Really! \nKAFFEE I was talking to Sam. \nSAM What time is it? \nKAFFEE Time to go home. Try to get some sleep tonight. \nJO (to SAM) I'll give you a ride. \nSAM begins to gather up his things. He stands in front of KAFFEE. \nKAFFEE (to SAM) You're a good man, Charlie Brown. \nSAM See you in court. \nSam steps out the door. JO looks at the ground, then up at KAFFEE. \nJO Danny -- \nKAFFEE I know what you're gonna say. You don't have to. We've had our differences. I've said some things I didn't mean, you've said some things you didn't means but you're happy that I stuck with the case. And if you've gained a certain respect for me over the last three weeks that you didn't have before, well, of course I'm happy about that, but we don't have to make a whole big deal out of it. You like me. I won't make you say it. \nJO I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow. \nKAFFEE (beat) Oh. (beat) Okay. Good tip. \nJO We're ready. \nKAFFEE Bet your ass. \nJo walks out the door and KAFFEE closes it and locks it behind her. \nThen he says, very softly... \nKAFFEE (continuing) We're gonna get creamed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY \nA few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately stricken by something: \nIn his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and walks into \nINT. THE COURTROOM - DAY \nA few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is stopped by a voice behind him. \nMAN (O.S.) Lieutenant Kaffee? \nKAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly Dawson's parents. \nMAN You're gonna save our son, aren't you? \nKAFFEE (pause) I'll do my best. \nKAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with a WOMAN in her mid-30's. \nJO Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt. \nKAFFEE You're Aunt Ginny? \nGINNY Uh-huh. \nKAFFEE I'm sorry, I was expecting someone older. \nGINNY So was I. \nNot quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do. \nHe walks over to ROSS. \nKAFFEE Last chance. I'll flip you for it. \n", "test2_input": "KAFFEE We've got the transfer order. It's got your signature. \nMARKINSON I know. I signed it the morning you arrived in Cuba. Six days after Santiago died. \nKAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped. \nKAFFEE I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind of immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you're gonna appear as a witness for the defense, and you're gonna tell the court exactly what you told me. Right now I'm gonna check you into a motel, and we're gonna start from the beginning. \nMARKINSON I don't want a deal. And I don't want immunity. \nKAFFEE shakes his head and laughs. \nMARKINSON (continuing) I want you to know, I'm proud neither of what I've done nor what I'm doing. \nKAFFEE puts the car in gear and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nWhere KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed SAM and JO. \nThere's silence. \nThen JO has a total adrenaline rush. \nJO Where is he? \nKAFFEE The Route 23 Best Western. \nJO picks up the phone. \nJO I want him guarded. \nKAFFEE That's probably a good idea. \nJO (into phone) This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My clearance code is 411273. \nKAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM -- \nKAFFEE Clearance code? \nJO Thank you. \nKAFFEE (to SAM) I don't have a clearance code. Do you have a -- \nJO (into phone) It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a witness. \nJo continues giving information to the person on the phone, while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing down notes as fast as he can. \nKAFFEE He also said that Jessep's lying about the transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier. \nJO hangs up the phone. \nJO Damn. \nKAFFEE That was impressive. Did you hear what I just said about the flight? \nJO Yes. \nKAFFEE Sam, when a plane takes off from a base, there's gotta be some kind of record kept, right? \nSAM We need the Tower Chief's Log for GITMO. \nKAFFEE (to SAM) Get it. \nJO We're gonna win. \nKAFFEE Jo, don't get crazy about this. We don't know who Markinson is. We don't know what the log book's gonna say. You just concentrate on Downey. I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are. \nJO (sing-song) \"Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's got his case now.\" \nKAFFEE You are like seven of the strangest women I have ever met. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT \nA WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS, who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the back. \nROSS That was nice work today. The redirect on Howard. \nKAFFEE I have Markinson. \nROSS only takes a moment digest this. \nROSS Where is he? \nKAFFEE A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink. \nROSS Damn. \nKAFFEE The transfer order that Parkinson signed is phoney. And Jessep's statement that the six a.m. flight was the first available is a lie, we're checking the tower chief's log. But in the meantime I'm gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if we can't have a little fun. \nROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the line for Kaffee.. \nROSS I have an obligation to tell you that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you'll be subject to Court-Martial for professional misconduct. And that's something that'll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out. Markinson's not gonna hold up, he's a crazy man. I'm not saying this to intimidate you. I'm being your lawyer. \nKAFFEE Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I think the whole fuckin' bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something. \nROSS Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep and Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I'm your friend, Danny, and I'm telling you, I don't think your clients belong in jail. But I don't get to make that decision. I represent the Government of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a case. (pause) I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer of a felony without proper evidence. \nKAFFEE I've been so advised. \nROSS stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table. \n", "test2_true": "KAFFEE (pause) You're a lousy softball player, Jack. \nROSS Your boys are going down. I can't stop it anymore. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY \nPeople are filing in. KENDRICK is standing at the entrance to the courtroom. KAFFEE glides past him... \nKAFFEE Batter up, J.J. \nKENDRICK watches this impudent thing walk into the courtroom as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE COURTROOM - DAY \nKENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his emotions take control of his professional skill. \nSAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he needs them. \nKAFFEE Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private Santiago a good marine? \nKENDRICK I'd say he was about average. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on Santiago. On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below Average. \nKENDRICK Yes. Private Santiago was Below Average I didn't see the need in trampling on a man's grave. \nKAFFEE We appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and I think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth. \nKENDRICK I'm aware of my oath. \nKAFFEE's handed some more files. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey received three straight marks of Exceptional. Dawson received two marks of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this year, he received a rating of Below Average. It's this last report that I'd like to discuss for a moment. \nKENDRICK That's fine. \nKAFFEE Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after Infantry Training School was perfect. Records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has remained a lance corporal. Was Dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report. \nKENDRICK I'm sure it was. \nKAFFEE Do you recall why Dawson was given such a poor grade on this report? \nKENDRICK I'm sure I don't. I have many men in my charge, Lieutenant, I write many fitness reports. \nKAFFEE Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the Officer's Club? \nKENDRICK Yes. \nKAFFEE Did you report private Barnes to the proper authorities? \nKENDRICK I have two books at my bedside, Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct and the King James Bible. The only proper authorities I'm aware of are my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan R. Jessep and the Lord our God. \nKAFFEE Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority. \nROSS Objection. Argumentative. \nRANDOLPH Sustained. (to KAFFEE) Watch yourself, counselor. \nKAFFEE Did you report Private Barnes to your superiors? \nKENDRICK I remember thinking very highly of Private Barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge. \nKAFFEE You preferred it to be handled within the unit. \nKENDRICK I most certainly did. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red is? \nKENDRICK Yes I do. \nKAFFEE Have you ever ordered a code red? \nKENDRICK No, I have not. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days? \nKENDRICK That's a distortion of the truth. Private Barnes was placed on barracks restriction. He was given water and vitamin supplements, and I assure you that at no time was his health in danger. \nKAFFEE I'm sure it was lovely for Private Barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you? And you did order the denial of food. \nKENDRICK Yes. \nKAFFEE Wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red? \nKENDRICK (beat) Not necessarily. \nKAFFEE If I called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red? \nROSS Please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say. We object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness. \nRANDOLPH The Government's objection is sustained, Lt. Kaffee, and I would remind you that you're now questioning marine officer with an impeccable service record. \nROSS Thank you judge. \nKAFFEE looks over at DAWSON. They share a brief moment before KAFFEE turns back to KENDRICK. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to Private Barnes? (to ROSS) Not so fast. (to KENDRICK) Lieutenant? \nKENDRICK Corporal Dawson was found to be Below Average because he committed a crime. \n", "test3_input": "KAFFEE What crime did he commit? (beat) Lieutenant Kendrick? (beat) Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he commit? \nKENDRICK He disobeyed an order. \nKAFFEE And because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right? \nKENDRICK Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order. \nKAFFEE Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. (beat) Lt. Kendrick? (beat) Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow? (pause) \nKENDRICK No, he can not. \nKAFFEE A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes incident, am I right? \nKENDRICK I would think so. \nKAFFEE You know so, don't you, Lieutenant. \nROSS Object! \nRANDOLPH Sustained. \nKAFFEE Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question: if you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red... \nROSS -- please the court -- \nKENDRICK I told those men not to touch Santiago. \nKAFFEE -- is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again? \nROSS Lieutenant, don't answer that. \nKAFFEE You don't have to, I'm through. \nROSS doesn't even wait before he says -- \nROSS Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red? \nBut KENDRICK isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee. \nROSS (continuing) Lt. Kendrick, did you -- \nKENDRICK No I did not. \nROSS Thank you. \nCUT TO: \nFWAP! - a nerf ball slams into a hoop. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nINT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJO and KAFFEE. KAFFEE's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam walks in with some bound papers under his arm. \nKAFFEE What's the word? \nSAM This is the tower chief's log for that night. Jessep was telling the truth. The six a.m. flight was the first plane out. \nKAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands. \nKAFFEE Let me see that. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A MOTEL - NIGHT \nA SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next to them and KAFFEE jumps out. \nAGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE -- \nAGENT #1 Workin' late, lieutenant? \nKAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The door opens and KAFFEE walks into \nINT. MOTEL ROOM \nHE tosses the log book on the table. \nKAFFEE There was no flight out at eleven o'clock. What the fuck are you trying to pull? \nMARKINSON The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two. \nKAFFEE Then why the hell isn't it listed in the Tower Chief's log?! \nMARKINSON Why the hell did you think it would be?!! \nKAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in. \nKAFFEE What are you telling me? (beat) He fixed the log book? \nSetback. Big setback. \nKAFFEE (continuing) Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn't take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I'll get the log book from Andrews. \nMARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was born yesterday. \nKAFFEE (continuing; beat) He made an entire flight disappear? \nMARKINSON Nathan Jessep is about to be named Director of Operations for the National Security Council. You don't get to that position without knowing how to side-step a few land mines.

KAFFEE'S APARTMENT \nKAFFEE'S APARTMENT later that night and SAM and J0 have just heard the report him. \nKAFFEE There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight. A ground crew member. Someone. \nSAM Do you have any idea how many planes take off and land every day? A kid from the ground crew isn't gonna remember a flight that landed four weeks ago. \nKAFFEE Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order. That'll be enough. That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE HOLDING ROOM - DAY \nJo is working with DOWNEY.

In a matter of time, the trial of the two man charged with your son's death will be concluded, and seven men and two women whom you've never met will try to offer you an explanation as to why William is dead.

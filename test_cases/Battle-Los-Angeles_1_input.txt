(BEAT) Let's move. The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY. 
EXT. STREET - LATER 
Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy bungalows on either side. 
CPL. STAVROU You okay, bro? 
CPL. HARRIS I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get married, she'd still be in Chicago. Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as... A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING. The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD. 
SGT. NANTZ Under the cars! Now! The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as... 
A GIANT HOST OF ALIENS 
Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move. NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as... The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING. The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS, which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight. The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance. 
EXT. STREET - LATER 
The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians. Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly. Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand. 
PVT. IMLAY How far, sergeant? 
SGT. NANTZ One block over. Imlay smiles at Kerns. 
PVT. IMLAY We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're gonna make it... But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a glance with his corporals. 
MICHELE What's the matter? 
SGT. NANTZ The smell. An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as... ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early winter snow... 
THEN THEY TURN THE CORNER 
We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz. Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE. A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking horrified. We REVERSE to see... A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of... 
SANTA MONICA AIRPORT. As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation is slowly revealed: CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways. BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield. 
PVT. IMLAY Jesus... They wiped our Forward Operating Base right off the map. 
PVT. KERNS Now we know why those bombs never dropped. They took our jets out. 
CPL. CORREGGIO This was a dug-in marine Corps position that had armor, air and ground. Maybe we got nothing left to fight with... Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything-- 
THEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR. Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways. 
SGT. NANTZ Let's get under cover. Now. 
INT. DESERTED FIRE STATION - MOMENTS LATER 
The marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle the civilians inside when it appears safe. 
SGT. NANTZ Lock this place down. The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as... Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.

MAJOREK (under his breath) The smaller one. At the bottom. 
Szpilman nods and starts unloading the sacks as Majorek moves away. 
INT.  STORES - DAY 
Szpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner. He kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the string around its neck. 
He puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out. He reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds something. Carefully, he removes a pistol, then another, both wrapped in oil cloths. He hides them under his jacket. 
INT./EXT.  STORES AND BUILDING SITE - NIGHT 
Szpilman and a Jewish worker distribute the potatoes to the other Jewish workers lined up with empty containers of various kinds. There are scales on the table, and they weigh out five kilos of potatoes, pour them into the men's containers and drop in a loaf of bread. 
EXT. STREET LEADING TO GHETTO - NIGHT 
The Jewish workers, all carrying their parcels of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by two Polish policemen. Szpilman walks beside them. Ahead of him, Majorek near the front of the column. 
As the column nears the ghetto gates, Majorek tosses his package over the wall and when Szpilman reaches the same spot, he throws a similar package. The column marches on. 
INT. JEWISH BARRACKS - NIGHT 
A small room with several three-tiered bunk beds. The sound of men's heavy breathing and snoring. 
Szpilman lies awake, staring at the ceiling. He reaches inside his jacket, finds a scrap of paper and a pencil, writes something. 
He slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks, crouches down at the bottom one, where Majorek sleeps. 
SZPILMAN (whispered) Majorek! 
Majorek is instantly awake. 
SZPILMAN Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here. 
MAJOREK It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard. 
SZPILMAN I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. ( (He holds out the " piece of paper.) I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here? 
Majorek takes the paper but says nothing. He turns over and goes back to sleep. Szpilman returns to his bunk. 
INT. STORES - DAY 
Szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest sack. A sound alerts him. He looks round. 
An SS Lieutenant has entered the stores, sucking his finger, which is bleeding. 
SS LIEUTENANT Any fucking plaster? 
Szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First Aid tin, removes a plaster and gives it to the SS Lieutenant. 
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE (while he applies the plaster to his finger) What were you up to? 
Nothing from Szpilman. 
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE What the fuck are those? 
He indicates the sacks with his chin. 
SZPILMAN (in German) We're allowed to take food into the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes and a... 
The SS Lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the smallest one. 
SS LIEUTENANT Open it. 
SZPILMAN It's only potatoes and bread. 
SS LIEUTENANT Fuck that, you're lying, I can smell it. Open it. 
Szpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified and can't manage it. The SS Lieutenant shoves him out of the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the string. 
The SS Lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans. He glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again, produces a handful of oatmeal. 
SS LIEUTENANT You're all the same. Give a Jew a little finger, he takes the whole hand. 
He throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face.

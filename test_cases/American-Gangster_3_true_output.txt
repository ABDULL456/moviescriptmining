RIVERA What?   What are you talking about? 
Richie rips Rivera's jacket pockets.        Money spills out. 
RICHIE This.   Where'd this come from? 
RIVERA What. That's my money. I've never taken dirty money in my life. 
RICHIE You lying piece of shit - 
RIVERA Maybe the occasional gratuity. Like anybody else. You're going to tell me that's wrong? 
RICHIE Yeah. 
RIVERA No, it isn't. It's part of the salary for getting shot at. For that, certain courtesies are shown. In gratitude - 
Richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him.         Rivera is embarrassed, almost crying, pleading - 
RIVERA A discount on a TV, a Doughboy in the backyard, a new dress for your girlfriend maybe once a year. I'm talking about not living in fucking poverty. You want to call that wrong, call it wrong. 
RICHIE It's wrong. 
RIVERA Then goddamn it, pay me fifty grand a year, you son of a bitch. Pay me what I deserve for getting shot at. No? Fine. Next time four guys come into your place with sawed-off shotguns, you take care of it. 
RICHIE You robbed him, and then you shot him, and I helped you get out of there. How many more you shot? (CONT)

Rivera suddenly tries to get tough - 
RIVERA You know what, Richie? Fuck you, you make that kind of accusation against your own kind. And you know why. 
He takes out his car keys, turns to leave. Comes past Richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a line of puncture scabs and scars. 
RICHIE You're a disgrace. 
RIVERA I'm a leper. Because I listened to you and turned in a million fucking dollars. You know who'll work with me after that? Same as you. No one. 
Richie squeezes Rivera's hand around the car key. 
RICHIE Don't look down there. Look here. (at Richie's eyes) You ever fuckin threaten me again, I'll kill you. 
Richie squeezes Sander's hand so hard the car key cuts through the skin, drawing blood.

70      EXT. ARMY BASE, NEW JERSEY - DUSK                                70 Silence. Marshland. A beat-up Chevy parked alongside a perimeter fence. Frank waits by the car as a military Jeep with its lights out comes across a firing range. It slows, stops. In it, the silhouettes of three servicemen, black, armed with M-16's. Silence again, before: 
ARMY CAPTAIN Open the trunk. 
Frank does it, then stands aside as the other servicemen drag four large taped-up duffel bags from the Jeep to his car, lift them into his trunk and slam it shut. 
71      INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                           71 
The duffel bags, still closed, on a table. Frank regards them, nursing a drink, putting off the moment of discovery that he has perhaps spent his life's savings on nothing. (CONT) 
71    CONTINUED:                                                       71 
The German shepherd watches as Frank removes the tape from one of the bags. He pulls it open - has almost no reaction - except to breathe again - then opens the next, and the next. 
And we see: Several brick-like packages of No. 4 heroin wrapped in paper marked with Chinese writing, stamped with a label: two lions on their hind legs, paws on a globe, and, in English: DOUBLE UOGLOBE BRAND 100%. 
A72   INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAWN                           A72 
The duffel bags are elsewhere. The only evidence of any drugs is the small amount Frank has given a chemist - who looks like a Harvard student - to test. It responds instantly. The young man looks at Frank. 
CHEMIST Typically what I see is 25 to 45 percent pure. I've never seen anything like this. No alkaloids, no adulterants, no dilutents. It's a hundred percent. May I? 
The chemist opens a leather travel syringe kit to shoot up, but Frank gives him some to take home instead. 
FRANK Take it with you. I don't want to have to call the coroner. 
The chemist gathers his things to leave, offering a last piece of advice - 
CHEMIST Store it in a cool, dark place. 
72    EXT. GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA - DUSK                           72 
A clapboard house set down on a piece of land that was probably once worked by sharecroppers. An elderly woman framed in a lit kitchen window, doing dishes. 
Dark yew trees and scavenged, discarded cars and car parts like patches of rusty snow. Crickets and bullfrogs. From a mound of dirt, a young man hurls a baseball to another with a catcher's mitt exactly sixty feet away. The kid's got a major league arm. 
Legend:   Greensboro, North Carolina 
A glow spills out from a detached shed where a short man in his early 30's works on a stock car.

A greasy phone on the workbench rings and another disreputable-looking man, thumbing through a magazine, answers. 
JIMMY Yeah ... for you.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY 
BLINDING WHITENESS We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent. 
ON THE WOMAN'S FACE Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then... ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s). We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops. Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed. 
PAUL What's wrong? 
ANNA Nothing. Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor. 
PAUL 
(SIGHS WEARILY) You used to enjoy it. Now it's... He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette. 
PAUL ...it's like fucking a corpse. Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna. 
PAUL Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was-- Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul puts his head in his hands. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in. 
PAUL Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say.   But you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else. 
Anna doesn't reply. 
PAUL Is this about us? 
ON ANNA her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her. 
ANNA It's not about us. 
PAUL (O.C.) Then what is it? 
ANNA I don't know. 
PAUL (O.C.) I just want us to be happy. Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her. 
PAUL (O.C.) Are you happy? She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply. 
ANNA I'm happy. 
A DROP OF BLOOD falls into the water.   Then another drop. 
ON ANNA her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene... 
FADE TO WHITE. 
A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant. Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel. Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves. 
EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING 
A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery. Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 
A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING

81   INT.BLOOMSBURY SQ. ENTRANCE HALL.DUSK: LAST EMBERS.EVE.15 81    * DIDO enters the house, terrified, as she takes off her hood. MABEL passes in the corridor. DIDO Is anyone home, Mabel? 
MABEL Lord Mansfield. (Dido's heart plummets) I said you were out with Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray 
OFF DIDO'S relief/gratitude. She makes her way up the stairs quickly. 
82   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. DIDO/ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - EVE.15     82    * 
ELIZABETH falls back onto her bed, frustrated. 
ELIZABETH Urghhh! What if I shall never find someone so...so incomparably suitable...and wealthy?! DIDO What if he is suitable but you do not feel...`yourself' with him? ELIZABETH Oh Dido! He understood me. (beat) And whenever...whenever... he looked at me...I somehow felt better in this world... 
ELIZABETH'S voice trails. Her words force DIDO to turn away. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I am convinced his affections were growing...and I feel certain of my own love. 
DIDO Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!! ELIZABETH Dido! You stop it, won't you? You know no more of love than I myself, do you?! (deliberately pointed) Do you Dido? 
She holds her to account - willing DIDO to open up to her. DIDO stares daunted, then... DIDO No. Beat. ELIZABETH swallows hard, disappointed. 
ELIZABETH Then what better right do you have to name what I am feeling than me? OFF DIDO affected. 
83   EXT. LONDON. THAMES RIVER BANKSIDE. DAY.16                   83    * Decandence personified...a beautiful picnic, shaded by trees. Punts float up and down lackadaisically. ELIZABETH listens as LADY MANSFIELD interrogates a gentleman. 
LADY MANSFIELD How charming. Is that not charming, Elizabeth? And tell me, are you an only son? 
GENTLEMAN 1 I have six brothers, madam. 
LADY MANSFIELD'S smile stiffens. 
LADY MANSFIELD SIX! Goodness!...all..? 
He knows where this is going...defeated... GENTLEMAN 1 ...all older, madam, yes. 
Her smile falls away. LADY MANSFIELD Is that not a most fascinating display? He turns to look at the bush of flowers behind him. When he turns back, LADY MANSFIELD and ELIZABETH are gone. 
ON BARONESS VERNON (50s) who passes on a punt, utterly captivated as she waves. Her eyes are on DIDO, stunningly beautiful in fuchsia, beside OLIVER. BARONESS VERNON Oh how dreadfully wonderful Lady M. Your girl is a picture...an utter picture! With her...'intended'? LADY MANSFIELD Indeed, Baroness Vernon. 
BARONESS VERNON (re. ELIZABETH) AND I see the other does not give up...so terribly endearing! 
She stares across at ELIZABETH - ON BETTE'S contempt. BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) Now has she met Mr Willoughby... 
She points to a gent and leans into the bankside... BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) A very eligible widower - Three thousand yearly and no heir...yet! 
Her punt moves off as she waves gauche to two gentlemen passing in another. BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D) Mr Francis, Mr Smith...!!! You must meet the Mansfield girl! (She mouths) Still available!!

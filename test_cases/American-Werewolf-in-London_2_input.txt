ALEX I thought not. 
She tucks him in. 
ALEX You sleep now and have sweet dreams. 
BENJAMIN & ALEX No! 
For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window. 
53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT 
David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain. 
DAVID Jesus Christ! 
He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor. 
DAVID (screams) What?  Christ!  What? 
He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of his head.  He trembles violently. 
DAVID I'm burning up!  Jesus! 
He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is dripping wet. 
DAVID (shouts out in pain and fear) Jack!?  Where are you now, you fucker!?! 
As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish. 
DAVID Help me!  Somebody help me, please!  Jack!! 
David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at his legs. 
DAVID (pleading, whimpering) I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack. 
New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air. 
He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. 
The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. 
The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness. 
54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver and the cab drives off. 
WOMAN Which one, Harry? 
MAN Number thirty-nine, but let's go `round the back. 
WOMAN Why? 
MAN Come on, we'll give Sean a scare. 
WOMAN You're crazy, Harry. 
HARRY Come on. 
Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and quiet. 
55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
WOMAN Did you hear something? 
HARRY Just now? 
WOMAN Yes.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT 
Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS NOSE. 
DUKE (V/O) Ah, devil ether.  It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- (throws away kleenex) The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column.  Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it. 
DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care- taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug. 
DUKE (V/O) You approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there, everything goes wrong. 
THE ETHER KICKS IN: 
DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES, GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets. 
DUKE (V/O) Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on?  Then you hear yourself mumbling. 
DUKE (mumbling) Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My name is Brinks; I was born... Born? 
GONZO Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep. 
The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES. 
DUKE (V/O) Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas.  In this town they love a drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside. 
INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT 
Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE KOREAN KITTENS. 
The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly locked in a death battle. 
All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD, THE ROLL OF A DICE. 
DUKE (V/O) Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. 
Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to move out of the way. 
DUKE (V/O CONT'D) A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth but, nobody should be asked to handle this trip. 
GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths. One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE. 
FAIRGROUND BARKER Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend.  For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas. 
On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES. 
FAIRGROUND BARKER 99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet tall! 
ANOTHER BARKER Step right up!  Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat! 
INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT 
DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart. 
GONZO I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me.  I think I'm getting The Fear. 
DUKE Nonsense.  We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. 
GONZO That's what gives me The Fear. 
DUKE Look over there.  Two women fucking a Polar Bear. 
GONZO Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. (signals the waitress for two Wild Turkeys) This is my last drink.  How much money can you lend me? 
DUKE Not much.  Why? 
GONZO I have to go. 
DUKE GO? 
GONZO Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight. 
DUKE Calm down.  You'll be straight in a few hours.

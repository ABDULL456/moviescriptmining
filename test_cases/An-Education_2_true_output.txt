MARJORIE Wait for me. 
DAVID Before you start on that little lot , I have a surprise. Next weekend, we're all going to Chez Georges to celebrate Jenny's birthday. 
JACK (flatly) Lovely. 
DAVID Chez Georges is in the Boulevard St Germain. In Paris. 
Jenny giggles her delight. Jack's smile is a little more forced. 
JACK How d'you mean, Paris? 
JENNY You know the one, Dad. 
JACK (panic rising) But..We haven't got any French money. And I'm not sure...I just don't think it would agree with me. 
JENNY Dad! 
JACK They don't like us, the French, you know. John Sutton at work went once. They were very rude to him. I'm not sure I'd like that. 
Jenny understands David's ploy perfectly, and the role she must play. Her eyes fill with tears. Jack notices. 
JACK I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but...It's not for me, Europe. We'll go another time. 
JENNY (bitterly) You've just said you don't like Europe. What's going to change? It'll have to be Europe, won't it? Because it isn't going to be you. 
MARJORIE I can take her. 
JACK (genuinely indignant) To France? And leave me here on my own? 
JENNY Oh, for God's sake. 
Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out. 
DAVID Listen, I'm really sorry to have caused all this to-do. I just thought it might be nice. But I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle Daniel. They can have your tickets. 
Jack looks at him. 
JACK Aunt Helen? The one who went to the concert with you? 
DAVID Yes, that's the one. 
JACK (relieved) Well, there we are. 
DAVID (perplexed) Where are we? 
JACK Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there... 
DAVID (the penny apparently dropping) Of course! 
JACK I didn't want to put a spoke in anyone's wheels. But if you look at it from my angle...A bachelor, taking my daughter off to Paris... 
DAVID Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought it through properly. I do apologise, Jack. Would you prefer it if Helen took Jenny on her own? I don't mind. I've been to Paris before. 
JACK Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No, no. If Aunt Helen's going... 
He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David's eye and smiles. 
59   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          59 
Hattie, Tina and Jenny are sitting on their desks, waiting for a lesson to start. Hattie shows Jenny a piece of paper which apparently contains some kind of shopping list. 
TINA There are some things you must buy for us, and some things you only have to buy for us if you're a proper, true friend. (She points at Hattie, then at herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume. (She repeats the gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick. What have I forgotten? 
HATTIE Those funny cigarettes you were smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets each. 
A very small girl, twelve or thirteen, comes in to the classroom and approaches Jenny. 
SMALL GIRL Are you the girl going to Paris? 
Tina, Hattie and Jenny stare at her. 
SMALL GIRL Well are you or aren't you? Because I'd like some perfume. 
Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and essays. She sees the small girl and shoos her out. She then approaches Jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear. 
MISS STUBBS Jenny, the headmistress would like a word at the end of the lesson. I'm afraid that the legend of Mr Rochester may have travelled further than you intended. 
Jenny looks at her, startled and a little sick.

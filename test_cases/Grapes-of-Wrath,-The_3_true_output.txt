There is a grim pause at this news. Tim's eyes go hard. 
TIM (to Tom) You sure you got ever'thing ready? 
TOM (calmly) Ain't gonna be no trouble. 
TIM (worriedly) You ain't to hurt them fellas. 
WILKIE (grinning) You don't have to worry. We got ever'thing arranged. Maybe nobody'll even see it. 
TIM Just don't use no stick nor no knife, no piece a arn. An' if you got to sock 'em, sock 'em where they won't bleed. 
TOM Yes, sir. 
TIM Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor. 
TOM (blandly) Ain't gonna get outa han'. 
Wilkie makes a mocking military salute as he and Tom exit. The committee men look worriedly after them. 
FIRST MAN Mighty sure a themselves, looks like. 
TIM All I hope, I hope they don't kill nobody. 
In front of the JOAD TENT, dressed to kill, is Al, ready for the festivities. He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked down. He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor. 
At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters. Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped shirt. This is designed to stun his quarry. 
AL Gonna dance tonight? (The girl ostentatiously ignores him) I can waltz. 
GIRL (aloofly) That's nothin'--anybody can waltz. 
AL (shaking his head) Not like me! 
A fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent. 
WOMAN You git right along! This here girl's spoke for. She's gonna be married, an' her man's a-comin' for her. 
Shrugging, Al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the music, a very gay fellow indeed. The blonde girl's eyes follow him. Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent. 
ON THE DANCE FLOOR, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters and stands between them. This is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again. We also see the three men very casually looking around--but no more casual looking than Wilkie, standing just behind them, idly whistling. 
TOM (grinning) She's gettin' prettier, Ma. 
MA (as Rosasharn hides her face) Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier. 
The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the dance floor. The three men exchange a glance and step casually to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead. They survey the scene, but for the moment make no further move. The atmosphere is tense. 
TOM (softly) Excuse me, Ma. (He moves quietly out of the scene, toward the three men) 
AL, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor. Encircling her waist, they begin to dance. They are a smooth, rhythmic couple who move as one being. 
AL Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'? 
BLONDE GIRL Don't hold me so tight. 
AL (tongue-in-cheek) Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you! 
BLONDE GIRL (squirming) You're *ticklin' me!* 
AL (grabbing her still closer) That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.* 
BLONDE GIRL (complaining but loving it) Now I can't breathe. 
At this moment the leader of the three men (the other two directly behind him) enters the scene. 
LEADER I'll dance with this girl.

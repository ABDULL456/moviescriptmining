ADRIAN Don't do that again! 
PAULIE Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself!  So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me! 
ADRIAN Owe you what? 
PAULIE You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good! 
ADRIAN Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that?  So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me. 
The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat. 
PAULIE You busted?! 
ADRIAN What?! 
PAULIE You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!! 
Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie. 
ROCKY (fuming) Hey -- 
Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still. 
PAULIE (softly) ... I can't haul meat no more. 
ROCKY What can I do about it? 
PAULIE Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside. 
ROCKY What break?  Huh?  What break! Who am I to give breaks!  I'm a fighter, you haul meat.  You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man! 
Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns. 
ROCKY (continuing) ... An' what ya said to my girlfriend ain't right -- Do it again, I'll kill ya. 
Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and kisses her cheek. 
ROCKY (continuing) Wanna hear a dirty joke? 
ADRIAN (smiles) ... Yes -- 
INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like a huge dancer around the ring. 
MICKEY His defense is great, can't lie 'bout that -- You have a rollin' style.  Can't retreat as fast -- But your style ain't retreatin'. 
They both watch the flickering images. 
MICKEY (continuing) See how he plays sometimes -- Drives his cornermen nuts. Nobody knows his next move -- Him included. 
They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless against the ropes. 
MICKEY (continuing) Killer instinct -- Ya both got the killer touch.  Interestin'. See that! -- Right-cross combination.  Beautiful.  But you got the power to rip the body. 
They watch more action. 
MICKEY (continuing) Rocky, when ya climb into the square, an' know ya' meetin' the best fighter in the world, ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna be ready 'cause I been waitin' for fifty years -- Fifty years. When I'm done with you, you'll gonna be able to spit nails. (MORE) 
MICKEY (CONT'D) You'll gonna be able to eat lightin' and crap thunder -- You'll be a very, very dangerous person... 
The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring transfixed at the images projecting on the wall... 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY 
Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration. As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER 
Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell. The pain is evident on his face. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER 
Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders... Mickey coaching drives him on. 
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

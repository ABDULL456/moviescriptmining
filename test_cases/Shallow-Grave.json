{"test1_input": "Juliet is driving. David sits beside her. \nALEX I wasn't trying to win. \nThere is no response from Juliet. \nALEX (CONTINUED) I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. \nDAVID Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges. \nALEX You learn that in your psychotherapy group? \nDAVID Discussion group, Alex, discussion. \nJULIET I thought you stopped going. \nALEX Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that. \nAlex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex flies forward, elbows him in the chest. \nALEX (CONTINUED) God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing. \nJULIET Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful. \nALEX For my life? At a discussion group? I think not. \nJULIET For the flat. \nALEX No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry. \nJULIET She hated you -- \nALEX Well, she had problems -- \nJULIET -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life. \nALEX -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she? \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nOutside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits. Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark and bohemian in appearance. \nJULIET You must be Hugo. \nHUGO You must be Juliet. \nJULIET Would you like to come in? \nHUGO I'd be delighted. \nHugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately behind him. \nINT. VACANT ROOM. DAY \nHugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches him. He sits on the edge of the bed. \nHUGO It's nice. \n", "test1_true": "INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nHugo is seated on the sofa, Juliet sits opposite on an armchair. \nJULIET What do you do? \nHUGO Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel. \nJULIET What's it about? \nHUGO A priest who dies. \nJULIET I see. \nHUGO Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it. \nJULIET No. \nHUGO Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already. \nJULIET Writing seems easy. \nHUGO It's a breeze. \nThe telephone begins to ring out in the hall. Juliet does not move and at first says nothing. Hugo looks at her and towards the door leading to the hall. After several rings, Juliet speaks. \nJULIET Do you think you could answer that? \nHUGO The telephone? It continues to ring. \nJULIET Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in. \nJULIET No. \nHUGO All right. \nHugo stands up. The ringing continues. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nHugo lifts the phone. He turns to face Juliet and looks her in the eye as he lies on her behalf. \nHUGO Hello. Yes. Who's calling please? Well, I'm sorry, but she's not in right now. I don't know. Would you like to leave a message? \nHugo replaces the receiver. \nHUGO (CONTINUED) It was some guy called Brian. \nJULIET Did he sound upset? \nHUGO A little bit. Is that good or bad? \nJULIET It's an improvement. \nThe telephone begins to ring again. \n", "test1_id": 789, "test2_input": "DAVID I just thought we should discuss it. \nALEX Take his legs. \nINT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT \nIn the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They swear at one another and continue theri descent. \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT \nTim is ducking the Man again. He writhes and struggles but is powerless to stop it. \nEXT. BEHIND THE FLAT. NIGHT \nThe back yard and back door of the flats. The door opens and Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards the van. \nINT. LANDING OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM. NIGHT \nFrom the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely still. Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down. \nANDY You stupid bastard. \nINT. VAN. NIGHT \nInside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the door. \nINT. VAN. NIGHT \nIn front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. Alex turns to the other two. \nALEX Why don't we just draw lots for it? \nThe other two remain silent. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing. \nJULIET OK. \nALEX David? \nDAVID I don't know. \nALEX Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't. \nAlex starts the engine of the van. \nEXT. FOREST. NIGHT \nThrough the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of the van come into view. \nIt pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the van. \nIn fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds them out. \nALEX All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play or not? \nAlex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one of the stems. It is one of the larger ones. \n", "test2_true": "DAVID I can't do it. \nEXT. FOREST. NIGHT \nDeeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at another. \nAlex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He observes David impassively. The sawing stops again. \nDAVID Finished. \nALEX But not quite. \nDAVID Is that going to be deep enough? \nAlex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards David. \nALEX Don't you worry about that. \nDAVID Is this necessary? \nALEX Yes. Now come on, all or nothing. \nMost reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who gestures as if to say, \"On you go.' With revulsion on his face, he raises the hammer above his head. \nINT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY \nDavid's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his pillow. \nHe lies fully clothed on his bed, looking up at the ceiling. There is a knock at the door, then Juliet walks in. \nJULIET Are you all right? \nDAVID (without looking at Juliet) Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine. \nJULIET Would you like to talk about it? \nDAVID No. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nAlex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show, while eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer. Newspapers lie scattered at his feet. \nINT. LOFT. DAY \nThe loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, letting in a pool of light. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nDavid is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it on up to David. \nJULIET Be careful. \nALEX Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me? \nJULIET Stop nagging. \n", "test2_id": 790, "test3_input": "There follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan. \nALEX Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same again. \nAlex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play button on a tape recorder. The music begins. \nFast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is switched on and off. \nAlex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas. \nJuliet wearing several different outfits. \nBoth of them posing with small objets d'art. \nThe expensive watch on Alex's wrist. \nJuliet's jewellery. \nExpensive toys. \nJuliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera. \nAlex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie. \nALEX (CONTINUED) This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and you know, I'm so happy I could die. \nDarkness. TV. Turned off. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nThe music has stopped. \nDavid presses the eject button and lifts the video from the player. \nAlex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed. Juliet is holding the Polaroid of Alex. \nDAVID I think we ought to scrub this, don't you? \nDavid reinserts the tape and presses record. \nALEX Will you calm down. \nJULIET Yeah, you're making us all nervous. \nDavid picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then picks up a vase. \nDAVID How much did you pay? \nALEX I don't know. \nDAVID How much did you pay? \nALEX I don't know. \nDAVID How much? \nALEX I don't know. \n", "test3_true": "DAVID Two hundred pounds? \nJULIET Two hundred pounds. \nDAVID You paid two hundred pounds for this? \nJULIET That's what it cost, David. \nDAVID No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet. \nFrom out in the hall, the phone starts to ring. Nobody moves. \nINT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT \nDavid lies awake in his bed. \nINT. A FLAT HALLWAY. NIGHT \nHearing the noise, David sits up in bed, then gets out, reaching for his clothes. \nINT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT \nDavid looks down the stairwell. Other neighbours, in nightclothes or hurriedly dressed, are standing at the open door of the flat below. David descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of the other flat where the occupant, an Elderly Woman, lies groaning on the floor. \nA hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man carrying a stretcher. \nDAVID Did they take anything? Did they take anything? \nNo one acknowledges his question or answers it. \nThe ambulance men emerge carrying the woman, her face bruised and cut. Everyone else begins to melt away. \nINT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT \nDavid stands alone on the darkened stairwell. \nINT. DAVID'S ROOM. NIGHT \nDavid lies awake in his bed. \nINT. DOOR OF THE FLAT. DAY \nSomeone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are two new security chains on the inside. The door is forced against the chains with no success and Alex calls from the other side. \nALEX What is this? What is going on? David! \nDavid approaches the door. \nDAVID I'll let you in. \nDavid closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see Alex grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the door again. Alex walks in. \nALEX What is this? \nDAVID Security. \n", "test3_id": 791}

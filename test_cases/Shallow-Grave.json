{"train": "Juliet is driving. David sits beside her. \nALEX I wasn't trying to win. \nThere is no response from Juliet. \nALEX (CONTINUED) I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win. \nDAVID Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges. \nALEX You learn that in your psychotherapy group? \nDAVID Discussion group, Alex, discussion. \nJULIET I thought you stopped going. \nALEX Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that. \nAlex leans close to Juliet. Juliet brakes abruptly and, as Alex flies forward, elbows him in the chest. \nALEX (CONTINUED) God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing. \nJULIET Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful. \nALEX For my life? At a discussion group? I think not. \nJULIET For the flat. \nALEX No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry. \nJULIET She hated you -- \nALEX Well, she had problems -- \nJULIET -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life. \nALEX -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she? \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nOutside the door of the flat Hugo rings the bell and waits. Juliet opens the door. Hugo is in his early thirties, tall, dark and bohemian in appearance. \nJULIET You must be Hugo. \nHUGO You must be Juliet. \nJULIET Would you like to come in? \nHUGO I'd be delighted. \nHugo walks in and Juliet closes the door quite deliberately behind him. \nINT. VACANT ROOM. DAY \nHugo looks around, pleased at what he sees, while Juliet watches him. He sits on the edge of the bed. \nHUGO It's nice. \nHUGO Shall I answer it? \nJULIET No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week. \nThe telephone continues to ring. \nHUGO Working nights? \nJULIET I'm a doctor. \nHUGO And he's a patient of yours? \nJULIET No. But he needs treatment. \nHUGO For what? \nJULIET A certain weakness. \nHUGO The human condition. \nJULIET You know about it? \nHUGO I write about it? \nJULIET And that's not the same thing? \nHUGO No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self. \nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING \nJuliet, dressed and fatigued, sits at the table sipping a coffee. Alex is also seated at the table, but wearing an old dressing- gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and talks at the same time. An array of other papers is spread over the table. \nALEX Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things. \nJULIET He seemed like a nice guy, Alex. \nJuliet gets up and leaves the kitchen. The soundof a bath running is heard. \nALEX I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is, it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's on about, you know. \nAlex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to leave the kitchen and get it. \nJULIET (calling from outside) He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know -- \nINT. BATHROOM.MORNING. \nJuliet watches the bath fill. \nJULIET ...interesting. \nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING \nAlex considers her reply. \nALEX Interesting. Interesting. \nINT. HALL. MORNING \nDAVID People can be so cruel. \nALEX So, uh... \nHUGO What? \nALEX What? \nHUGO You were going to say something. \nALEX What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right? \nJULIET Just get on with it, Alex. \nDAVID Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now. \nALEX We think it's fine. \nAlex starts eating again. The others watch him expectantly. David coughs. \nALEX (CONTINUED) It's OK. There's no problem. \nHUGO You mean I can have the room? \nALEX Well, that's what I said, isn't it? \nDAVID He made it clear. \nALEX Why, thank you, David. \nJULIET Yes, you can have the room. \nAlex pours yet more alcohol. \nALEX I'm not usually drunk. \nJULIET Not usually this drunk. \nDAVID Only on expenses. \nALEX It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper... \nWith exaggerated scorn, Alex knocks over a glass of wine. \nJULIET In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone -- \nALEX It was you, Juliet, it was you -- \nJULIET -- instead of what he is -- \nALEX What I am. \nJULIET -- which is -- \nALEX -- which is a hack. \nJULIET The man we know and love. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY \nHugo unpackshis bags. Included in his things are a few syringes and needles. All these he puts into the drawer beside his bed. He checks inside a second bag. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nHugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply. \nINT. JULIET'S ROOM. EVENING \nJuliet is woken by her alarm clock. The time is five p.m. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nAlex sits watching television, constantly changing channels. Juliet walks in, wearing a dressing gown. She watches Alex for a few moments. \nJULIET Have you seen Hugo? \nALEX No. Any idea which channel he's on? \nINT. HALL. MORNING \nThe telephone is ringing. Alex lifts up the reciever. Again he is wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail. \nALEX No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Have you seen him? \nDAVID Alex, I don't have the time -- \nALEX Yes or no, yes or no, yes or -- \nDAVID No. \nDavid leaves, slamming the door. \nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING \nAlex returns to the kitchen, pausing only to knock at Hugo's door, which elicits no response. In the kitchen Juliet sits dressed for work, having just returned. He casually opens an envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing it to her. \nALEX David hasn't seen him either. \nJULIET So I gathered. \nALEX Maybe he didn't like us. \nJULIET David? \nALEX Hugo. \nJULIET His car's still there. \nALEX He's got a car? \nJULIET So what's wrong with that? \nALEX What sort of car? \nJULIET What are you doing? \nALEX I'm just looking. \nJULIET Don't. \nALEX Don't look? \nJULIET No. \nALEX Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from? \nJULIET No.The guy's dead.What more do you need? \nALEX It's not every day I find a story in my own flat. \nJULIET Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse. \nALEX Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet. \nIn a drawer in a bedside cabinet, Alex finds needles, syringes and a small bag of powder. Without comment, he holds it up and throws it on the bed. \nHe reaches under the bed and pulls out a case, which he opens. It is empty and he pushes it back under. \nDAVID I've never seen a dead body before. \nJULIET Alex, I think it's time for you to stop. \nAlex continues to search. Juliet walks out. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nJuliet stands alone. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT \nAlex continues his brisk search through Hugo's posesseions while David looks on, appalled but speechless. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nJuliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom, then picks up the telephone. She dials 999 and waits for a reply. It rings and rings. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. NIGHT \nAlex has found and opened a large Gladstone bag. Neither David norwe can see into it. \nDAVID I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time. \nALEX Can I show you something? \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nJuliet awaits an answer. \nAlex approaches Juliet with the open bag. She turns around and looks into it, then, seeing the contents, she replaces the receiver. As she does so, the Operator's voice is audible for a second. \nOPERATOR Hello, emergency services. \nALEX Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry the Hamster from House of Horror'. All right... well, that's a pity, you see, no pets, no human angle. \nAlex hangs up. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY \nAnother view of the body: for example, from above. \nINT. HOSPITAL. DAY \nIn the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital, Juliet sifts through a setof casenotes. Another Doctor approaches her. \nDOCTOR Hi, there. \nJuliet does not look up. \nJULIET Hello. \nDOCTOR What happened to that guy? \nJULIET What guy? \nDOCTOR That guy, the one that died. \nJuliet looks up. \nJULIET What guy that died? \nDOCTOR That one, last week. \nJULIET Here?. \nDOCTOR Yeah, here, I mean, where else? \nJULIET Oh, him. Well, he died. \nDOCTOR (SATISFIED) That's what I thought. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY \nThe body, stillpresent, exposed and motionless. The curtain flutters by the open window. \nINT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY \nLumsden, a middle-aged chartered accountant, isseated in a largechair behind a desk. He is talking to David,who appears distracted. \nLUMSDEN What do we do here, David? \nDAVID Sorry? \nLUMSDEN Here. \nDAVID Right here? \nLUMSDEN In this firm. \nDAVID Well, it's a wide range of, eh -- \nThe corpse as before. \nINT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY \nDavid sits at his desk, looking across the office. \nCrouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is speaking except in muted tones on the telephones. \nDavid watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants sit. \nHe turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large total at the bottom. \nWhen David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding scene. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. EVENING \nThe body in silhouette. \nDAVID (VOICE-OVER) OK. Let's do it. \nINT. DIY STORE. DAY \nInside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked with potentially vicious tools. \nALEX (VOICE-OVER) All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as simple as that. \nAs the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is holding it. \nALEX (CONTINUED) I always wondered what these were for. \nAlex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Now this is what we need. And this. \nAlex hands the tools to David, who looks at them with disgust. Alex walks on. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Now what else? DAVID I don't know. \nALEX A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit. \nDAVID So who's going to do it? \nALEX Dig the pit, I don't know. \nDAVID No, not that. \nALEX Then what? Who's going to do what? \nDAVID You know what I'm talking about. \nALEX Do I? What? What? What are you talking about? \nDAVID You know what. Who's going to do it. \nALEX We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough? \nDAVID I can't do it. \nDAVID I just thought we should discuss it. \nALEX Take his legs. \nINT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT \nIn the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They swear at one another and continue theri descent. \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT \nTim is ducking the Man again. He writhes and struggles but is powerless to stop it. \nEXT. BEHIND THE FLAT. NIGHT \nThe back yard and back door of the flats. The door opens and Alex, David and Juliet emerge, carrying the corpse out towards the van. \nINT. LANDING OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM. NIGHT \nFrom the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom. The Man's legs extend away from the bath. They are completely still. Andy and Tim stand beside them, looking down. \nANDY You stupid bastard. \nINT. VAN. NIGHT \nInside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside. The door is closed and in the dark interior, the outline of the plastic lump is just visible, thanks to a streetlight. One of the doors opens again and David throws a bag of tools in. He then closes and locks the door. \nINT. VAN. NIGHT \nIn front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. Alex turns to the other two. \nALEX Why don't we just draw lots for it? \nThe other two remain silent. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing. \nJULIET OK. \nALEX David? \nDAVID I don't know. \nALEX Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't. \nAlex starts the engine of the van. \nEXT. FOREST. NIGHT \nThrough the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of the van come into view. \nIt pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the van. \nIn fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds them out. \nALEX All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play or not? \nAlex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one of the stems. It is one of the larger ones. \nALEX (to himself) I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge. \nINT. LOFT. DAY \nDavid moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way across beams and pipes. There are no skylights. \nHe stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He strains to see in the darkness. \nSuddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out. \nDavid scrambles towards the trapdoor. \nINT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY \nNow clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation. \nINT. HOSPITAL. DAY \nIn a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues past. \nEXT. QUARRY. EVENING \nAlex pushes a blue car into a quary. \nINT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT \nIn the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to Andy, who declines. \nThey slide off the deep freeze and open it. \nInside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. They lift him up. He is very cold and weak. \nThe Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly. \nThey push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top. \nINT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT \nAlex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the addition of a significant number of kilts. \nNeither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak to them. \nA middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to the diners who are still sat at their tables. \nMC Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit. \nThere is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans across to Juliet. \nALEX You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down. \nSome other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex. \nJULIET Sshh. \nALEX I want my money back. Excuse me. \nAlex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already ists in front of him. \nALEX What's the problem? \nDAVID I want to talk now. \nALEX After you drink to love and happiness forever. \nDAVID Now. \nALEX After. \nJULIET David, I promise we will. Keep him happy. \nALEX It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever. \nDavid reaches out to take his glass. Suddenly, Alex flings an arm out to point, knocking over David's glass and completely losing interest. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Look over there. It's Cameron. \nJULIET Who? \nALEX Cameron. You remember Cameron. \nJULIET No, I don't. \nALEX What's he doing here? \nJULIET That's not him. \nALEX Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo! \nFrom some distance away, Cameron becomes aware of Alex and cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from the table. \nCAMERON What? \nALEX Nothing. We thought you were someone else. \nAlex falls forward, laughing, and the other two also laugh as Cameron walks away, humiliated again. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around? \nDAVID Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this -- \nBRIAN (UNSEEN) The divine Juliet. Long time no see. \nBrian approaches and is standing behind their table. \nJULIET Brian. \nBRIAN Would you care to dance? \nDAVID Hold on there. Who do you think you are? \nBRIAN What? \nDAVID Who do you think you are? You interrupted us. \nBRIAN I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you? \nThere follows a video depicting the results of Alex's and Juliet's spending spree. It opens with Alex seated at the kitchen table talking to the camera, absolutely deadpan. \nALEX Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same again. \nAlex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play button on a tape recorder. The music begins. \nFast cuts follow, occasionally interrupted by out-of-focus shots of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is switched on and off. \nAlex wearing several different suits, outfits and silk pyjamas. \nJuliet wearing several different outfits. \nBoth of them posing with small objets d'art. \nThe expensive watch on Alex's wrist. \nJuliet's jewellery. \nExpensive toys. \nJuliet takes a picture of Alex with a Polaroid camera. \nAlex holds the camcorder out at arm's length in order to film himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie. \nALEX (CONTINUED) This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and you know, I'm so happy I could die. \nDarkness. TV. Turned off. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nThe music has stopped. \nDavid presses the eject button and lifts the video from the player. \nAlex and Juliet are seated on the sofa, surrounded by their acquisitions, and are evidently a little embarrassed. Juliet is holding the Polaroid of Alex. \nDAVID I think we ought to scrub this, don't you? \nDavid reinserts the tape and presses record. \nALEX Will you calm down. \nJULIET Yeah, you're making us all nervous. \nDavid picks up the Polaroid of Alex and throws it down, then picks up a vase. \nDAVID How much did you pay? \nALEX I don't know. \nDAVID How much did you pay? \nALEX I don't know. \nDAVID How much? \nALEX I don't know. \nALEX He can't stay up there. \nJULIET He'll come down. Leave him alone. \nALEX Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that? \nJULIET No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem? \nALEX Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it. \nINT. HOSPITAL. DAY \nJuliet looks through the door from a small office out into the main waiting area in the casualty departmet. It is busy and there are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen. More file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nThe trapdoor opens. David's head appears. He looks around and listens carfeully. \nINT. LUMSDEN'S OFFICE. DAY \nLumsden answers his telephone. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nDavid speaks on the telephone. \nDAVID It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with her just now. I don't know. The doctors aren't sure. It could go either way. Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch. \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY \nDavid shaves carefully with a safety razor. \nINT. KITCHEN. DAY \nBacon and eggs fry in a pan. David attends to them while drinking from a large tumbler of orange juice. \nINT. HOSPITAL. DAY \nA Sister hands Juliet a casualty case sheet. Juliet reads it. \nJULIET Painful groin? What does that mean? \nSISTER I don't know. He wouldn't show me. \nJuliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle. Alex is sitting on a trolly. ALEX Boy, am I glad to see you. \nJULIET What are you doing here? \nALEX We have to talk. \nJULIET Your painful groin? \nShe turns and walks away. Alex chases after her. \nALEX Later. But first -- him. \nJULIET David? \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nAlex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat. \nIn a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words apart from slightly muffled cries. \nAt the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly again, he takes the crowbar out. \nALEX It's in the loft. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nThe trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nTim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nIt is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nAway from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is David. He stands perfectly still. \nThere is a hammer in his right hand. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nTim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nThe hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nDavid stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT \nAndy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks back and up towards the trapdoor. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nOnce again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only centimetres from his own. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nAlex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. \nTim's body lands on Andy. \nDavid drops himself from the hatch to the floor. \nDavid takes a large knife from a wooden block. \nAlex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as though he expects to hear them or see somwthing. \nEventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop. \nAlex looks up. \nWithout warning there is the sound of an electric drill. \nThe blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear. \nINT. VARIOUS CEILINGS. NIGHT \nHoles are drilled in the ceilings. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nRods of light penetrate up from the holes, interrupting but not obliterating the darknes. David sits back, pleased with his work. \nINT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT \nJuliet sits at her desk. Alex stands in the doorway. He is about to speak. Juliet raises a finger to her lips. They both look at the ceiling. \nEXT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT \nEstablishing shot of Alex and Juliet in garden. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nThe trapdoor is open. \nINT. ALEX'S ROOM. NIGHT \nDavid is searching through Alex's desk, looking through letters and folders, then shoving them back into drawers. \nEXT. GARDEN AT THE FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT \nALEX No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further. \nJULIET It's the only way. \nALEX I refuse. \nJULIET You're frightened. \nALEX No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up. \nINT. JULIET'S ROOM. NIGHT \nDavid is now searching through Juliet's desk. He picks up a large brown envelope and looks into it. Beneath it is the airline ticket envelope. \nThe doorbell rings. \nINT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT \nMcCall and Mitchell stand outside the door. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nDAVID I see. \nMCCALL I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything? \nDAVID No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up. \nMCCALL Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't? \nDAVID I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper. \nUncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has underlined a short segment of it. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nIn the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks on. \nMCCALL Loks like you had a break-in up here as well. \nDAVID Someone lost the key. \nMcCall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall illuminates Hugo's room. \nMCCALL Is this where no one stays? \nDAVID Yeah, that's right, that's it. \nDavid notices that Mitchell is writing this down. \nINT. GARDEN AT FRONT OF THE FLAT. NIGHT \nALEX You'll wait in the hall? \nJULIET I'll wait there. \nALEX And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything? \nJULIET Everything. \nALEX Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood. \nJULIET Alex. \nALEX What? \nJULIET As smart as you are, you'll need a little help. \nShe hands Alex a Yale key. Alex stares at it. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nIn the darkness, the sound of the lock being turned is heard. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nAlex tsands at the top of the ladder, holding the key in the trapdoor lock. \nALEX All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you remain calm. \nDAVID Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to? \nJULIET No one. I promise. \nDAVID Who have you talked to? \nJULIET No one. \nDAVID If I think you're lying -- \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nAlex stands gazing around the loft. \nALEX (from the loft) Well, it's not up here. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nDavid pulls Juliet to one side. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nAlex is about to descend when he notices the water tank. He walks over and lifts the lid. His face breaks into a smile as he realizes what it holds. He dips an arm into the tank, raises the yellow bag, then quickly lowers it again. Alex steps back from the water tank. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nAlex appears at the top of the ladder. Without looking, he slides down as quickly as he can, calling out as he does so. \nALEX Juliet, I have -- \nAlex reaches the base of the ladder. He turns around to find himself facing the blade of the battery-operated drill, held by David. Juliet stands off to one side. \nALEX (CONTINUED) -- a problem. \nDavid holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the centre of Alex's forehead and presses the trigger' to turn the blade slowly as he speaks. \nAlex does not move at all. \nDAVID You looking for me? \nALEX Looking for you? Yes. \nDAVID What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it? \nALEX We just wanted to speak to you. \nAlex's hands and sleeves are wet. A few drops of water fall from his fingertips. Unnoticed by the other two, he slowly wipes his hands on the back of his jeans. \nDAVID Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd already got me. \nThe blade os the drill scrapes Alex's skin. \nALEX Who? \nDAVID Your friends. \nALEX I don't know what you're talking about. \nINT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY \nThe room is empty. \nThe sound of the flat door closing is heard. \nFrom David's point of view we see: \nINT. LOFT/HALL (EMPTY). DAY \nINT. LOFT/LIVING ROOM (EMPTY). DAY \nINT. LOFT/KITCHEN (EMPTY). DAY \nINT. HALL. DAY \nDavid's head appears beneath the trapdoor. He hangs from the hatch and drops down to the floor. \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY \nDavid showers. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nDavid emerges from the bathroom and walks towards the kitchen. We follow him in. \nINT. KITCHEN. DAY \nDavid takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his voice is impassive. \nDAVID I thought you'd gone to work. \nJULIET (UNSEEN) With a face like this? \nINT. KITCHEN. DAY \nJuliet's face. There are bruises across it where she was gripped by David. \nINT. MONITOR SCREEN/NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY \nIn close-up we track along the following half-sentence: In the event of my death I want the following facts to be known:' -- \nThe remainder of the screen is blank. \nAlex sits at his desk, deciding what to type next on the screen seen before. A young Office Boy approaches his desk. \nOFFICE BOY The editor wants to see you. \nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING \nDavid sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him. \nJULIET I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked after you. \nINT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY \nAlex sits nervously while the Editor sits on the side of his desk. \n", "test1_input": "SHALLOW GRAVE \nWritten by \nJohn Hodge \nFINAL DRAFT \nINT. DAY \nA blurred image forms on a white screen. A horizontal strip of face, eyes motionless and unblinking. \nDAVID (VOICE-OVER) Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your way. If you can't trust your friends, well, what then? \nEXT. DAWN \nA series of fast-cut static scenes of empty streets. \nDAVID (VOICE-OVER) This could have been any city: they're all the same. \nA rapid, swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow lanes and passageways. Accompanied by soundtrack and credits. \nThe track ends outside a solid, fashionable Edinburgh tenement. \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nAt the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David Stevens, and Juliet Miller. \nA man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is answered. \nCAMERON Hello, I've come about the room. \nCameron enters and the door closes. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nDavid, Alex, and Juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly opposite Cameron, who shifts uneasily in his armchair. Alex checks some items on a clipboard before speaking. \nALEX What's his name? \nDAVID I don't know -- Campbell or something? \nJULIET Cameron. \nALEX Cameron? \nJULIET Yes. \nALEX (to Juliet) Really? \nCAMERON That's right. \nALEX (to Cameron) What? \nCameron is not sure what to say. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Well, Cameron, are you comfortable? \n", "test1_true": "ALEX Good. Well, you've seen the flat? \nCAMERON Yes. \nALEX And you like it? \nCAMERON Oh, yes, it's great. \nALEX Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think? \nCAMERON Yes. \nALEX Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap. \nCAMERON Well, yes. \nALEX So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you? \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nAs Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue. \nALEX (VOICE-OVER) \nI mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I don't think you're even trying. \nCameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main door. \nALEX (CONTINUED) And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck! \nCameron leaves and the main door closes behind him. \nALEX (CONTINUED) Do you think he was upset? \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nInside the hall of the flat, David approaches the door toopen it. Freeze-frame. \nALEX (VOICE-OVER) David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'. \nDavid opens the door to the Woman. \nWOMAN I've come to see about the room. \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nOutside the door of the flat a young Goth girl, aged about twenty, rings the doorbell. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nInside the hall of the flat Alex approaches the door to open it. Freeze-frame. \nJULIET (VOICE-OVER) Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, though there was a time when, well, there was a time when... \nAlex opens the door to the Goth. \n", "test1_id": 789, "test2_input": "GOTH I've come about the room. \nINT. STAIRWELL. DAY \nAt the door of the flat a Man aged about thrity-five rings the bell. \nINT. HALL. DAY \nInside the hall of the flat Juliet approaches the door to open it. Freeze-frame. \nDAVID (VOICE-OVER) Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I think of Juliet. \nJuliet opens the door to the Man. \nMAN I've come about the room. \nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY \nIn the living room each of the candidates is interviewed individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see some facial reaction. \nAll of David's questions are to the Woman. \nAll of Alex's questions are to the Goth. \nAll of Juliet's questions are to the Man. \nDAVID All right, just a few questions. \nALEX I'd like to ask you about your hobbies. \nJULIET Why do you want a room here? \nDAVID Do you smoke? \nALEX When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire? \nJULIET I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda? \nDAVID Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time? \nALEX Or maybe just phone out for a pizza? \nJULIET Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not. \nDAVID OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band. \nALEX When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear? \nJULIET Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman? \nDAVID Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing? \nALEX With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe? \nJULIET It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that. \nDAVID Did you ever kill a man? \n", "test2_true": "JULIET OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love. \nDAVID And what if I told you that I was the antichrist? \nINT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING \nIn a sports centre Juliet sits outside a glass-walled squash court. She is ready to play, but at present is watching Alex and David, who are inside the court. \nINT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING \nInside the squash court, Alex is about to serve. \nALEX Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination. \nDAVID Serve. \nALEX I was trying to educate you. \nDAVID Just serve. \nALEX In the same fashion as chess. \nDAVID What? \nALEX Chess. Chess is often used as well. \nDAVID Will you shut up and play. \nALEX You're a bad loser. \nDAVID I haven't lost yet. \nAlex serves. \nINT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING \nThe squash-court door opens and David walks out past Juliet as Alex stands behind, jabbing his finger at him. \nALEX Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, professional, sexual, everything. Next. \nJuliet walks in and closes the door. \nINT. SQUASH COURT. EVENING \nInside the squash court Alex is about to serve. \nALEX Did you know -- \nJULIET Just serve. \nAlex serves. \nINT.

Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six. \nAlex hands David a rolled-up newspaper. \nDAVID Doesn't it worry you? \nALEX No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me. \nAlex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the trapdoor. \nALEX (CONTINUED) What's all this for, more security? \nDAVID I fitted a lock up there. On the inside. \nALEX Oh, that'll come in useful. \nINT. KITCHEN. NIGHT \nAlex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta. \nDavid and Juliet sit at the tabel. \nJULIET Is this the same stuff you made last week? \nALEX No, no, it's different. \nJULIET I hope it tastes better than the other stuff. \nALEX It tastes different. \nJULIET I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey! \nDAVID What? Yes, that's fine. \nALEX You're sure? There's lots more. \nDAVID No, I'm sure, that'll be enough. \nALEX What's wrong? \nDAVID Nothing. \nALEX You're not eating. \nDAVID Not eating what? \nALEX Not eating like you used to, that's what. \nDAVID If you give me the plate, I'll eat. \nAlex hands him the plate and he starts to eat. Alex watches him chew a mouthful. \nALEX Now swallow. \n", "test3_true": "ALEX (CONTINUED) You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice. \nJULIET He's right. You'd feel much better about it. \nDavid has stopped eating. \nALEX Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it. \nJULIET Be like a weight off your shoulders. \nALEX You know we're right. \nJULIET Don't you? \nDAVID I want to secure it. \nALEX Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it? \nJULIET I don't see the point in that. \nALEX Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing -- \nDAVID Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off. \nThere is silence. David resumes eating. \nDAVID (CONTINUED) It tastes different. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nAlex stands at the sink doing some washing up. He hears footsteps from the loft above. He stops what he is doing and walks slowly out ot the hall. \nINT. LOFT. NIGHT \nIn the darkness we can just make out David's eyes as he sits in darkness. \nALEX (calling from below) David, David, what are you doing up there? \nThe torch goes on. David lifts the bag of money from between the rafters. He puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag, which he ties tightly with string. \nDavid opens the water tank. \nAlex's voice can be heard throughout. \nALEX (continued; calling from below) Will you come down now. It's not safe up there. Are you listening to me. Security and insanity are not the same thing. \nINT. HALL. NIGHT \nALEX Shit. \nINT. KITCHEN. NIGHT \nJuliet sits drinking coffee, while Alex sands in the doorway looking up towards the trapdoor. \nJULIET Leave him alone. \n", "test3_id": 791}

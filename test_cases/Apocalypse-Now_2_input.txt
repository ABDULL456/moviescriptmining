Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement their need increases by the square. 
31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN 
They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat, which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows, then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below. 
Such are the ways of war. 
CUT TO: 
32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY 
The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline. There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle. 
WILLARD (V.O.) Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing but us and the coastline. I felt like I had set off for the center of the earth... 
Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead. 
CHIEF Smoke ! 
WILLARD Where ? 
They all turn. Chief points up the coast. 
33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE 
A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle. 
WILLARD Black smoke ... secondary burning. 
The Chief grabs field glasses. 
CHIEF Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em. 
WILLARD First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River. 
34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE 
A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf. 
35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW 
They wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men. 
Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men. 
We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it. 
36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS 
Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out- side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall, strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache. 
He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle. His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses. 
KILGORE (bellowing) Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards -- give me some room to breathe. 
A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off. 
37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD 
He was not quite prepared for this. 
38  VIEW ON KILGORE 
turning to his GUARDS 
KILGORE Bring me some cards. 
GUARD Sir ? 
KILGORE Body cards, you damn fool -- cards ! 
The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance. 
WILLARD (formally) Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission. 
KILGORE (not looking up) Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain. 
He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The others follow, 
39  TRACKING VIEW 
The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on it -- carefully picking out which card he uses. 
KILGORE (to himself) Six a spades -- eight a hearts -- Isn't one worth a Jack in this whole place. 
The Colonel goes on about this business. 
40  TRACKING ON KILGORE 
moving through the corpses, dropping the cards. 
On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him. He stops. 
KILGORE What ? Here. You sure? 
The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t Willard. 
KILGORE (continuing) What's your name, sailor ?

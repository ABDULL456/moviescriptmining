ETHAN Take off your God damn coat! 
He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. 
CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S shivering. 
ETHAN (CONT'D) Where were you? 
CLAIRE I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away. 
ETHAN That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here? 
CLAIRE (slowly) Who is "they?" 
ETHAN Did they send you...Did they send you? 
CLAIRE Who is they, who is they? 
ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. 
ETHAN Who sent you?!  Who sent you? 
CLAIRE (screaming) No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! 
She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN releases his grip on her wrists. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT 
ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. 
CLAIRE Why haven't they brought us in yet? 
ETHAN I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list. 
A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. 
CLAIRE What are you going to do? 
ETHAN I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me. 
CLAIRE Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... 
ETHAN Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me. 
The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. 
THE COMPUTER SCREEN 
Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING."  ETHAN hurries over and clicks on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows up: 
?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. 
?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL 
?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS 
?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH 
CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. 
CLAIRE The message is for Job. 
ETHAN I'm going to answer it. 
EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY 
ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to ETHAN. 
ETHAN Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match? 
Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. 
MATTHIAS Would you remove your hat please?

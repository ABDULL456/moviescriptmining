{"train": "JASON X - Revised Rough Draft \nJASON-X BY TOD FARMER REVISED ROUGH DRAFT MAY 24, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nDARKNESS. \nA scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO - \nMONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths. \nAGAIN, DARKNESS. \nOPEN ON: \nThe year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign. \nBLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM below. \nSmall groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings with strange devices. \nThis is an archeological expedition. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DARK PLACE \nThe dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool to remove the dirt. \nFEMALE VOICE Careful . . . \nMALE VOICE I know. \nThey take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely. \nSTONEY (reading) Not guaranteed, if used After 2198. \nCLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom. \nADRIENNE (smiles) You thinking what I'm thinking? \nStoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThey are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging storm outside and from the raging lust inside. \nBACK INSIDE THE VAN. \nADRIENNE (breathless) What about Kkinsa? \nSTONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra. \nSTONEY It's over between us. You're the only one for me! \nMETAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES! \nThey fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them. \nINT.  DARK CORRIDOR \nA rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover everything. Dead. Lifeless. \nSTONEY You okay? \nAdrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder. \nSHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM. \nWe PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM. \nCUT TO: EXT.  BASE CAMP \nThe digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly. \nFAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of the shuttle ramp. \nFAT LOU (yelling over the wind) Let's go! Time to load up! \nYLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. \nYLLO (yelling) I'm missing two! \nFAT LOU Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago! \nBOEMAN (eyes a device) North three clicks. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MINI-VAN - DAY \nYLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, physical; holds out a device and checks the reading. \nHe points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly. \nBOEMAN (yelling) There! \nKICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic military garb - \nKICKER Yo, Teach, what the fuck? \nYLLO We're missing two of the kids! \nKICKER Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out. \nKICKER moves past the group and into the Van. \nYLLO Not without me! \nThe rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van. \nINT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR \nYLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the ceiling states - \nDELONGPREE Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year. \nADRIENNE Check it out. \nWith a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning - \nA SKULL AND CROSSBONES \nKKINSA So don't open the door. \nADRIENNE Look beyond it, yesterday's news. \nYllo pushes his way to the window. \nShocked faces. \nINSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled up into a ball, is a body - female, young. \nYLLO Is that? \nKAY-EM 14 The room's still operational. She's perfectly preserved. \nYllo's face lights up, grabs his radio. \nYLLO (into radio) Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century! \nKICKER Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door. \nYLLO This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. \nYllo turns to the kids. He's very excited. \nYLLO Okay, no screwing around. This is the real thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, open it up. \nThorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget. \nKKINSA You're opening the door? What about the . . . ? \nShe points to the skull and crossbones. \nDELONGPREE I'm thinking we should call in some experts. \nYLLO This is your find people. You want to give your credit away? \nDELONGPREE I was just saying . . . \nTHORGAN The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. \nKAY-EM 14 Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. \nDELONGPREE Knock you on your ass pal. \nThey don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice crystals crack and fall to the floor. \nEXT.  CRYO CELL \nYLLO Kay-Em! \nKay moves into the room ahead of the others. \nINT.  CRYO CELL \nCLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES \nThey are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body. \n--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up. \nThe other enter the icy chamber. \nDELONGPREE I speak on behalf of the group when I say . . . that's fucked. \nKAY-EM 14 Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick shit house. \nYLLO Thorgan?!!! \nTHORGAN Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back. \nKAY-EM 14 Time of hibernation 2049. Crystallization at seventeen percent. Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent. \nKKINSA What's going on? \nDELONGPREE She's dying. \nJANESSA Bitch looks dead to me. \nThe RADIO CRACKLES . . . \nSERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass back to the shuttle!! \nYLLO Janessa, stretcher. (into radio) Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime. \nSERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Kicker! Get them the hell out of there! \nJanessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground. \nKicker grabs Yllo. \nKICKER We're outta here! \nYllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and -CRACK-breaks it off. \nYLLO Fine, grab that end. \nKicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit - \nTHORGAN Hey check this out! \nProtruding from the door is the tip of a machete. \nTHORGAN This caused the leak and there's an occupant. \nA laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice. \nTHORGAN (reading from device) They're not after us. Their sensors are locked in on . . . him! \nThorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER. \nKICKER Leave him behind! \nYLLO No! He's coming with us! \nThey round a corner . . . \nBOEMAN Here. We're one meter from the surface! \nKICKER Then duck. \nCHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling. \nKABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above. \nDELONGPREE It's too high! \nKicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting! \nKICKER Make it happen! \nJANESSA They're just subclass B droids. I'm so not impressed. \nBOEMAN Stoney, you catch. \nStonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very acrobatic move. \nBoeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall! \nSoon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left. \nBOEMAN We're clear! Let's go! \nBoeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker. \nKicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as spider's cover the floor below them, then - \nA spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's thigh. He screams. \nKICKER They've got me! Let go! \nBOEMAN No! \nBoeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the spiders falling with the pack. \nEXT. SURFACE - DAY \nThe sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman. \nBOEMAN That wasn't so bad. \nKicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole. \nKICKER (yells) This will be! \nThe others dive for the ground as -  - \nKAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole! \nTHORGAN Nice touch. \nBOEMAN And you said high school was boring. \nOur team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle. \nFAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers. \nFAT LOU Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . . \nYLLO Just get us to the ship! \nAzrael stops in a panic! \nAZRAEL Oh shit I forgot my arm! \nADRIENNE Here. Dumbass. \nShe hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp. \nThe door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the sky. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE \nTHE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc. \nINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nNavigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike. \nFAT LOU This is Beowulf approaching from sector fifteen. \nThrough the front windshield we see - - \nGRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old. \nBERNIE(V.O.) I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking. And by the way, Brodski's pissed. \nINT.  DOCKING BAY \nThe shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS standing with weapons at the ready. \nAs the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO. \nBRODSKI What the hell were you thinking? \nYLLO ignores him, turns to his team. \nYLLO Get them in the lab! \nAdrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab. \nLAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S body onto the EXAM TABLE. \nADRIENNE Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside. This is my find! \nShe removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE. \nSTONEY You know even though we both found this guy , I'll let you take the credits. You can take it from here. \nADRIENNE Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another dissection. You'll only get in my way. \nSTONEY Cool. Besides, you're into this shit. \nStoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING. \nINT.  LAB ONE \nYllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and cocky. \nYLLO Hands on training is rare. You should consider yourself lucky. \nAZRAEL Lucky?! \nAzrael sits in a large machine. This is . . . \nThe NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of Nano-Technology. \nAzrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm. \nAZRAEL Another hour and I'd have lost the arm. \nJANESSA Oh, was that the hand you beat off with? \nAZRAEL I better get extra credit for this shit. \nYLLO Delongpree, Status. How you doing? \nDelongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his shoulder. \nDELONGPREE (swallows hard) I'm Okay. \nSTONEY Well she's definitely a blond. \nJANESSA Oh that's scientific. \nDELONGPREE You think all girls from the past looked this good? \nJANESSA She's not that great. \nTHORGAN 400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny. \nYLLO Okay, people, we need to Learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. And if all goes well, I'll mention each one of you when I make my nobel prize speech. \nDELONGPREE (underbreath) Yeah, right. \nDelongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL. \nThorgan checks a monitor. \nTHORGAN Everything looks good. \nYllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction. \nYLLO Turn up the heat. \nAdrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. No hands. \nADRIENNE Done. Crystallization remains seventeen percent. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nAdrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was using in LAB ONE. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification . . . deformity. \nADRIENNE Put it on the screen. \nA monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. \nBack to lab one. \nADRIENNE(V.O.) (over speaker) Guys, check out beef-cakes scan. \nJason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors. \nADRIENNE(V.O.) Look at the brain. \nWithin Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball. \nJANESSA It's just like Thorgan's. What do you think this means? \nThorgan grabs his crotch. \nTHORGAN This is what it means right here. \nJANESSA Small brains make your balls itch? \nDELONGPRE And what's with the headgear? \nKAY-EM 14 The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve. \nBOEMAN Hockey. \nKAY-EM 14 A medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks. Very sexy. \nYLLO What do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources. \nShe eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly. \nKKINSA This bores me. \nDELONGPRE She's red. Body temp 98.6. This is so cool. \nYLLO Prep defib and start the cell reconstruction. \nPEREZ(V.O.) If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here? \nYLLO I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours? \nPEREZ(V.O.) See you then . . . doctor. \nYllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS \nJanessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every word. \nINT.  STONEY'S CABIN \nKkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nCLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE. \nAdrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask. \nINT.  STONEY'S CABIN \nStoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's pants off. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nAdrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm. \nShe stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET. \nShe removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye! \nHolding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station. \nINT.  STONEY'S CABIN \nKkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers in his ear. \nKKINSA How bad do you want it? \nStoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nJASON'S LEG JERKS! \nAdrienne turns again, then approaches. \nADRIENNE Interesting. Record. Thawing has caused possible muscle spasms. \nShe frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body. \nShe moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye. \nThe laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very interesting. \nINT.  STONEY'S CABIN \nStoney lies on top of Kkinsa. \nKKINSA Yes . . . yes . . . that's it! \n. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nJASON sits up! \nCLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser down and turns to the slab and freezes. \nJASON IS GONE! \nShe spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT.  LAB ONE \nDelongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something. \nTHORGAN Anybody seen the reticulator? \nINT.  LAB TWO \nAdrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. \nINT.  LAB ONE \nDELONGPRE Try next door, there was one there yesterday. \nThorgan exits. \nINT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM \nThe lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness. \nTHORGAN Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working. \nThorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass. \nANTE ROOM \nThrough the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass! \nStill screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan looks over his shoulder. \nTHORGAN Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog. \nHe exits. \nBACK TO JASON \nINT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER \nThe others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body. \nYLLO Jesus! \nJANESSA Oh my God! Adrienne? \nTHORGAN What have you done? \nRIZZO What have I done?! Idiots. \nThorgan throws up. \nBOEMAN (into a mike) Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency! \nDELONGPRE Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player? \nRIZZO I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves. \nJANESSA Maybe she tripped. \nBrodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage. \nBRODSKI Jesus, God! \nKICKER Oh man, what the hell happened? \nRIZZO Jason! Can't you see? He did this. \nYLLO Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive. \nRIZZO I didn't say he was alive. \nCUT TO: \nINT.   GRID 52 \nAzrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights STROBE. \nHe's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder. \nSTALKING POV \nSomething watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker closes in. \nSuddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us. \nHIS POV \nA HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES. \nSitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow. \nSUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then -- \nFZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO REVEAL-- \nDALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier. \nDALLAS That's nine to four, geek-boy. \nAZRAEL You got lucky. \nDALLAS You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head. \nAZRAEL Speaking of which, duck! \nDallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet, take aim, when -- \nONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF! \nGREEN GOO squirts from its body. \nAZRAEL What the?! \nJASON VOORHEES \nSLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle. Then another. \nDALLAS He's good. \nAzrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror. \nTHeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever. \nDALLAS That sucks. Why won't he go down? \nAZRAEL Pause play. \nSuddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to Dallas and Azrael. \nDALLAS He's not part of the program. \nAZRAEL Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. \nJason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched whistle. \nWhy aren't they running. \nAZRAEL Hey! We're playing a game here. Get off the court! \nJason raises his silver blade high. \nDALLAS No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts... \nSLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage. Blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed. \nAZRAEL Asshole that does not count as a kill. \nDALLAS Yes it does. \nAZRAEL Oh, come on! \nJASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks. \nWIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything. \nSven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod. \nSVEN Oh shit. \nFrom inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights. \nKicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his lunch. \nSVEN Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out. \nBRODSKI (over radio) Dead? \nSVEN Oh yeah. \nKicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend. KICKER (into radio) Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got it to. Real slice and dice. What should we do? \nINT.  LAB TWO \nEveryone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro. \nBRODSKI Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt. \nKICKER IN THE GRID \nKICKER Roger that. (to himself) Time to kick some ass! \nFrom behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the darkness. \nKICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready! \nIT'S SVEN! \nSVEN Sorry! \nKICKER Don't friggen do that! \nINT.  LAB TWO \nBrodski is in assault mode. \nBRODSKI Yllo, what's your head count? \nYLLO Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa. \nJANESSA You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that? \nBrodski scans the room - a tactical assessment. \nBRODSKI This place should be safe. Get them back here. I don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. As much as I've dreamed of doing that. \nBrodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin. \nBRODSKI I need to know what you know about this guy. \nRIZZO Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it. \nBRODSKI Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. \nRizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy. \nBRODSKI I've been a grunt for fifteen years. There's not a problem I can't fix with enough ammunition. \nYllo is getting no response. \nYLLO Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately! (beat) I'm going to see if I can find them. \nYllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp. \nKkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over to her with a blanket. \nKKINSA Sstoney's dead! \nThey all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo puts her head in her hands...not again. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nBrodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall. \nYLLO ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends. \nBRODSKI Not a chance. \nYLLO JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. \nBRODSKI You got that right. \nThey arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM. \nYLLO This thing could be worth a great deal.... scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with you 50/50... \nThe door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind. \nBRODSKI You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!! \nKICKER Fuckin A... \nBRODSKI Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do! \nINT.  LAB ONE \nYllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to do. \nYLLO That bastard! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors. \nRizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her. \nRIZZO Robot huh? \nKAY-EM 14 Kay-em 14. \nRIZZO Barbie from hell... \nKAY-EM 14 Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six... \nRIZZO tNighty-night. \nJanessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman stands, blocks his path. \nCRUTCH Leave her be. \nRIZZO Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat? \nThorgan timidly raises his hand. \nRIZZO Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me. \nTHORGAN Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. \nRizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall. \nRIZZO How do you open the damn door? \nYLLO You're crazy! \nKkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open. \nDELONGPRE Rizzo, he's out there. \nRIZZO Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. (looks at Delongpre) Last chance. \nThe others stare at her. She's crazy. \nRIZZO Fine. Bye. \nShe and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them. \nYLLO (favoring his nose) Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour. The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it. \nBut the kids aren't so sure. \nINT.  LAB TWO \nYllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console. \nYLLO Computer on line. \nA series of beeps. \nJANESSA(O.S.) What are you doing? \nYLLO (jumps) Jesus! Can't you knock? (back to console) Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Power to Beowulf disengaged. \nYLLO (to Janessa) She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GRENDEL BRIDGE \nFat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections. \nFAT LOU Disengage auto-pilot. \nBERNIE Disengaged. \nFAT LOU New COURSE, seven-eighty-one. \nEXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV \nShe banks slowly to the right. \nINT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE \nBERNIE On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds. \nFAT LOU Engage auto pilot. \nSuddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through the console as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish. \nBERNIE En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta... \nFat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop of her. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nFAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has legs. Little good they'll do him. \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD. \nFar in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB. A monitor reads ... \nSPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CARGO BAY \nRizzon and Kkinsa enter. \nRIZZO Which way? \nKkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops. \nKKINSA What? \nRIZZO Ssh. \nRizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates. \nRIZZO He's in here. \nKkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's mouth. \nRIZZO You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it? \nKkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her. \nKKINSA (whispers) How do you know? \nTHORGAN Jesus, tell this asshole I don't play hockey! \nCRUTCH Okay! \nOur group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space. \nYLLO Will that take us to the bridge? \nCRUTCH It's a maze up there, but yes. \nYLLO We'll engage auto-pilot! Everything'll be fine! \nWith that, the door gives! \nBoeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason pauses, staring at Kay-Em -- \nKAY-EM 14 Heart beat irregular...no blood flow... impossible...this....this... does not make sense. \nJason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and leaps through the hole in the celing. \nINT.  CEILING WALK SPACE \nYllo grips the ledge. \nYLLO Move it people! \nThen Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms. \nBOEMAN Help me! \nDeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily. \nINT.  LAB ONE \nYllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him. \nYLLO Now hold on! Have you considered how valuable you are? Credit, fame, you can have it all. And ladies. I mean, how long has it been? \nJason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete sticking through Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall. \nJason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He drops the cleaver to the ground. \nYLLO (chuckles) That's all you wanted? \nINT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY \nThe shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset -- \nYLLO(V.O.) It's okay, he just wanted his machete. \nRIZZO (knowingly) Three...two...one... \nYllo screams. \nINT.  CEILING WALK SPACE \nYllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the walkway, then -- \nYLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP! \nKAY-EM 14 Now that's just gross. \nJASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS. \nDELONGPRE GO, GO, GO! \nThey race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical wires, Crutch in the lead. \nINT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY \nKkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo. \nKKINSA Rizzo, come on! \nBut, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the headset. \nTHORGAN(V.O.) Go-go-go-go-go!!!! \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) He's right behind us! \nRIZZO Damn! (to Kkinsa) Close the door! I'll be right back. \nKKINSA (panicked) What?!! \nRIZZO I gotta go back. \nKKINSA But?!! \nRizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving Kkinsa nearly insane. \nINT.  CELING WALK SPACE \nKAY-EM 14 I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this. \nCrutch comes to a fork in the walkway. \nCRUTCH Okay, we need to ... \nBOEMAN You forgot didn't you, you old fart? \nAt the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind him. \nDELONGPRE Shit! Move it! He's coming! \nDelongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan \nDELONGPRE Go! \nRacing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping over and under and through whatever blocks the path. \nDELONGPRE Faster! \nJason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him. \nDELONGPRE FASTER!!! \nJanessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the first time in 400 hundred years. \nIt's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his feet and races towards her. \nRIZZO Don't just stand there! Shoot him! \nDELONGPRE (to Jason) No you don't! \nBRAAAAAAATTTT! \nThe chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one of the cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS. \nRIZZO Don't stop! \nShe jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate. \nRIZZO You never stop when he's down! \nBut the crate is empty. \nRIZZO Shit!!!! \nThey spin around, searching. \nCRUTCH (weak) Forget him. Come on. \nCarrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay. \nINT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY \npanel, clicks some buttons, then -- \nBOEMAN Uh-oh. \nJANESSA What?! \nBOEMAN Kkinsa! Open the doors! \nINT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nKkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified. \nBOEMAN(V.O.) Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors! \nINT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY \nDeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way. \nDELONGPRE Kkinsa, open the goddamn door! \nRIZZO Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work. \nINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nRIZZO(V.O.) (calming) Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not out here right now, so please let us in. \nKkinsa doesn't move. \nRIZZO(V.O.) Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die. \nINT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY \nDELONGPRE Med-kit? \nRIZZO I guessed. \nINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nKkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE DOORS...hesitates. \nRIZZO(V.O.) We're going to be okay, Kkinsa. Just relax. \nINT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY \nKay-Em 14 steps forward. \nKAY-EM 14 Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects of the human psyche. \nRizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ... \nKAY-EM 14 Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14... open the fucking door you silly bitch! \nRizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way. \nKAY-EM 14 I didn't say I was good at it. \nINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nTHORGAN(V.O.) Oh shit! There he is! \nINT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE \nJason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay. \nINT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT \nKkinsa leans forward and presses -- \nLAUNCH. \nINT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY \nThe Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship. \nBOEMAN Kkinsa! No!!! \nEXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV \nThe shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position. \nINT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY \nRizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBut Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he rushes after them. \nINT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE \nCOMPUTER VOICE Dam-damage port side 59 percent. Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors failing. \nINT.  CARGO BAY \nOur kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them -- \nThorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly. The door won't open. \nTHORGAN Oh shit. \nThey turn as Jason looms toward them, then -- \nEVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT \nCargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason. \nThe loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into the cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards. \nJANESSA This is just great. \nKAY-EM 14 Engage magnetics. \nKay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the back of the head. \nStill holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of frame. \nThe force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction. \nTHORGAN This is crazy, we can't do anything like this! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the ceiling. \nA SEVERED ARM \nfloats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand. Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason. \nBRAAATTTT... \nJason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS Delongpre into a back wall. He's knocked unconcious. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck. \nTHORGAN Grab my hand! \nJanessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious dELONGPRE'S FOOT. \nJANESSA Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre? We'll push you in. \nCARGO - MIDSHIP \nJason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay, unable to stop himself. \nBOEMAN \nreaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the locks of his hair, pulls himself closer. \nDELONGPRE Hey! That hurts. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nRizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a hanging piece of busted catwalk. \nDELONGPRE (to Rizzo) Push off toward us. \nJANESSA Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there. \nCrutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his open gut, tangling around our heroes. \nTHORGAN I'm gonna spew. \nJANESSA That ought'a help the situation. \nDELONGPRE Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you. \nRIZZO'S POV \nRizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, Boeman, and Delongpre. \nRIZZO What if you miss? \nDELONGPRE What if we don't? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then pushes off with his feet. \nHE ROCKETS toward her! \nDELONGPRE He's coming right at you! \nRizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED... and bad. She's gonna miss them. \nBoeman flips in the air! \nBOEMAN (to Delongpre) Grab my feet! \nDelongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum spins the human chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart. \nJANESSA Okay that hurt. \nBOEMAN Thorgan, pull us in. \nJason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall -- \nJanessa stares at him. \nJANESSA What's the point? \nDelongpre shrugs. \nDELONGPRE So that's it then. \nIt seems it is. \nJanessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from the ship's hull. \nRIZZO What's that? \nBOEMAN THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. \nKAY-EM 14 No... (signing) That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang. \nRIZZO Are there any other shuttles? \nJANESSA No. \nRIZZO Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? \nTHORGAN You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you? \nJANESSA A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it? \nKAY-EM 14 I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn. \nTHORGAN Am I in there? \nKAY-EM 14 Sory... \nRIZZO Hey. \nDELONGPRE That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good. \nRIZZO Hey!! \nAll heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull. \nRIZZO What's this? \nDELONGPRE It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom. \nRizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls. \nRIZZO Can we get through these? \nTHORGAN Sure but what good will that do? \nBOEMAN When the left hull goes, so will the right. \nRIZZO What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? \nThey stare at her. \nJANESSA You know, Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions. \nThe others stare at her as if she were crazy. \nRIZZO Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. \nJANESSA I'm just saying. \nRIZZO (to others) Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways? \nDELONGPRE We'd need charges. \nBOEMAN We could convert fission transistors. \nTHORGAN We're not supposed to do that. \nBOEMAN What are you gonna do, tell me? \nDELONGPRE The engine room will have molecular welders. We could seal up the hull. \nA moment of consideration. Could this actually work? \nJANESSA YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job. \nTHORGAN Would you? \nKAY-EM 14 Now this is getting exciting. \nDELONGPRE Remember to roll his balls around a bit. \nRIZZO You got a better plan? \nObviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet. \nBOEMAN I'll need system four converters. \nTHORGAN They're back here. \nDELONGPRE How many? \nBOEMAN Bring 'em all. Let's move! \nThorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine. \nTHORGAN Hey! I'm not ready. \nBOEMAN Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there. \nJANESSA You're so bossy. \nTHORGAN You're leaving me here alone? \nDelongpre tosses the chaingun next to him. \nDELONGPRE Don't blow your foot off. \nThey climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear. \nRIZZO(O.S.) Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going. \nINT.  WALKWAY THREE \nDELONGPRE Were you close to your father? \nThorgan interrupts over the headset. \nTHORGAN(V.O.) Delongpre? What did you do with the chain gun? \nDelongpre frowns. \nDELONGPRE (into mike) It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up! \nTHORGAN(V.O.) I'm on my way. \nBOEMAN(V.O.) Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on! \nTHORGAN(V.O.) I'm coming, I'm coming. \nDELONGPRE Sorry, you were saying? \nINT. CARGO BAY \nWATCHER'S POV \nJANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried. \nRIZZO(O.S.) I got along great with my father, my mother too. Dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years. \nJanessa moves the debris around with her foot. \nRIZZO(O.S.) They were all wrong. They couldn't control him. \nINT. WALKWAY THREE \nDELONGPRE And what happend to ...? \nRizzo begins to tear up. \nRIZZO I couldn't save them. \nDELONGPRE Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you? \nShe stares at him. \nDELONGPRE It's true. (chuckles) You caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. Of course this is the first field trip I went on that had a body count. \nShe gives him a  half smile. \nDELONGPRE I'm not much, but I promise, I won't let this guy get you. \nAnother half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really do? \nINT. CARGO BAY \nJASON'S POV \nHe watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward her. \nShe stands and turns as -- \nSERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her! \nShe SCREAMS. \nHe's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut. \nBRODSKI Where is everybody? What happened? \nJANESSA Damnit! You scared the hell out of me! \nBRODSKI Give me a break! What happened? \nJANESSA Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab. \nBRODSKI Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo. \nJANESSA Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too. \nBRODSKI Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down. \nKA-THUNK! \nJASON\"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around and tosses him to the floor! \nBRODSKI Yup, that ought'a do it. \nJason turns on Janessa. \nShe stands frozen in fear. \nJason raises his machete and -- \nJANESSA \nLights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino syringe into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there staring at her. \nJANESSA Well go on! Pass out! \nJason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside. \nJANESSA Shit. \nJason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run. \nBRODSKI (weak) He-help me... \nHe holds his hand out to her. Then-- \nBOEMAN(V.O.) I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on. \nKA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS! \nJanessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind. \nBRATTTT!!! \nKay-Em blows Jason into -- \nINT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO \nShe kicks him down the long corridor. \nINT. WALKWAY TWO \nThe hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES. \nBOEMAN I'd say we have about ten minutes tops. \nDELONGPRE Then stop talking and work faster! \nINT.  LAB ONE \nJason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab! Kay-Em enters behind him. \nKAY-EM 14 (still singing) She was a young and charming girl; her age was scarce sixteen. \nJASON rushes KAY-EM 14! \nKAY-EM 14 She took me in and she kicked out a sailor and marine. \nKA-CHING!!!! \nHis machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor. \nKAY-EM 14 She had no titties on her chest; that didn't bother me, \nWHAM! \nKay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him. \nKAY-EM 14 For what she had between her legs was big enough for three. \nINT. WALKWAY TWO \nBoeman and Delongpre are finishing up. \nBOEMAN Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge. \nJanessa looks around, then -- \nJANESSA I...I don't know what I did... \nDELONGPRE You lost the charge? \nJANESSA He was chasing me! \nRIZZO Can we blow it with just two? \nBOEMAN If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her. \nDELONGPRE Then what do we do?! \nBOEMAN I don't know! \nINT.  LAB ONE \nKay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is in bad shape. But still climbs to his feet...slowly. \nKAY-EM 14 Why you low life, scum sucking, rat dick blowing, sum bitch. Your mamma must'a had some huge balls. \nOf course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother. \nJason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. Glass, formaldehyde and specimens rain down on top of them. \nHaving lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and OVER. He catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below. \nINT. WALKWAY TWO \nDELONGPRE Well, it was a good plan. \nThey look at one another -- hopless. Then -- \nBRODSKI(O.S.) You stupid bitch! \nEveryone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame. He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his mid-section. \nBRODSKI Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die! \nBOEMAN Sergeant? We thought you were... \nBRODSKI Yeah, yeah. (to Janessa) Well, what have you got to say for yourself? \nJANESSA I don't know...sorry? \nRIZZO Sergeant, we could use a big bomb. \nBRODSKI Bomb? \nBOEMAN Explosive. We're blowing the walkway. \nThe sergeant tosses his pack to the ground. \nBRODSKI How much you need? \nINT. LAB ONE \nWHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the future. \nFinally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until \nKAY-EM 14 (condescending) That was very good. You should feel very good about yourself right now. Good effort. (tough voice) How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?! \nKay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest. \nBRAAAATTTT!!!! \nJason is blown across the room! \nKAY-EM 14 Okay, dip shit. Time to finish you off so I can go home and boink your momma with a corndog. The kinky bitch. \nON OUR HEROES \nSuddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them. \nThe group stops and turns. \nThe cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens. \nBRODSKI Well fuck me. \nKAY-EM 14 No, fuck me. \nThe door opens and Jason steps into the walkway. \nBut he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is CHROME. We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than ever. \nTHORGAN Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct. \nKAY-EM 14 Yeeee-haw!!!! \nBRAAAATTTTT! \nKay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs. \nJason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, removing a hunk of metal. \nJason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS. One of the wires, connecting two charges severs. \nBOEMAN Shit! \nKay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved backwards. \nBoeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues. \nIT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic killer. SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but Jason uses his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee. \nShe stumbles...falls to the ground. \nTHORGAN Kay-Em!!! \nBoeman splices the wires together. \nBOEMAN Done!! \nThen turns to see Jason approaching. \nBOEMAN RUN!! \nBut Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman. \nON KAY-EM \nAs her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH! THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs. \nAs Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in -- \nKA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free. \nJason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again. \nCHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, over Jason's head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's no match. Finally -- \nJASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his fist from Kay-Em's chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat. \nTHORGAN Kay-Em! Get away! \nThorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him down the hall. \nKAY-EM 14 That's the best you can do? \nJason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her head from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids. \nKAY-EM 14 Is that it? Come back and fight like a man! \nJASON \nTurns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end. \nDELONGPRE \nDELONGPRE Done! \nDelongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees JASON. \nDELONGPRE Shit, hurry! \nOUR HEROES \nRun toward the door. But, Thorgan stops. \nBOEMAN What...? \nThorgan turns, runs back toward Jason. \nBOEMAN What are you doing?!! \nThorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and Jason. He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the head. \nKAY-EM 14 I think I'm going to throw up... \nBUT IT'S TOO LATE. \nJason raises his machete from his belt and -- \nRIZZO(O.S.) Hey, dickhead! \nJASON TURNS AS -- \nKA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar. \nRIZZO (to Thorgan) Go! \nNo, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something foreign. The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a camp. But the image will do. QUICK CUT TO: \nINT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY \nThorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space suit. He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his. \nAt the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion. \nTHORGAN Don't worry. He can't see us. \nRizzo glances out the docking bay window. \nRIZZO Is that...? \nTHROUGH WINDSHIELD \nWe see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are wrong. \nDELONGPRE Earth II. \nBOEMAN(V.O.) Suit up. \nDelongpre leads Rizzo to a suit. \nDELONGPRE I'll help you in. \nTHORGAN (into headset) Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nKay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room. \nKAY-EM 14 It was my pleasure, my love. Perhaps if all works for the best you can rebuild me and we can try that doggie style thing again. \nDOCKING BAY \nThe others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least. \nDELONGPRE I knew you were a little sick, but Geez. \nON KAY-EM \nKAY-EM 14 (singing happily) I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you. \nTHORGAN (under his breath) Goodbye, my love. \nBOEMAN(V.O.) Thorgan, suit up. \nTHORGAN (to Rizzo) This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program? \nRIZZO His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work. \nDELONGPRE That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit. \nRIZZO Eat me. \nShe smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nJason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14. \nQUICK-CUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE \nJason is walking along the lake when he sees -- \nA CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING. CAMPERS!!! \nHe takes off toward the campfire, then hears -- \nSPLASHING. \nHe turns. \nHIS POV \nWithin the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little boy? A little Jason from many years ago? \nWOMAN Help me! (gurgles) Jason help me! \nJASON \nMoves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water. \nHIS POV \nTHE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER! \nHe turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then -- \nJASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER. \nMRS. VOORHEES Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother! \nJason moves closer. \nMRS. VOORHEES Don't let me die again! \nAs he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him. \nJASON \nPauses staring at the please for help. \nHe stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years! \nHe places his hand over her face, gently, then -- \nPUSHES HER UNDER! \nHe holds her there. \nQUICK-CUT TO: \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Don't worry. He can't get through that door. \nDelongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors. \nBOEMAN(V.O.) Thrusters. \nCHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH. \nOur group enters deep space. \nEXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL \nRizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive right hull. They thrust slowly into space. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, you okay? \nRIZZO(V.O.) No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing! \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember? \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. DOCKING BAY \nJason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back. Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at -- \nTHE DOOR PANEL \nHe preses the button \nthe ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the room! \nSergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down races out along with him. \nON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD \nAS it skitters across the floor -- \nKAY-EM 14 Ahhhhh! \n-- and right out the air lock \nJASON \nholds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go! He shoots out into space. \nEXT. GRENDEL \nJason flies out of the air lock. \nHIS POV \nHe's rocketing right toward one of the space suits! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time? \nRIZZO(V.O.) I think I had some when I was eight. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Did you like it? \nRIZZO(V.O.) I think so, why? \nTHORGAN(V.O.) He's trying to ask you out on a date. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Shut up, Thorgan! \nRIZZO(V.O.) Delongpre, you don't even know me. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) I know you. \nSuddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away from the others. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Nooooooo!! \nRIZZO \ngrapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG. \nJason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. He's going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her head, when -- \nWHAM! \nDelongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling. \nDelongpre clings to Jason's back. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, pull away! \nRIZZO(V.O.) I'm stuck! \nJason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until he's holding Delongpre around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass... \nTHORGAN(V.O.) We're too far away! \nBACK TO JASON \nAS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back. \nRIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear Delongpre CHOKING over the radio. \nThe three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II. \nThen, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button on her sleeve. \nKA-CHSSHSH!!! \nHER AIR TANK BLOWS! \nJASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM! \n", "test1_input": "Jason keeps coming. \nShe runs. \nAs she rounds a corner, we  see - - \nCRYOGENICS LAB \nShe opens the door and enters the cold room.

Jason slides backwards on the slick floor. \nKABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. \nKABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit. \nRizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON INSIDE. \nRIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad. \nSteam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Cryo-Unit activated. \nSlowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches slowly, staring at the fogging glass - \nKA-CHING! \nThe MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder! \nALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress. Security measures on line. \nRIZZO Nooooooo! \nShe rushes toward the door. It won't budge. \nRIZZO Somebody! No! \nCHSHSHSHSHSH! \nGas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Subject in computer unit has reached full incubation. \nRizzo begins to fade.

Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose. \nDELONGPRE Spunky . . . \nYLLO She broke my fucking nose! \nKAY-EM 14 Again proving that your ancestors were savages. \nBRODSKI I like her already. \nKAY-EM 14 Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - \nRizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her. \nRIZZO Where..? Who . . .? (shock) I'm alive. You brought me back. \nYLLO (rubbing his nose) Obviously so. \nRizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh. \nRIZZO What the hell is this shit? \nDelongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself. \nRIZZO How did I get here, how did you bring me back? \nYLLO Nanotechnology. \nRIZZO Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible. \nYLLO We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years. \nRIZZO 30? How long was I out? \nRizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong in her world. \n", "test1_true": "Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation. \nYLLO Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions... \nRIZZO JASON?!

LAB FOUR \nRizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is quite beautiful. \nDELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo? \nRizzo is startled. She looks around. \nRIZZO Yeah? \nDelongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. \nDELONGPRE I thought that after 400 hundred years, you just might have a little bit of an appetite. \nHe puts the food on a small table and moves to the window. \nDELONGPRE You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran transport. It's basically a school bus. We're on our way back to Earth II. It's finals week. \nShe turns back to the window. \nRIZZO You're telling me I'm a friggen class project? \nDelongpre flinches, expecting to be hit. \nDELONGPRE (a beat) Sort of. I mean, no, not really ... \nShe collapses onto the bed. \nDELONGPRE I'll give you a moment alone. Do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection? \nRizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years. \nDelongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him. \nRizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry. \nINT.  LAB ONE \nAs Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him. \nYLLO Well? \nDELONGPRE She needs a little time. \nYLLO More time...shit, she's had 400 years... \nYllo laughs at his own joke. \nDELONGPRE That's really funny. \nYLLO I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women. \nDELONGPRE Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through? \nRIZZO(O.S.) Dissection? \nTheyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo. \nRIZZO Jason? He's on this ship?! \nYLLO Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity. \nRIZZO (glares) Are you finished? \nYllo nods then -- \nWHAM! \nRizzo punches him again. \nYLLO God damnit! Will you stop doing that?! \nDELONGPRE Oh I like her a lot. \nBRODSKI I'm with you kid. \nRIZZO Where is he? \nBRODSKI (points) Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead. \nRIZZO No, you're dead!

Jason slides backwards on the slick floor. \nKABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. \nKABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit. \nRizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON INSIDE. \nRIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad. \nSteam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently. \nCOMPUTER VOICE Cryo-Unit activated. \nSlowly the unit goes silent, still.

Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose. \nDELONGPRE Spunky . . . \nYLLO She broke my fucking nose! \nKAY-EM 14 Again proving that your ancestors were savages. \nBRODSKI I like her already. \nKAY-EM 14 Live signs full strength.

You brought me back. \nYLLO (rubbing his nose) Obviously so. \nRizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh. \nRIZZO What the hell is this shit? \nDelongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself. \nRIZZO How did I get here, how did you bring me back? \nYLLO Nanotechnology. \nRIZZO Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible. \nYLLO We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years. \nRIZZO 30?

It's basically a school bus. We're on our way back to Earth II. It's finals week. \nShe turns back to the window. \nRIZZO You're telling me I'm a friggen class project? \nDelongpre flinches, expecting to be hit. \nDELONGPRE (a beat) Sort of. I mean, no, not really ... \nShe collapses onto the bed. \nDELONGPRE I'll give you a moment alone. Do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection? \nRizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years. \nDelongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him. \nRizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry. \nINT.

Jesus, women. \nDELONGPRE Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through? \nRIZZO(O.S.) Dissection? \nTheyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo. \nRIZZO Jason? He's on this ship?! \nYLLO Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity. \nRIZZO (glares) Are you finished? \nYllo nods then -- \nWHAM! \nRizzo punches him again. \nYLLO God damnit! Will you stop doing that?! \nDELONGPRE Oh I like her a lot. \nBRODSKI I'm with you kid. \nRIZZO Where is he? \nBRODSKI (points) Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead. \nRIZZO No, you're dead!

You stupid bitch! \nEveryone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.

We thought you were... \nBRODSKI Yeah, yeah.

Mao Tse Tung's presence is charismatic.  His delivery is powerful - simple, yet firm.  He is spellbinding. 
MAO TSE TUNG The mission of China is to bring progress to Tibet.  Develop its natural resources.  Help its people develop democracy. We welcome you, Tibet, back to the Motherland! 
INT.  DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, CHINESE GUEST HOUSE  NIGHT 
Tenzin Gyatso snoops around this room.  He opens drawers, cabinets, just as a child would.  He finds odd little pieces of ceramics, pens, paper. 
He moves to the bathroom, runs a bath.  Hot water. Electricity.  This is the modern world. 
INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  DAY 
The Dalai Lama sits beside Chairman Mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces.  Mao offers His Holiness a plate of Chinese delicacies. 
We notice that Mao's clothes are shabby and old. (His suit is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey-drab). His cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn.  But, his shoes, are beautifully polished. 
He has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny. 
Later, Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama sit across from one another. 
Tenzin Gyatso takes notes as Mao speaks. 
MAO TSE TUNG I am so glad that Tibet has come back to the Motherland. 
Tenzin Gyatso quietly sips his tea. 
MAO TSE TUNG You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation. 
MAO TSE TUNG It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement.  We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet.  The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary. 
Mao speaks and moves very slowly.  He pants and wheezes.  He appears to be sick.  Tenzin Gyatso takes notes. 
TENZIN GYATSO I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao.  I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay. 
MAO TSE TUNG Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country.  A a wonderful history.  Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you.  In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China. 
Tenzin Gyatso writes in his notebook. 
MAO TSE TUNG You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha.  He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption.  Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix. 
TENZIN GYATSO For me, I think such a mix is crucial. 
MAO TSE TUNG Have a sweet. Made in my home province.  The kind my mother used to make. 
The Dalai Lama accepts. 
EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso does physical exercise with a few Chinese Bodyguards. 
EXT.  GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE  DAY 
Tenzin Gyatso studies with Ling Rinpoche. The Lord Chamberlain sits with them. 
TENZIN GYATSO "If moral discipline is learned from the beginning, one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth.  A staircase for achieving liberation.  An antidote eliminating misery and sorrow.  Without discipline there is no method." 
Pause. 
TENZIN GYATSO I am thinking of becoming a Communist Party Member. I like what I see of Marxism.  It is based on equality and justice for all. I believe Chairman Mao wishes the best for our people.  Our path must be non-violence.  Co-operation. 
The Lord Chamberlain simply looks at the young man.  He has nothing to say. 
INT.  MAO'S OFFICE  NIGHT 
There is a knock and Tenzin Gyatso is led into the room. 
Mao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily. 
MAO TSE TUNG Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late. 
TENZIN GYATSO I leave tomorrow. 
MAO TSE TUNG Yes, I am aware.  How has your time in China been? 
Tenzin Gyatso sits. He takes out his book and pen, ready to take notes. 
TENZIN GYATSO I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments.  Industrial progress.  Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous. 
MAO TSE TUNG You have a lot to learn about organization.  How to draw out people's opinions.  How to make key decisions.  Train your young Tibetans.  When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan. 
DALAI LAMA Always. 
Tenzin Gyatso records Mao's words. 
MAO TSE TUNG Your attitude is good, you know. I understand you well. But you need to learn this: religion is poison. It undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people.  Tibet has been poisoned by religion.

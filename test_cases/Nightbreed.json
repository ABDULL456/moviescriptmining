Peloquin is at the gate, when Kinski comes up behind and restrains him. \nKINSKI: He's gone, give it up! You don't dare go out there! \nPeloquin stares at Boone through the gate. Panting, sweating, Boone stares back. Snorting with frustration, Peloquin recedes, he and Kinski disappear into shadow. \nBoone heaves a sigh of relief, turns from the gate and trudges away into the darkness, when suddenly . . . \n71. EXT. OUTSIDE NECROPOLIS GATES NIGHT \nHarsh lights hit Boone from every side; police cars in the reeds all around, their searchlights focused on him. Two dozen cops, all levelling firearms. \nJOYCE: Freeze! Right there! \nBoone squints against the glare. \nJOYCE [cont.]: Aaron Boone, you're under arrest. Hands on your head! \nNOW! \nBoone takes a step back. The wound on his neck throbs and swells. At the edge of the light, Decker appears, stepping towards him. \nDECKER: Boone, listen to him, it's no use! \nJOYCE [to Decker]: Stay back! \nDECKER [lowers his voice]: Lieutenant, I can bring him out. He'll listen to me. \nJoyce ponders, then signals him forward.

They enter a smaller room. Burton flips a switch. Curtains part in front of a thick glass panel, revealing a small, sterile viewing chamber. \nIn the chamber are a morgue attendant and, lying on a stainless steel table, Boone's body. Lori looks at the body with heartbreaking sadness. She nods. Burton closes the curtains. Lori and Joyce exit. On the other side of the glass, the attendant rolls Boone on the table towards a door marked 'Pathology'. \n79. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT \nDr Decker sits alone, looking into his briefcase. The door opens, Lori and Joyce enter. Decker closes the briefcase, rises, aggrieved, takes both of Lori's hands in his, speaks soothingly. \nDECKER: Lori, I'm Dr Decker. Boone was my patient. \nLORI: Yes. Hello. \nDECKER: I'm so sorry for your loss. I must tell you, you meant the world to Aaron. He spoke of you constantly ... \nLORI [withdrawing her hand - has the creeps]: Thank you, Doctor. \nLori sits across a table from Joyce. Decker sits against the wall. \nJOYCE: Miss Winston, are you sure you wouldn't rather postpone... \nLORI: No. Let's get it over with. \nJoyce turns on a tape recorder on the table. \nJOYCE [starting at the beginning]: What was your relationship with Aaron Boone? \nLORI [pause]: We were lovers. \nWe move in on the revolving reels of the tape recorder. \nJOYCE: How long had you known Aaron Boone? \nLORI: Two months. \n80.

They weren't takin' any chances. \nBurton picks up a small digging tool and zeroes in on one of the chest wounds. \nBURTON: Wound number one: entered between the fourth and fifth left ribs, impacted the lower rib, lodging in ligaments adjacent to the left lung ... \nHe digs. \n81. INT. INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT \nJOYCE: So he never gave any indication ... \nLORI: No ... \nJOYCE: Surely there must have been something ... \nLORI [firm, angry]; Look, you can say whatever you want to about him. I don't believe it. He never raised a hand to me, he never harmed anyone in his life. \nA strained silence. Decker drums his fingers on his briefcase. \nDECKER: Miss Winston, everyone has their secret faces ... \nLORI: Drop dead. \nAnnoyed at Decker, Joyce turns off the tape recorder. \nJOYCE: We'll continue this some other time. \nLori stands and heads for the door. \n82.

MOTEL BAR NIGHT \nA wood-panelled, Western Frontier-themed bar. Country music. A banner welcomes rodeo participants. A number of rough types clustered at tables, many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with buffalo horns. Lori enters, looks around. A cowboy lassoes a waitress, ropes her in to general applause. Lori takes a seat at the bar and is approached by a bartender. \nBARTENDER: What'll it be, darlin'? \nLORI: A draft and some information please. \nBARTENDER [taps a stein of draft]: There's the draft. \nLORI [lays down a bill]: I'm looking for a town called Midian. \nBARTENDER: You're not the first. \nLORI: No? \nBARTENDER: Had a bunch of TV news folks passin' through, since they nailed that baby-slasher up there. \nLORI: Baby-slasher? \nBARTENDER: Yeah, hell of a week for us. The rodeo this weekend. That scumbag gets blown away. I hear it took thirty slugs to bag that sucker. Just goes to show you, don't it? People love a spectacle. \nLori's hit with a burst of emotion.

MOTEL BATHROOM DAY \nLori enters and leans on the sink as the grief hits her. She sobs. A stall door opens behind her: Sheryl, a girl in her early twenties, exits. \nLori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself, standing back to allow Sheryl access to the mirror, where she studied herself before starting to tease her hair. \nSHERYL: Which is it, hon', men or money? [Lori looks at her] It's usually one or the other, ain't it? \nLORI: Oh...[a tiny smile]...A man. \nSHERYL: Uh-huh. What'd he do, leave? \nLORI: Not exactly. \nSHERYL: Jesus, did he come back?

Sheryl's into her fourth Black Russian and is getting friendlier by the moment. \nSHERYL [pause - just heard the story]: Lord. I have seen men go to great lengths to walk out on a girl. But, I must say, I have never heard tell of a fella doin' it while deceased. \nLORI: They think some sick bastard's stole the body. \nSHERYL: So you want to go check out the place in which he checked out? \nLORI: Yeah. Guess it's a way to say goodbye, you know? He was always a mystery to me. I loved him...[she looks away] \nSHERYL: Tell you what, Lori, why don't I drive up there to this Medium place with you tomorrow and keep you company? \nLORI: You don't have to do that. \nSHERYL: Yeah, but I'm goin' to and I don't want no argument from you. \nLORI [smiles, grateful]: Okay. Thanks. \nSHERYL: That's all right. \nLORI [finishes her beer]: Guess I'll head up to my room. \nSHERYL: You get some rest, sugar. I'm gonna stay down here and close this damn bar. Maybe one of these lunkheads'll win the lottery. \nLori smiles, squeezes her hand, exits the bar. Sheryl looks around, finishes her drink. The bartender sets another drink down in front of her. \nBARTENDER: Courtesy of that gent in the suit at the end of the bar. \nSheryl looks down the bar, sees the man, seems impressed, waves. \nSHERYL [low, to the bartender]: Isn't he just the picture of sophistication though? \n96A. EXT. NECROPOLIS NIGHT \nWe Cut to a wide shot of the Necropolis by night. A shooting star falls. \nNow we move in on one of the mausoleums, and from the ground below we hear a ritualistic chanting. \nOnce within the darkness of the mausoleum the camera slides down over the rock face into the depths of Midian. The volume of the chanting increases as we come close to its source. \n96B. INT. MURAL CHAMBER \nWe come into the mural chamber, the camera passing down over the family tree of Naturals and Nightbreed and round to see Rachel and Kinski approaching and entering the door of the initiation chamber. \nCut to Narcisse and Boone, also approaching the chamber. \nNARCISSE: You'll like this. No, really. It's just their way of welcoming you to the club. \nBOONE: I'm not sure I want to be a member. \nNARCISSE: You made your way back here for the same reasons I did. We belong here now. There's nowhere else on earth would take us in. \nCUT TO: \n96C. INT. INITIATION CHAMBER \nIn the middle of the chamber is a kind of font, on which stands a bowl of Baphomet's blood, steaming and bubbling. Standing in front of it is Lylesburg. To his side Peloquin. Beside him, Rachel. \nOn Lylesburg's other side, Ohnaka. Standing around the walls as witnesses to the ceremony, are a variety of Breed. \nBoone enters. The Breed all look his way. Boone sees Shuna Sassi. \nBOONE [to Narcisse in a whisper]: Who is she? \nNARCISSE: Shuna Sassi. Why? \nBOONE: I dreamt her. \nShuna leans towards Peloquin. \nSHUNA SASSI: I've dreamt him. \nNarcisse nudges Boone forward. \nLYLESBURG: Who is your advocate? \nNARCISSE: I am. \nLYLESBURG: Have you tutored him in the Law? \nBOONE: Yes he has. \nLYLESBURG: Let the advocate answer. \nNARCISSE: Yes I have. \nLYLESBURG: You understand what you do, becoming one of us? With this night you turn your back on the Natural World. The life you lived will after this be as a dream. \nBOONE: I know. \nLylesburg takes the glove off his right hand. The flesh beneath is cauterized. \n", "test2_id": 544, "test3_input": "NARCISSE [cont.]: This is a shortcut! \n206. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK \nThe posse is busily at work around the Necropolis, Eigerman and Kane supervising. Some are laying trails of gasoline through the pathways. Others are simply patrolling, guns in hand. There is an air of nervous anticipation. \nAshberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway, staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary. \nLooking at a particularly large tomb, Ashberry's eye is captivated by a large, fantastically rendered marble winged angel. He approaches it, reaches up to touch it. The angel, a monster, turns to look at him with sad, impassive gravity. Then we see its shadow on Ashberry's face and hear the slow, thick beating of its wings as it flies off. \nAshberry's stunned. He fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off, takes a long drink, then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped to the side of the tomb. He follows the wire that leads off it to another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another. He's panicked. \n207. EXT. NECROPOLIS DUSK \nKane is escorting Eigerman and Pettine down a pathway, pointing out the posse's handiwork. \nKANE: ...packets of plastique at every intersection, trip wires outside the biggest tombs, we figure those'll be the major escape routes... \nEIGERMAN: How much longer? \nKANE: Five minutes. \nEIGERMAN [into walkie-talkie]: Let's pull back to the perimeter before we lose the light. We've got movement underground; they're hearing it round the walls. \nASHBERRY [approaching them from the side]: Captain! \nKANE: Jesus, not there, STOP. [Ashberry freezes] We got Claymores planted in the rosebushes, Reverend, cut your nuts off faster'n a hedge clipper. \nASHBERRY: We've made a mistake, there are Angels here, a heavenly host... \nEIGERMAN: You're drunk, asshole. \nAshberry dumps the bourbon out of his canteen. \nASHBERRY: No. Listen to me, it's wrong, it's sacrilege, this is holy ground... \nEIGERMAN: Get the hell up that hill, you pinhead. \nASHBERRY: You brought me here because I'm a man of God. \nEIGERMAN: That's right; hang round here a couple more minutes, Padre, and you'll be sitting at his left hand. Now get your sorry ass out of the fuckin' way... \nEigerman backhands him. Ashberry falls. Eigerman, Kane, Pettine and the other cops begin to pull back. \nAshberry looks up, as he hears grindings and growls in the earth. Boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb. Ashberry is about to shoot when Narcisse grabs him around the throat, puts a finger to his lips and signals him to be quiet. Narcisse follows Boone into the tomb. The tomb-lid scrapes as it's pushed back into place from beneath. Ashberry starts to pray. \n207A. INT. BELOW MIDIAN \nBoone and Narcisse move through the panicking underground, creatures fleeing in every direction. Boone sees Lylesburg, trying to keep the panic down, moves towards him. \nLYLESBURG: Stay down! Stay where you are, they're waiting for us above... \nBOONE [intercepting him]: No! if you stay here you'll be slaughtered... \nLYLESBURG: This is our home. \nBOONE: Not anymore... \nLYLESBURG: We belong here... \nBOONE: Listen to me, old man, the rules change; if you want to live it won't be here and it won't be by your laws... \nOther creatures have stopped, watching the confrontation. Boone speaks to them as well. \nBOONE [cont.]: If you'want to survive we've got to fight back, we can't hide anymore! [to Lylesburg] What's it gonna be? \nLylesburg slumps, acquiescing, unable to refuse Boone's assertions. \nBOONE [cont.] [to Narcisse]: Get the children above ground, find a hiding place...[to the others] Get ready to fight! [to Lylesburg] What about Baphomet? Can he be moved? \nLYLESBURG: Yes. It could be done. \nBOONE: It must be done. Brothers and sisters, it's time to fight! \n207A. INT. CHAMBERS \nLeroy and Lude listen to Boone on the bridge. \nLEROY: You hear what he said? \nLUDE: What chance have we got? They're armed. \nLEROY [opens jacket]: So am I. \nTwo one-eyed snakes, nesting in Leroy's belly, slide up from his innards and wrap around his neck. \nLEROY: They call us monsters, remember? They're afraid of us. Let's give 'em reason. \nLUDE: It's a long time since I spilled blood. \nLEROY: You never lose the knack. \n208. EXT. HILL ABOVE THE NECROPOLIS DUSK \nFrom this high vantage point, Decker watches the preparations below through binoculars, with the glee of a pyromaniac at a fire-storm. The sun is setting. He stares up at it, squinting into its brightness. \nTHE MASK [V.O.]: ...I'm waiting...Philip?... \nDecker looks towards the patrol car parked nearby. The front door is open. On the passenger seat sits his briefcase. Decker quickly crosses to the car. \nDECKER: Be quiet. \n", "test3_true": "Decker opens the briefcase.

The only monsters I've ever seen had a human face. \nAs Joyce looks down at the Necropolis, Decker sneaks an anxious side- long glance at his briefcase. \n209. INT. NECROPOLIS GATES DUSK \nThe final explosives-layers exit, their backs covered by flamethrower and machine-gun-carrying mob members. A distraught Ashberry is the last out. \nMidian is now completely deserted. Dandelion seeds drift down the walkways, caught in shafts of sunlight. \n210. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST DUSK \nEigerman, Pettine and Kane, looking at their watches. \nKANE [a pause \u0097 then]: ...T-minus fifteen seconds...ten, nine,eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one ... \nEIGERMAN: Go. \nKane depresses the detonator. There are two large explosions, followed by several smaller ones. Part of the Necropolis wall is blasted out. Several members of the posse retreat. Eigerman pulls his pistol. \nEIGERMAN [cont.]: You there, stand your ground! [fires a warning shot] Stand your ground, damn you! \nThe defectors stop. Several more chain explosions in Necropolis. \n211. SCENE DELETED \n212. SCENE DELETED \n213. INT.

We see several creatures howling in bestial terror. \nBabette is separated from Narcisse's group by falling earth, nearly trampled in the chaos. She is picked up by the dog-faced man. \nBABETTE: I want my mother. \nMAN: We'll find her. \n213A. INT. PELOQUIN'S CHAMBER NIGHT \nPeloquin squats on the step overlooking the fire-pit, listening to the sound of invasion from above. There is a mixture of fear and rage on his face. In the darkness opposite, Kinski. \nKINSKI: We began this. \nPELOQUIN: I just wanted meat. I didn't know he was going to cause this. \nKINSKI: There were prophesies. The seventh saviour. \nPELOQUIN: I didn't believe the prophesies and I didn't obey the Law. You want to see me bleed for it? All right, I'll bleed. \nHe exits the chamber. \n214. EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES/COMMAND POST NIGHT \nSmoke billows over the walls. Eigerman moves closer to the gates, listening to the wild cries from inside. He grabs Ashberry by the collar. \nEIGERMAN: That sound like a heavenly choir to you, Padre? \nASHBERRY: I have to see! \nAshberry shakes himself free and heads through the gates, into the Necropolis. Eigerman turns to the others, lights a cigar. \nEIGERMAN: Pettine! \nPETTINE: Chief? \nEIGERMAN: We're moving in. \nPETTINE [locks and loads his machine-gun]: Yes, sir!

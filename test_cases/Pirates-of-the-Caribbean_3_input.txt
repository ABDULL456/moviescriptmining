ELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'll drop it! 
BARBOSSA My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why? 
ELIZABETH Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. 
I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England. 
BARBOSSA (interested) Did you, now? 
Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere. 
ELIZABETH Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it. 
She flips the medallion up, off her finger - 
BARBOSSA NO! 
She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly. 
BARBOSSA (CONT'D) You have a name, missy? 
ELIZABETH Elizabeth - (stops herself from saying "Swann"; then:) Turner. (embroidering) I'm a maid in the governor's household. (curtsies) Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods. 
BARBOSSA You've got sand, for a maid. 
ELIZABETH (curtsies again) Thank you, sir. 
BARBOSSA 
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps? 
ELIZABETH Of course. (offended) I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean. 
BARBOSSA No, no, nothing like that. (comes to a decision) Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return. 
ELIZABETH Can I trust you? 
BARBOSSA It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear! 
Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope. 
ELIZABETH Our bargain. . ? 
Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun. 
BOSUN Still the guns, and stow 'em! Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port! 
For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved. The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away. 
ELIZABETH Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren - 
Barbossa wheels on her. 
BARBOSSA First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And thirdly... 
the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. 
(grins gold and silver) 
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner. 
Elizabeth stares in speechless terror - 
EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN 
As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back along the deck to the captain's cabin. 
The fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist; through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of dawn. 
EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN 
Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet. 
He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth. 
Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion. 
INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING 
Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls out: 
WILL Miss Swann! Elizabeth! 
A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned chair, fallen bookshelf - 
INT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe. 
WILL They've taken her! They've taken Elizabeth! 
A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair.

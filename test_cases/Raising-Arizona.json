Moses is a gnarled, elderly black con with wire-rimmed spectacles. On the lower bunk, also with hands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same spot in space, is Hi. \nVOICE OVER I tried to sort through what the Doc had said, but prison ain't the easiest place to think. \nMOSES An' when they was no meat we ate fowl. An' when they was no fowl we ate crawdad. An' when they was no crawdad to be foun', we ate San'. \nHI You ate what? \nMOSES (nodding) We ate San'. \nHI You ate sand?! \nMOSES Dass right... \nPAROLE BOARD ROOM \nHi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. \nCHAIRMAN Well Boy, you done served your twenty munce, and seeing as you never use live ammo, we got no choice but to return you to society. \nSECOND MAN These doors goan swing wide. \nHI I didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir. \nSECOND MAN Hi, we respect that. \nCHAIRMAN But you're just hurtin' yourself with this rambunctious behavior. \nHI I know that, sir. \nCHAIRMAN Okay then. \nHIGH SHOT \nOf a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling. \nVOICE OVER Now I don't know how you come down on the incarceration question... \nHi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. \nVOICE OVER ...whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge. \nHe spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the back door. Locked. \nVOICE OVER ...But I was beginning to think... \nAs we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. \nVOICE OVER ...that revenge is the only argument makes any sense. \nFLASH \nOn Hi against the mug-shot wall. \nED Turn to the right! \nSHERIFF (O.S.) Don't forget his latents, Ed! \nCLOSE ON HI'S HAND \nWe see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet. \nHI (O.S.) Hear about the paddy-wagon collided with the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve hardened criminals escaped. \nEd's hand lingers on top of his.  Hi's other hand enters to rest on top of hers. \nHI (O.S.) Got a new beau? \nED (O.S.) No, Hi, I sure don't. \nHi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's. \nHI (O.S.) Don't worry, I paid for it. \nLOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR \nThe surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the foreground. \nHi is being escorted past him to his cell. \nVOICE OVER They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and for once they may be right. \nHalfway up the corridor Hi points casually at the floor. \nHI You missed a spot. \nThe Mopping Con turns to watch him recede. \nCON Grrrr... \nHIGH ANGLE CELL \nSame high shot with Moses on the top bunk, Hi on the lower. \nVOICE OVER More and more my thoughts turned to Ed, and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment. \nMOSES An' momma would frow the live crawdad in a pot of boiln' water. Well one day I decided to make my own crawdad... \nWe begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring Hi. \nVOICE OVER ...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin' to put in the water, ya see... \nMoses' voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame. \n", "test1_true": "We are now very close on Hi, staring. \nVOICE OVER ...when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman. \nHI'S POV \nThe underside of the top bunk. \nA sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed, smiling behind her camera, softly supered on the underside of the bunk. \nBACK TO HI \nHe wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes. \nVOICE OVER But I couldn't help thinking that a brighter future lay ahead - a future that was only eight to fourteen months away. \nEyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash. \nPAROLE BOARD ROOM \nHi and the same three officers. \nCHAIRMAN Got a name for people like you, Hi. That name is called recidivism. \nSECOND MAN Ree-peat O-fender. \nCHAIRMAN Not a pretty name, is it, Hi? \nHI No Sir, it sure ain't. That's one bonehead name.

Ed looks up from her camera, having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the hatched wall. \nHI I'm walkin' in here on my knees, Ed - a free man proposin'. \nHi cocks a finger at the suspect. \nHI Howdy Kurt. \nED'S ROOM \nAs she nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of a mirror. \nVOICE OVER And so it was. \nSHERIFF (O.S.) Don't forget the boo-kay, Ed! \nCLOSE SHOT ED \nGazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated behind her - the bride's side wearing police blues; the groom's side, Hawaiian shirts. \nED I do. \nCLOSE SHOT HI \nAlso staring into the camera. \nHI You bet I do. \nREVERSE \nOver their shoulders, the minister. \nMINISTER Okay then. \nFLASH \nOn the newlyweds smiling at the camera. \nFLASH \nOn the newlyweds smiling at each other, profile to the camera. \nHIGH WIDE SHOT TRAILER PARK \nIn the middle of a vast expanse of desert. \nVOICE OVER Ed's pa staked us to a starter home in suburban Tempe... \nINT. MACHINE SHOP \nHi is working the drill press, wearing goggles and sweat- stained overalls. \nVOICE OVER ...and I got a job drilling holes in sheet metal. \nNext to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead. \nBUD So we was doin' paramedical work in affiliation with the state highway system-not actually practicin', y'understand - and me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile - \n", "test1_id": 552, "test2_input": "GLEN I'll pitch my voice wherever I please! His name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't Ed Jr.! But it's junior an right! Yes sir, it's Nathan Jr.! \nHi takes one step down holding out a calming hand. \nGlen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon. \nGLEN ...Stay away from me, McDunnough! \nHi stops short. Glen smiles. \nGLEN ...Sure, you're an awful big man when you got somethin' around to clobber a guy with! \nHI (softly) I ain't a big man. \nGLEN That's right! And now you're at my mercy! \nHe spits on the dirt in front of him. \nGLEN ...I'm your worst nightmare!  I wanted to just turn you in for the re-ward. But Dot, she wants something to cuddle. So it looks like that baby's gonna be Glen Jr. From now on! \nHi's face is set in rigid dismay. \nGLEN ...I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed... \nGlen is getting into his car. \nGLEN ...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him up. \nHe slams the door. \nGLEN ...It's either that or jail. Oh and say, that reminds me! You'll find a doctor bill in the mail in a few days. I recommend you pay it! \nAnd the car squeals off. \nHi looks back at the trailer. \nHIS POV \nA slat in the window blind drops back into place. \nBACK TO HI \nHe opens the door. \nINT. TRAILER \nEvelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms. \nHi moves toward Evelle. His teeth are set; he means business. \nHI What's goin' on here. \nGale steps in front of Hi. \nGALE You know what's goin' on, H.I. It's just business. Now this can go either hard or easy- \nHi gives Gale a hard push to get past him. Gale staggers back but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug. \nHi flips Gale. Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up and crashes back down. \nEvelle is dancing back out of Hi's reach. As Hi lunges for him the prostrate Gale grabs his legs. \nHi goes down hard. \nGale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against an overhanging lamp. Both of his hands fly up to massage the top of his head. \nTHOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale's unguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gut. \nHi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands. \nWith Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swings his hands up over his head. \nHi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. \nHi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. \nGale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. \nThe reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesn't stop the punch. \nIt connects with Hi's jaw. \nGale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. \nHi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. \nHi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face. \nGale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. \nGale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too- small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. \nClose shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and clutching at it. \nEvelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts. \nEXT. WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER \nAt the cut Gale's roaring drops out. We hear the chirping of birds and the laughter of children playing in the neighborhood. \nIt is a sunny day. \nBACK TO INT. TRAILER \nGale still roars. With a last mighty effort, he finally swings Hi off his body. \n", "test2_true": "BATHROOM \nAmid a shower of plaster dust and lath. Hi has landed, groggily, against the toilet. \nEvelle enters now with his hands free, apparently having set the baby down somewhere. \nHe yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds. \nLIVING ROOM \nHi is seated in a straight-back chair, still violently struggling but Gale's arms are wrapped around him from behind. \nEvelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the chair. \nNo one talks; there is nothing left to say. \nFinished, Gale goes to the door and Evelle goes to the bedroom. He emerges with the baby and precedes Gale out the door, Gale slamming it behind him. \nHi starts bucking and struggling, weeping tears of rage and frustration. He succeeds only in tipping forward, face down into the carpet, the strapped-on chair pressing down on top of him. \nHis profile is pressed into the carpet. \nOffscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening. \nHI'S POV \nAt carpet level. Gale's shoes enter his field of vision. They stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the living room. \nOBJECTIVE SHOT \nAs Gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. He grabs the book. \nHI'S POV \nThe feet walk away and leave his field of vision. \nCLOSE ON HI \nAs we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality. \nHi's mouth stretches wide. He ROARS with grief and frustration. \nWIDE SHOT \nMoving down the road toward an oncoming car. As the oncoming car gets closer we can see Gale and Evelle in its front seat. \nAs the car passes we pan with it, to reveal that we have been shooting from the inside of another car, and we hold on the profile of its driver: Ed. She has just watched the other car shoot past. \nED ...Good. \nQUICK FADE OUT \nINT. DEVASTATED TRAILER \nAs Ed sits heavily into frame, apparently in shock, her frozen profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space. \nHer foreground hand absently holds a length of cord. \nBeyond her in the middle background Hi is rummaging in the debris. He stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts loading bullets into the chamber of Ed's .38 police special. \nHI (frantically) I know you're worried honey but believe me, there ain't a thing to worry about. We're gonna get him back, there just ain't no question about that... \nHe snaps the chamber shut and leaves frame, still talking. \nHI ...We'll get him back, that's just all there is to it. And you wanna know another thing? \nHe is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in addition to the .38, this one an automatic. \nHI ...I'm gonna be a better person from here on out. And that's final, I mean that's absolutely the way it's gonna be, that's official. You were right and I was wrong... \nHe snaps a clip into the automatic. \nHI ...A blind man could tell you that. Now they ain't gonna hurt him, they're just in it for the score... \nHi is leaving frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him rummaging offscreen. \nHI ...But I ain't like that no more, I'm a changed man. You were right and I was wrong. We got a family here and I'm gonna start acting responsibly... \nHi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt, holding his pump-action shotgun. \nHI ...So let's go honey... \nHe primes the shotgun: WHOOSH-CLACK. \nHI ...Let's go get Nathan Jr. \nTRACKING SHOT \nFrom the front bumper of an automobile. Beautiful desert stretches to the horizon. The road rushes under the camera. \nGALE AND EVELLE'S CAR \nGale drives, gazing out at the road. Evelle holds Nathan Jr., occasionally bouncing him. \nContemplatively: \nGALE I luuuuv to drive. \nEVELLE You said somethin' there, partner. \nGALE ...Yessir, I figure with the ransom and this bank, you'n I'll be sittin' in the fabled catbird seat. \nEvelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap. \nEVELLE Uh, Gale... Junior had a, uh, accident. \n", "test2_id": 553, "test3_input": "HI No sir, that's who we saved him from. It's a long story. \nNATHAN Suppose you tell it. \nHI Well, sir, in a re-ward situation, they usually say no questions asked. \nNATHAN Do they. \nHi shrugs. \nNathan turns to put the baby back in the crib. \nNATHAN ...All right, boy, I guess you got a re-ward coming. Twenty thousand dollars... \nHe turns around with a thought: \nNATHAN ...Or, if you need home furnishings, I can give you a fine of credit at any of my stores. Fact, that's the way I'd rather handle it, for tax reasons... \nHI Well- \nNathan throws his hands up in the air. \nNATHAN But it's up to you. \nHI Tell you the truth, I think we'd prefer the ca- \nED We don't want no reward. \nHi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. \nED ...We didn't bring him back for money. \nNATHAN Well, we could work it that way too. \nED Could I just look at him a little bit more? \nShe stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. \nNATHAN Be my guest, young lady... but would you mind tellin' me exactly how you- \nEd starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs something to comfort her. \nNathan is studying the two of them. \nNATHAN ...You took him, didn't you? Wasn't that biker a'tal. \nHi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush. \nHI I took him, sir, my wife had nothin' to do with it. I crept in yon window and- \nED (still crying) We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt him any; I just wanted to be a mama. \nHI It wasn't for money or nothin'. We just figured you had more'n you could handle, babywise. But I'm the one committed the actual crime sir, if you need to call the authorities- \nNATHAN Shutup boy, no one's callin' the authorities if there's no harm done. \nHI Thank you sir. \nED Thank you sir. \nNATHAN Aw bullshit. Just tell me - just tell me why you did it. \nED We can't have our own. \nNathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs. \nNATHAN ...Well lookit. If you can't have kids you gotta just keep tryin' and hope medical science catches up with you. Like Florence'n me - it caught up with a vengeance. And hell, even if it never does, you still got each other. \nHI Sir, those're kind words. But I think the wife and me are splittin' up... \nHe indicates Ed with a nod of the head. \nHI ...Her point of view is we're both kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we ain't too good for each other. \nNATHAN Well ma'am, I don't know much but I do know human bein's. You brought back my boy so you must have your good points too. I'd sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me - I do love her so... \nHe clears his throat and turns to the door. His tone is harder again: \nNATHAN ...You can go out the way you came in... \nHe snaps off the lights. \nNATHAN ...And before you go off and do another foolish thing, like busting up, I suggest you sleep on it... \nHe has disappeared into the hall. We hear his voice receding: \nNATHAN ...at least one night. \nHIGH SHOT \nLooking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. We start to crane down. \nVOICE OVER That night I had a dream... \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT \nA beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of. \nIn the middle background of the extreme long shot two men are walking across the field. \nVOICE OVER ...I dreamt I was as light as the ether, a floating spirit visiting things to come... \nBACK TO HIGH SHOT BEDROOM \nCraning down toward Hi. \n", "test3_true": "BACK TO FIELD \nStill floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men. We see that they are Gale and Evelle. Both are still dyed blue. \nThey are approaching the hole in the ground. \nVOICE OVER I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had decided to return to prison... \nEvelle is starting to climb into the hole. \nVOICE OVER ...Probably that's just as well. I don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell couple guys, but... \nEvelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in. \nVOICE OVER ...maybe they weren't ready yet to come out into the world. \nFLOATING UP THE WALK OF THE ARIZONA HONE \nThe front door has a holly wreath on it. \nVOICE OVER And then I dreamed on, into the future, to a Christmas morn in the Arizona home... \nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO \nARIZONA LIVING ROOM \nFive three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on. \nVOICE OVER ...where Nathan Jr. was opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown. \nWe have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr. Inside is a shiny red plastic football. \nFLOATING IN TOWARD A STATION WAGON \nPulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle parked behind it. Glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him. \nVOICE OVER I saw Glen, a few years later, still havin' no luck gettin' the cops to listen to his wild tales about me'n Ed... \nGlen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. \nThe trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and slaps his knee. \nVOICE OVER ...Maybe he threw in one Pollack joke too many... \nThe trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. The name tag on the pocket says \"SGT. KOWALSKI.\" \nVOICE OVER ...I don't know. \nFLOATING IN TOWARD A FOOTBALL \nIt sits on a tee in the middle of a football field. \nVOICE OVER And still I dreamed on... \nA cleated foot boots the football out of frame. \nVOICE OVER ...further into the future than I'd ever dreamed before. \nHIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER \nLooking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the kicked ball. \nVOICE OVER ...Watching Nathan Jr.'s progress from afar... \nHe catches the ball and starts running. \nVOICE OVER ...Taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own... \nHe is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers. \nVOICE OVER ...Wondering if he ever thought of us. \nHe reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football. \nHe whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser. \nVOICE OVER ...and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little, even if he couldn't remember just how they'd got broadened. \nBACK TO BEDROOM \nStill craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi. \nVOICE OVER But still I hadn't dreamt nothin' about me'n Ed. Until the end... \nDISSOLVE THROUGH TO \nA COUPLE \nThe man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden light. \nAs they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white hair, the woman's pulled into a bun. The old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl. \nVOICE OVER ...And this was cloudier 'cause it was years, years away. \nThe front door bursts open. Two young couples are entering as their kids - about a dozen of them - stream in around them. \nThe old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their visitors. The children boil onto the couch. \nVOICE OVER ...But I saw an old couple bein' visited by their children - and all their grandchildren too. And the old couple wasn't screwed up, and neither were their kids or their grandkids. And I don't know, you tell me. This whole dream, was it wishful thinking? Was I just fleein' reality, like I know I'm liable to do? \nFLOATING IN TOWARD A LONG DINING TABLE \nIn the trailer. The table is all laid out with a Thanksgiving dinner, a huge turkey sitting at the far end. \nCut-out letters at the other end of the room say: \"WELCOME HOME KIDS!\" \n", "test3_id": 554}

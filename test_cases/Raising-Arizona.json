{"train": "RAISING ARIZONA \nRAISING ARIZONA \nScreenplay by \nEthan Coen \nJoel Coen \nOVER BLACK: \nVOICE OVER My name is H. I. McDunnough... \nA WALL \nWith horizontal hatch lines. \nVOICE OVER ...Call me Hi. \nA disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen. \nHe holds a printed paddle that reads \"NO. 1468-6 NOV. 29 \nThe hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers. \nVOICE OVER ...The first time I met Ed was in the county lock-up in Tempe, Arizona... \nFLASH \nAs his picture is taken. \nCLOSEUP \nOn the paddle: \"NOV. 29 79.\" \nVOICE OVER ...a day I'll never forget. \nA bellowing male voice from offscreen: \nSHERIFF Don't forget the profile, Ed! \nANGLE ON THE STILL CAMERA \nIt is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it. \nWOMAN Turn to the right. \nHI What kind of name is Ed for a pretty thing like you? \nED Short for Edwinna. Turn to the right! \nHI obliges, but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye. \nHI You're a flower, you are. Just a little desert flower. \nFLASH \nOn his eye-skewed profile. \nHI Lemme know how those come out. \nLOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR \nAs Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell. \nAt the far end of the corridor a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor. \nVOICE OVER I was in for writing hot checks which, when businessmen do it, is called an overdraft. I'm not complainin', mind you; just sayin' there ain't no pancake so thin it ain't got two sides. Now prison life is very structured - more than most people care for... \nINTERCUTTING \nHI'S POV of the MOPPING CON, tracking as he approaches, and the Mopping Con's POV of Hi as Hi approaches. \nVOICE OVER ...But there's a spirit of camaraderie that exists between the men, like you find only in combat maybe... \nThe Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes: \nCON Grrrr... \nVOICE OVER ...or on a pro ball club in the heat of a pennant drive. \nNEWSREEL FOOTAGE \nA ballplayer connects - THWOCK - for a home run and the crowd roars. \nPRISON HALL \nPanning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs. The pan starts on Hi. \nVOICE OVER In an effort to better ourselves we were forced to meet with a counselor who tried to help us figure out why we were the way we were... \nAt this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back. \nHe is addressing one of the Cons: \nCOUNSELOR Why do you use the word \"trapped\"? \nCLOSEUP BLACK CON \nThe huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation. \nCON Huh? \nCOUNSELOR Why do you say you feel \"trapped\" in a man's body? \nHIGH ANGLE CELL \nLooking down from the ceiling. In the foreground, lying on the top bunk, hands clasped behind his head as he stares off into space is MOSES. Moses is a gnarled, elderly black con with wire-rimmed spectacles. On the lower bunk, also with hands clasped behind his head and staring off at the same spot in space, is Hi. \nVOICE OVER I tried to sort through what the Doc had said, but prison ain't the easiest place to think. \nMOSES An' when they was no meat we ate fowl. An' when they was no fowl we ate crawdad. An' when they was no crawdad to be foun', we ate San'. \nHI You ate what? \nMOSES (nodding) We ate San'. \nHI You ate sand?! \nMOSES Dass right... \nPAROLE BOARD ROOM \nHi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. \nCHAIRMAN Well Boy, you done served your twenty munce, and seeing as you never use live ammo, we got no choice but to return you to society. \nSECOND MAN These doors goan swing wide. \nHI I didn't want to hurt anyone, Sir. \nSECOND MAN Hi, we respect that. \nCHAIRMAN But you're just hurtin' yourself with this rambunctious behavior. \nHI I know that, sir. \nCHAIRMAN Okay then. \nHIGH SHOT \nOf a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling. \nVOICE OVER Now I don't know how you come down on the incarceration question... \nHi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. \nVOICE OVER ...whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge. \nHe spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the back door. Locked. \nVOICE OVER ...But I was beginning to think... \nAs we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. \nVOICE OVER ...that revenge is the only argument makes any sense. \nFLASH \nOn Hi against the mug-shot wall. \nED Turn to the right! \nSHERIFF (O.S.) Don't forget his latents, Ed! \nCLOSE ON HI'S HAND \nWe see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet. \nHI (O.S.) Hear about the paddy-wagon collided with the segment mixer, Ed? Twelve hardened criminals escaped. \nEd's hand lingers on top of his.  Hi's other hand enters to rest on top of hers. \nHI (O.S.) Got a new beau? \nED (O.S.) No, Hi, I sure don't. \nHi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's. \nHI (O.S.) Don't worry, I paid for it. \nLOW ANGLE CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR \nThe surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the foreground. \nHi is being escorted past him to his cell. \nVOICE OVER They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and for once they may be right. \nHalfway up the corridor Hi points casually at the floor. \nHI You missed a spot. \nThe Mopping Con turns to watch him recede. \nCON Grrrr... \nHIGH ANGLE CELL \nSame high shot with Moses on the top bunk, Hi on the lower. \nVOICE OVER More and more my thoughts turned to Ed, and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment. \nMOSES An' momma would frow the live crawdad in a pot of boiln' water. Well one day I decided to make my own crawdad... \nWe begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring Hi. \nVOICE OVER ...an' I frew it in a pot, forgettin' to put in the water, ya see... \nMoses' voice is mixing down as we lose him from frame. \nHI Bill Roberts? \nBUD (barking) No, not that motherscratcher! Bill Parker! Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck, and there's a spherical object arestin' on the highway... \nHe pauses to blow and pop a bubble with his chewing gum. \nBUD ...And it don't look like a piece a the car. \nVOICE OVER Mostways the job was a lot like prison, except Ed was waitin' at the end of every day... \nCASHIER'S WINDOW \nHi is scowling at his paycheck. Behind the barred window a fat cashier grins. \nVOICE OVER ...and a paycheck at the end of every week. \nCASHIER Gummint do take a bite, don't she? \nEXT. TRAILER \nHi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. Ed sits on his lap, his arms around her. Both are wearing sunglasses, looking at the setting sun. The scene is suffused with a warm yellow light. \nVOICE OVER These were the happy days, the salad days as they say... \nAs the sun sets, the light is turning from yellow to amber. Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward arc. \nVOICE OVER ...and Ed felt that having a critter was the next logical step. It was all she thought about. \nThe amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the sun has set. Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared. \nVOICE OVER ...Her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us... \nThe dusk is slipping away into darkness. \nVOICE OVER ...and every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret having missed. \nWe are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp. From the darkness: \nED That was beautiful. \nA CALENDAR \nEd is crossing off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red. \nVOICE OVER So we worked at it on the days we calculated most likely to be fruitful... \nINT. TRAILER \nHi is wearily entering after a long day at work, clutching his lunchpail. \nVOICE OVER ...and we worked at it most other days just to be sure. \nEd flies into frame and leaps into his arms, covering him with kisses. \nTRAILER BEDROOM \nIn each other's arms, Hi and Ed roll over on the bed. \nVOICE OVER Seemed like nothing could stand in our way now... \nWe pan with them rolling and continue off them to the night table, on which sits a framed pair of photographs of Hi, probably taken by Ed: One shows him full face, the other in profile. \nEXT. TRAILER TWILIGHT \nEd sits in a lawn chair knitting a booty. Hi stands in Bermuda shorts and an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, hosing down the minuscule patch of front lawn. \nVOICE OVER ...My lawless years were behind me; our child rearin' years lay ahead. \nDUSTY ROAD LEADING UP TO TRAILER DAY \nA squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground. \nADOPTION OFFICE \nHi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt. Ed is in her dress blues. \nHI It's true I've had a checkered past, but Ed here is an officer of the law twice decorated... \nTHE AGENT \nLooking, with a dead pan, from the file to Hi. \nHI ...So we figure it kind of evens out. \nHis face still deadly neutral, the agent looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple feet long. \nVOICE OVER ...But biology and the prejudices of others conspired to keep us childless. \nINT. SQUAD CAR \nOn Ed as she stares vacantly out the passenger window. \nVOICE OVER Our love for each other was stronger than ever... \nON HI \nDriving. He looks from Ed out to the road. \nVOICE OVER ...but I preminisced no return of the salad days. \nTRAILER BATHROOM \nOver Hi's shoulder as he stares listlessly at himself in the mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half lathered and half shaved. \nVOICE OVER The pizazz had gone out of our lives. \nLIVING ROOM \nNathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper. \nWe can hear Florence's returning footsteps. Muttering: \nNATHAN Christian Dior my butt... \nFlorence enters. \nNATHAN ...They pay money for that? \nFLORENCE Yes dear. \nNATHAN How're the kids? \nFLORENCE Fine dear. \nNATHAN Fuckin' kids, I love 'em. \nWe hear the bleat of the squeeze-me toy. Florence and Nathan look at the ceiling for a beat, then Nathan clears his throat and returns to the newspaper. \nCHEVY \nEd sits anxiously waiting in the driver's seat, peering intently through the windshield. As she catches sight of something she breaks into a broad smile, unlocks the door, and slides over to the passenger seat. \nHi is opening the door with one hand, cradling a baby in the other. \nED Which one ya get? \nAs he gets into the driver's seat: \nHI I dunno. Nathan Jr., I think. \nED Gimme here. \nHe hands her the infant, then hands her the copy of Dr.Spock's Baby and Child Care. \nHI Here's the instructions. \nED Oh, he's beautiful! \nHi nods as he pulls away from the curb. \nHI He's awful damn good. I think I got the best one. \nEd is gushing and kissing the baby through the rest of the conversation. \nED I bet they were all beautiful. All babies are beautiful! \nHI Yeah. This one's awful damn good though. \nED Don't you cuss around him. \nHI He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan Jr. \nED We are doin' the right thing, aren't we Hi? - I mean, they had more'n they could handle. \nHI Well now honey we been over this and over this. There's what's right and there's what's right, and never the twain shall meet. \nED But you don't think his momma'll be upset? I mean overly? \nHI Well a course she'll be upset, sugar, but she'll get over it. She's got four little babies almost as good as this one. It's like when I was robbin' convenience stores - \nEd suddenly bursts out crying. \nED I love him so much! \nHI I know you do, honey. \nED (still sobbing) I love him so much! \nTRAILER LIVING ROOM \nAs the lights are thrown on. The room is hung with streamers. A string of cut-out letters reads \"Welcome Home Son!\" \nHI (O.S.) Okay, bring him in! \nREVERSE \nEd is entering with Nathan Jr. \nHI This is it young Nathan Jr. Just feast your eyes about, old boy! \nED Don't be so loud around him, Hi. \nHI (softly) Damn, I'm sorry honey. \nED And don't you cuss around him. \nHI Aw, he don't know a cuss word from shinola. \nED Well see that he don't. \nHI (jovially) He's all right, he is. \nHe reaches for the child. \nHI ...Come on over here, Nathan Jr., I'll show you around. \nHe takes the baby in both hands and holds him out at arm's length, pointing him at the various places of interest. The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one. \nHI ...Lookahere, young sportsman. That - there's the kitchen area where Ma and Pa chow down. Over there's the TV, two hours a day maximum, either educational or football so's you don't ruin your appreciation of the finer things. This - here's the divan, for sociahzin' and relaxin' with the family unit. Yessir, many's the day we sat there and said wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster here to share our thoughts and feelin's - \nImpatient with the nonsense: \nBoth are bellowing. \nMud sucks and pops. \nThunder crashes. \nINT. GAS STATION MENS ROOM \nAt the cut the ear-splitting thunder drops out to quiet. We hear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare fluorescent. \nThe two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side, combing their hair in the mirror. The men seem absorbed in their task, using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the shelf between them to restore their duck's-ass haircuts. \nEvelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain. \nEVELLE ...Okay. \nGALE What is it? \nEVELLE Mercury. Looks nice. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nThe two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended at a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank. \nAs Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as Evelle gets in. \nWIDE SHOT TRAILER LIVING ROOM \nLate at night. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light. \nWe hear faint, distant knocking. As we track in toward Hi the knocking becomes louder and more present. \nAs we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread over his gently rising and falling chest. \nBy the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become quite loud. \nVOICE Open up! \nHi starts awake with a grunt. \nVOICE ...Open up in air! \nHe looks up, alarmed. \nHI'S POV \nThe front door of the trailer. Someone is pounding insistently. \nVOICE Open up! It's a police! \nBACK TO HI \nHe sits up and tenses. He looks around. \nEd stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway, holding Nathan Jr. and squinting at Hi. She hisses: \nED Hi! What's goin' on? \nVOICE Po-lice, son! Open her up! \nHi gets to his feet, hurriedly tosses the Polaroids under a cushion of the couch and takes out a gun. \nHI Get in the bedroom. \nED They ain't gonna take Nathan?! \nHI Well I'd like to see 'em fly. \nAs Ed turns back to the bedroom: \nVOICE Open up and maybe we'll letcha plea- bargain. \nBEDROOM \nAs Ed enters and shuts the door. She listens hard at the door: \nHi's footsteps cross the living room, the click of the door opening, silence... a burst of raucous male laughter. \nHI'S VOICE ...Honey! Come on out here! Want you to meet a couple friends of mine! \nLIVING ROOM \nAs Ed enters, carrying Nathan Jr. All three men - Hi, Gale, and Evelle - are beaming at her. \nHI Honey, like you to meet Gale and Evelle Snopes, fine a pair as ever broke and entered. \nGale roars with laughter. \nHI ...Boys, this - here's my wife. \nGALE Ma'am. \nEVELLE Miz McDunnough. \nEd smiles politely, then squints at Hi. \nED Kind of late for visitors, isn't it Hi? \nHI Well yeah honey, but these boys tell me they just got outta the joint. Gotta show a little hospitality. \nGale is admiring the baby. \nGALE Well now H.I., looks like you been up to the devil's bidnis! \nEVELLE That a him or a her? \nED Promise just a day or two. \nHI Tonight and tomorrow, tops. \nEXTREME HIGH ANGLE \nLooking straight down at Hi, asleep in bed. It is later: filtering softly in from the other room is the end of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" on TV. We are craning down. \nVOICE OVER That night I had a dream. \nFLASH CUT \nFor a brief moment we see a wall of flames and hear it roar. \nBACK TO HI \nStill craning down. \nVOICE OVER ...I'd drifted off thinkin' about happiness, birth, and new life... \nFLASH CUT \nWall of flames. Deafening roar. \nBACK TO HI \nCraning down. The faint National Anthem ends: we hear the WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern. \nVOICE OVER But now I was haunted by a vision of - \nWALL OF FLAMES \nRoaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! a huge low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion. \nThe chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides. \nVOICE OVER He was horrible... \nThe Biker roars out of frame. \nLOW-ANGLE REVERSE \nAs the Biker roars into frame, his rear tire laying down a wake of fire. \nVOICE OVER ...a lone biker of the apocalypse... \nTRACKING ON BIKER \nAs he roars along a ribbon of desert highway. \nVOICE OVER ...a man with all the powers of her at his command. \nThe Biker reaches for his bullwhip. \nVOICE OVER ...He could turn the day into night... \nThe Biker cracks the whip and, at the crack: \nThe sky behind him turns instantly to black. Bolts of lightning crackle across it as thunder roars. \nANOTHER DESERT SCENE DAY \nTracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway. He is reaching for the two sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back. \nVOICE OVER ...and laid to waste everything in his path. \nREVERSE TRACK ON BIKER \nPulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns. The tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground. \nVOICE OVER He was especially hard on the little things... \nCRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground rabbit keels over. The Biker slues the other gun around. \nLOCKED-DOWN WIDE SHOT \nOn a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself. \nThe Biker is approaching in the distant background. \nVOICE OVER ...the helpless and the gentle creatures. \nCRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away. \nLOCKED-DOWN LOW-ANGLE WIDE SHOT \nOf the empty desert road stretching away. In the foreground a lone desert flower blooms. \nThe Biker roars into frame. \nVOICE OVER He left a scorched earth in his wake, befouling even the sweet desert breeze that whipped across his brow. \nAs the Biker roars away, the foreground flower bends with his draft and then bursts into flame. \nTRACKING ON BIKER \nFrom in front. He twirls the shotguns in either hand and reaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their holsters. \nVOICE OVER I didn't know where he came from or why... \nWe are moving in on his chest, where two crisscrossed bandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades, their silver pins glinting in the sun. We follow the line of one of the bandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo: \"Mama Didn't Love Me.\" \nVOICE OVER I didn't know if he was dream or vision... \nREVERSE TRACK ON BIKER \nAs Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he calls back over his shoulder: \nNATHAN But remember, it's still business as usual at Unpainted Arizona, and if you can find lower prices anywhere my name still ain't Nathan Arizona! \nWe are following the two, hand-held, as the Police leads Nathan toward the living room. \nLIVING ROOM \nThe room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes detectives. \nThe original Policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a white-smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar sheets. \nThe dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire and overlapping. \nPOLICEMAN Mr. Byrum here can take your exemplars while you talk. \nMR. BYRUM has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad. \nBYRUM Just let your hand relax; I'll do the work. \nNathan jerks his hand away. \nNATHAN What is this?! I didn't steal the damn kid! \nTwo men in conservative suits are approaching. \nPOLICEMAN Sir, these men are from the FBI- \nNATHAN (bewildered) Are you boys crazy?! All I know is I wake up this morning with my wife screaming- \nBYRUM (patiently) We just need to distinguish your prints from the perpetrators', if they left any. \nGiving his hand back: \nNATHAN Course! I know that! \nFBI #1 Sir, we have an indication you were born Nathan Huffhines; is this correct? \nNATHAN Yeah, I changed m'name; what of it? \nFBI #2 Could you give us an indication why? \nNATHAN Yeah, would you buy furniture at a store called Unpainted Huffhines? \nFBI #1 All right, I'll get to the point- \nUNIFORMED COP Was the child wearing anything when he was abducted? \nNATHAN No one sleeps nekkid in this house, boy! He was wear- \nFBI #1 I'm asking the questions here, officer. \nCOP If we're gonna put out an APB we need a description of the - \nNATHAN He was wearin' his- \nFBI #2 It's just that we're better trained to intervene in crisis situations (to Nathan) What was he wearing? \nNATHAN A dinner jacket! Wuddya think, he was wearing his damn jammies! \nFBI #2 (to cop) The child was wearing his jammies. Are you happy? \nFBI #1 Do you have any disgruntled employees? \nNATHAN Hell, they're all disgruntled! I ain't runnin' a damn daisy farm! \nCOP What did the pajamas- \nNATHAN My motto is do it my way or watch your butt! \nCOP What did the pajamas- \nFBI #1 So you think it might have been an employee? \nNATHAN Don't make me laugh. Without my say- so they don't piss with their pants on fire. \nCOP What did the pajamas look like? \nFBI #1 (pained) Officer- \nNATHAN (bellowing) I dunno, they were jammies! They had Yodas'n shit on 'em! \nBELLOWING VOICE OFFSCREEN Would ya mind, I'm trying to set up a Command Post here! \nNathan bellows back: \nNATHAN Get your feet off m'damn coffee table! \nAlso raising his voice at the offscreen bellower: \nFBI #1 Ron, you're upsetting the victim. \nNathan is getting worked up. \nNATHAN Damnit, are you boys gonna go chase down your leads or are you gonna sit drinkin' coffee in the one house in the state where I know my boy ain't at?! \nFBI #2 Sir, there aren't any \"leads\" yet, aside from this coat- \nNATHAN Gimme that! \nHe grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI #2. \nNATHAN That's a five-hundred-dollar camel's hair- \nBYRUM Sir, you might want to wash your hands at this point. \nED He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey. \nHi shrugs, then flinches as a piece of jello hits his shoulder. \nHI ...Uh-huh. \nDOT You started his bank accounts? \nED Have we done that honey? We gotta do that honey. What's that for, Dot? \nDOT That-there's for his orthodonture and his college. You soak his thumb in iodine you might get by without the orthodonture, but it won't knock any off the college. \nHi sits stoically. Dot is looking offscreen: \nDOT ...Reilly, take that diaper off your head and put it back on your sister!... Anyway, you probably got the life insurance all squared away. \nED You done that yet honey? \nDOT You gotta do that, Hi! Ed here's got her hands full with that little angel! \nHI (dully) Yes ma'am. \nDOT What would Ed and the angel do if a truck came along and splattered your brains all over the interstate? Where would you be then? \nED Yeah honey, what if you get run over? \nDOT Or you got carried off by a twister? \nLAKESIDE PATH \nWe are tracking on Hi and Glen as they walk side by side. Glen is sopping wet, wearing only swimming suit and wing- tipped shoes. His body is ghostly pale except for a V-area at his neck and his arms below the short-sleeve line, which are a bright angry red. \nGLEN Hear about the person of the Polish persuasion he walks into a bar holdin' a pile of shit in his hands, says \"Look what I almost stepped in.\" \nGlen bursts out laughing; Hi walks on in silence. \nHI ...Yeah, that's funny all right... \nGLEN Ya damn right it's funny! Shit man, what's the matter? \nHI I dunno... maybe it's wife, kids, family life... I mean are you, uh, satisfied Glen?  Don't y'ever feel suffocated? Like, like there's somethin' big pressin' down... \nGLEN (solemnly) Eeeeeyep... I do know the feelin'. \nHi shakes his head. \nHI Dunno- \nGLEN And I told Dottie to lose some weight but she don't wanna listen! \nHe roars with laughter and slaps Hi heartily on the back. As he chuckles sympathetically: \nGLEN ...No man, I know what you mean. You got all kinds a responsibilities now. You're married, ya got a kid, looks like your whole life's set down and where's the excitement? \nHI Yeah Glen, I guess that's it. \nGLEN Okay! That's the disease, but there is a cure. \nHI Yeah? \nGLEN Sure; Doctor Glen is tellin' ya you can heal thyself. \nHI What do I gotta do? \nGLEN Well you just gotta broaden your mind a little bit. I mean say I asked you, what do you think about Dot? \nHI (puzzled) Fine woman you got there. \nGlen is eyeing him shrewdly. \nGLEN Okay. Now it might not look like it, but lemme tell you something: She's a hellcat. \nHI That right? \nGLEN T-I-G-E-R. \nHI But what's that got to do with- \nGLEN Don't rush me! \nHe stops walking. Hi stops also, looking at Glen, Still puzzled. Glen lays a companionable hand on his shoulder. \nGLEN Now the thing about Dot is, she thinks- and she's told me this- \nHe looks around as if to make sure they are not being overheard. His tone is confidential. \nGLEN ...she thinks... you're cute. \nHi looks suspiciously at Glen's hand on his shoulder. \nHI ...Yeah...? \nGlen nods energetically: \nGLEN I'm crappin' you negative! And I could say the same about Ed! \nThrough tightly clenched teeth: \nHI What're you talkin' about, Glen? \nGLEN What'm I talkin' about?!  I'm talkin' about sex, boy! What the hell're you talkin' about?! You know, \"L'amour\"?! I'm talkin' me'n Dot are Swingers! As in \"to Swing\"! Wife-swappin'! What they call nowadays Open Marriage! \nBeaming, he takes his hand off Hi's shoulder and spreads his arms. \nGLEN I'm talkin' about the Sex Revolution! I'm talkin' about- \nBACK TO ED \nAs the siren is growing louder. Under her breath: \nED That son-of-a-bitch. \nShe unstraps herself and gets out of the car. \nINT. STORE \nTwo-shot of Hi and the CASHIER, who is stuffing bills into a grocery bag. Beyond them we can see Ed, outside, circling the front of the car. \nHer shout is muffled through the glass: \nED You son-of-a-bitch! \nWith this Hi notices her. He turns to the Cashier. \nHI Better hurry it up. I'm in dutch with the wife. \nBut Ed is already getting into the driver's seat of the car. \nBACK TO ED \nAs she slams the car door shut. The siren is quite loud now. \nED That son-of-a-bitch. Hang on, pumpkin. \nThe car squeals out of the lot. \nWIDE SHOT THE STREET \nThe squad car tops a rise to bounce into view, its siren wailing. \nBACK TO THE STORE \nHi bursts out the door, still wearing the stocking. The carton of Huggies is still tucked under one arm. \nBellowing hopefully after his departing car: \nHI Honey! \nWe hear the SMACK-CRACK of a gunshot and glass impact, but the approaching squad car is still too far down the block to have been the source. \nHi looks around the parking lot, bewildered. \nThe wailing siren is becoming painfully loud. \nHi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store, where a bullet pock mars the glass. \nHIS POV \nThrough the glass we see the pimply young Cashier with the paper 7-Eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight down his huge .44 Magnum for another shot. The gun is so big he uses both hands to heft it. \nSMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass. \nHi is off and running. \nThe squad car is screeching into the lot. An officer tumbles out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped. He rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and takes up a half-kneeling shooting stance. \nAt the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7- Eleven with his gun. \nThe two bang away at Hi's retreating figure - the Policeman's revolver popping, the Cashier's Magnum booming. \nWe hear the Policeman who is still in the car drawling over its loudspeaker: \nSPEAKER Halt. It's a police warning, son. Put those groceries down and turn yourself in. \nTRACKING ON HI \nLegs pumping, panty hose still over his head, its unused leg streaming behind him like an aviator's scarf. The gun is tucked into his belt; the Huggies are tucked securely under his arm. \nBehind him we can see the OFFICER and the Cashier squeeze off another couple shots, and then the policeman piles back into the squad car. \nED'S CAR \nDriving. She hears distant gunshots. \nED That son of a bitch... Hold on, Nathan. We're gonna go pick up Daddy. \nShe hangs a vicious U-turn. \nTRACKING ON HI \nHuffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies. \nThe cop car careens onto the street in the background, its siren wailing. \nThe PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window, one hand gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun at Hi, shooting away. \nBullets whizz past. \nSuddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward, out from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet. Still running, Hi reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, tips it - loses it. He overruns it a couple steps before he can bring himself up short. \nHe turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING - bullets chew up the road near his hand. \nLeaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured yard. \nThe police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him around the corner, the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker: \nSPEAKER That's private property, son. Come back out to the street and reveal yourself to Officer Steensma and Officer Scott - that's me. \nYARD \nHi vaults a fence to land in the backyard. \nRoaring up the new street, they are now directly in the path of the oncoming police car, its siren wailing, barreling straight at them. \nStill screaming, the Driver leans into another hard right. \nWind is whistling in through where the windshield used to be. \nTwo wheels hop curb as the car skids into the new street, fishtails, and roars away. \nED'S CAR \nShe hears dogs, siren, squealing brakes on an adjacent street. \nED Hold on Nathan, we'll take a shortcut. \nShe gives the wheel a hard right turn. \nBut there is no cross street. The car hops the curb and roars up someone's nicely tended front yard, heading for the gap between this house and the one next door. \nPOLICE CAR \nRecovered and turned around from its near collision with the SCREAMING; Driver, the squad car is now squealing onto the street the Screamer swerved on to - resuming pursuit. \nAs the police car roars down the street, Ed's car appears from between two houses behind it, bounces down the front yard to the street and follows the police. \nSCREAMER'S PICKUP \nRaking two-shot of Hi and the Screamer. Hi is looking back over his shoulder at the pursuing police. \nDesperately pleading: \nSCREAMER Can I stop now? \nHi looks forward. \nHIS POV \nThey are rushing toward an imposing colonial house planted at the end of the dead-end street. \nBACK TO HI \nHI Maybe you better. \nCLOSE SHOT BRAKE PEDAL \nStepped on hard. The brakes scream. \nEXT. CAR \nAs the car squeals to a halt Hi is catapulted through where the windshield used to be, tumbling over the hood onto the front lawn. \nHe rolls to his feet and, as he runs up the lawn, calls back over his shoulder: \nHI Thank you. \nINTO THE HOUSE \nWe are tracking behind Hi as he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door. \nStill tracking behind him as he runs through the living room. \nA middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV. They look up as Hi rushes by. \nHi plunges down a staircase. As he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock. \nHe emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping-pong. He runs out the back door. \nTRACKING WITH THE POLICEMAN \nAs he runs into the house. \nAs he runs through the living room we catch a glimpse of the middle-aged couple gaping at him. \nOFFICER STEENSMA plunges down the stairs. \nTRACKING ON HI \nOutdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side. \nBACK TO THE HOUSE \nAs a pack of dogs thunders in. The lead Doberman with chain and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs. \nThe dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs. As they hit the rec room the thunder of their feet turns into the clatter of nails on tile. \nINT. SUPERMARKET \nAs Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something. \nHe turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run. \nHe emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires. \nHi keeps running. \nThe Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace with Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. \nHi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the Policeman. He runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store. \nThe pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap. \nHi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle. \nBANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. The Policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle; he aims once again. \nHi plunges down the next lane but is brought up short as KA- BOOM! five jars of applesauce explode in front of him. \nGALE Well ma'am... we sure didn't mean to influence anyone. \nEVELLE And if we did, we apologize. \nEd is unmoved. \nED I'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see about some shots for the baby. When I come back you better be gone or I'll kick you out myself. \nShe storms into the bedroom and slams the door. \nThere is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi. \nEVELLE ...What's he need, his dip-tet? \nHI I'm awful sorry boys, but when Ed gets mad, you know, when she gets an idea... \nGALE Well there ain't a thing to apologize for, H.I... \nHe looks at Evelle. \nGALE ...It seems pretty clear what the situation is here. \nEVELLE Yeah, I guess the Missus wants us to clear out. \nGALE Now H.I., you'll pardon me for sayin' so, but I get the feelin' that this- here... \nHis gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation. \nGALE ...ain't exactly workin' out. \nHI Well now Ed's generally a real sweetheart, I- \nGALE And as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised if the source of the marital friction was financial. \nHI Well, matter of fact, I did lose my job today- \nEVELLE Come on Hi. you're young, you got your health - what do you want with a job? \nGALE But look, I'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness. As you know, Evelle'n I never go anywhere without a reason... and here we are in your little domicile. We come to invite you in on a score. \nEVELLE A bank, Hi. \nHi is shaking his head. \nHI Aw boys, I don't- \nGALE I know you're partial to convenience stores but, H.I., the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery. \nEVELLE It's like Doc Schwartz says: You gotta have a little ambition. Why we just heard on the news how somebody snatched off one of the Arizona babies. Now there's someone thinkin' big. \nGALE And here you are sittin' around on your butt playin' house with a - don't get me wrong, H.I., with a fine woman - but a woman who needs the button-down type. \nHI Well now that ain't really any of your- \nGALE Just lookahere... \nHe is handing Hi a folded-up picture. \nEVELLE Picture of El Dorado, Hi. \nGALE Though the locals call it the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of LaGrange. Looks like a hayseed bank and, tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank. Except the last Friday of every financial quarter there's more cash in that bank than flies at a barbecue. \nEVELLE And guess what day it is tomorrow? \nGALE Ya see, H.I., it's when the hayseeds come in to cash their farm subsidy checks. \nEVELLE A-One information. \nGALE Got it in the joint from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of Dick Nixon's undersecretaries of agriculture. \nEVELLE He's in for solicitin' sex from a state trooper. \nGALE Ordinarily we don't associate with that class of person, but... \nGale chuckles. \nGALE ...he was tryin' to make brownie points with some of the boys. \nHI Boys, I can't - \nEVIELLE We need someone handy with a scatter- gun to cover the hayseeds while we get the cash. \nGALE Y'understand, H.I., if this works out it's just the beginning of a spree across the entire Southwest proper. We keep goin' 'till we can retire - or we get caught. \nEVELLE Either way we're fixed for life. \nHi is still shaking his head. \nHI Boys, it's a kind offer, but you're suggesting I just up'n leave Ed. Now that'd be pretty damn cowardly, wouldn't it. \nGALE Would it?  Think about it, H.I. Seems to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin' her any good. And y'ain't bein' true to your own nature. \nThe camera has floated in to a close shot of Hi, staring glumly at GALE. \nTRACKING ON MOTORCYCLE NIGHT \nFollowing it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and fender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. Flame is boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars. \nHIGHER TRACKING SHOT \nFrom behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night. With the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left, searching. With a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks right, still searching. \nHe banks into a turn. \nEXT. TRAILER \nLOW WIDE TRACKING SHOT \nBehind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures. \nTRACKING ON THE MAILED HAND \nSwinging as he walks, the Biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot from no apparent source-either sleight-of-hand or magic. \nTHE OTHER HAND \nSimilarly producing a long wooden match. \nDISCOLORED TEETH \nBiting down on the cigar. \nHAND \nDragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar. \nThe match erupts into roaring flame. \nCIGAR \nCrackling as it is lit. \nDOOR \nReading \"Executive Offices.\" The mailed fist pushes it open. \nPEBBLED GLASS DOOR \nFrom the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass is a backwards Nathan Arizona. \nThere is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices. \nSECRETARY'S VOICE I'm sorry, Mr. Arizona, he just barged in... \nThe door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle- aged secretary hanging at his elbow. \nSECRETARY'S VOICE ...Should I call Dewayne? \nNathan is staring toward his desk. \nNATHAN Hell no, why wake the security guard. I'll take care a this. \nThe secretary leaves. \nNATHAN'S POV \nThe Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. \nHis head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him. \nBACK TO NATHAN \nEyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction. \nBIKER \nNo reaction. His head continues to bob and duck. \nBACK TO NATHAN \nCircling the Biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk. \nHIS POV \nArcing around to reveal the Biker's face. He still does not react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance. \nHis eyes continue to follow some phantom movement. \nWhen the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan, and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner: \nBIKER You got flies. \nHe finally looks at Nathan, and smiles faintly. \nNATHAN I doubt it. This place's climate- controlled, all the windows are sealed. Who the hell are you? \nBIKER Name of Leonard Smalls. My friends call me Lenny... \nHe takes a drag on his cigar. \nBIKER ...Only I ain't got no friends. \nNATHAN Stop, you'll make me bust out crying. Listen Leonard, you want some furniture or a shitbox, they're out on the sales floor. \nSMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head. \nSMALLS Nooo, I ain't a customer, I'm a manhunter. Ordinarily. Though I do hunt babies, on occasion. Hear you got one you can't put your hand to. \nNATHAN What do you know about it? \nSMALLS Wal, that's my business. I'm a tracker- part Hopi Indian, some say part hound dog. When some dink skips bail, crashes outta the joint, I'm the man they call. \nNATHAN Mister, I got the cops, the state troopers and the Federal-B-I already lookin' for my boy. Now if you got information I strongly advise- \nSMALLS Cop won't find your boy. Cop couldn't find his own butt if it had a bell on it. Wanna find an outlaw, call an outlaw. Wanna find a Dunkin Donuts, call a cop. \nNATHAN Smalls, first off, take your damn feet off m'furniture. Second off, it's widely known I posted a twenty grand reward for my boy. If you can find him, claim it. Short of that what do we got to talk about? \nSMALLS Price. Fair price. And that ain't whatever you say it is; fair price is what the market'll bear. Now there are people, mind you, there are people in this land, who'll pay a lot more'n twenty grand for a healthy baby. \nNathan is looking at him stonily. \nGLEN I'll pitch my voice wherever I please! His name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't Ed Jr.! But it's junior an right! Yes sir, it's Nathan Jr.! \nHi takes one step down holding out a calming hand. \nGlen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon. \nGLEN ...Stay away from me, McDunnough! \nHi stops short. Glen smiles. \nGLEN ...Sure, you're an awful big man when you got somethin' around to clobber a guy with! \nHI (softly) I ain't a big man. \nGLEN That's right! And now you're at my mercy! \nHe spits on the dirt in front of him. \nGLEN ...I'm your worst nightmare!  I wanted to just turn you in for the re-ward. But Dot, she wants something to cuddle. So it looks like that baby's gonna be Glen Jr. From now on! \nHi's face is set in rigid dismay. \nGLEN ...I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed... \nGlen is getting into his car. \nGLEN ...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him up. \nHe slams the door. \nGLEN ...It's either that or jail. Oh and say, that reminds me! You'll find a doctor bill in the mail in a few days. I recommend you pay it! \nAnd the car squeals off. \nHi looks back at the trailer. \nHIS POV \nA slat in the window blind drops back into place. \nBACK TO HI \nHe opens the door. \nINT. TRAILER \nEvelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms. \nHi moves toward Evelle. His teeth are set; he means business. \nHI What's goin' on here. \nGale steps in front of Hi. \nGALE You know what's goin' on, H.I. It's just business. Now this can go either hard or easy- \nHi gives Gale a hard push to get past him. Gale staggers back but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug. \nHi flips Gale. Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up and crashes back down. \nEvelle is dancing back out of Hi's reach. As Hi lunges for him the prostrate Gale grabs his legs. \nHi goes down hard. \nGale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against an overhanging lamp. Both of his hands fly up to massage the top of his head. \nTHOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale's unguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gut. \nHi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands. \nWith Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swings his hands up over his head. \nHi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. \nHi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. \nGale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. \nThe reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesn't stop the punch. \nIt connects with Hi's jaw. \nGale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. \nHi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. \nHi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face. \nGale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. \nGale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too- small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. \nClose shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and clutching at it. \nEvelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts. \nEXT. WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER \nAt the cut Gale's roaring drops out. We hear the chirping of birds and the laughter of children playing in the neighborhood. \nIt is a sunny day. \nBACK TO INT. TRAILER \nGale still roars. With a last mighty effort, he finally swings Hi off his body. \nGALE What's that, pardner? \nEVELLE He had a little accident. \nGale looks over. \nGALE Wuddya mean, he looks okay. \nEVELLE No, ya see... Movin' though we are, he just had hisself a rest stop. \nGALE Well it's perfectly natural. \nEVELLE (very excited) Hey Gale! \nGALE What now? \nEvelle, beaming, looks up from the baby to Gale. \nEVELLE ...He smiled at me! \nTHE SUN \nA huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame. \nAs we hear his footfalls on concrete steps, Smalls rises into frame, apparently climbing a stoop. The sun behind him throws him into silhouette; the extreme telephoto flattens him against the sun. Heat waves ripple between us and him, making his figure slightly waver. \nThe rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped off by a- \nINT. TRAILER \nCLICK. The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands in the doorway. The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet. \nThe room is a complete shambles from the fight. Sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light. \nAfter only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of paper. \nHe bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a soft grunt of surprise. \nHIS POV \nAt knee-height on the wall in front of him, \"FART\" is scrawled in crayon. \nBACK TO SMALLS \nAs he stands up with the piece of paper. \nTHE PAPER \nIt is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank. \nINT. CONVENIENCE STORE \nClose on a carton of diapers being set down on the check-out counter. \nEVELLE (O.S.) Know how you put these thangs on? \nWIDER \nEvelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man (perhaps the proprietor of this small mom-and-pop store) face each other across the check-out counter. Evelle has various baby purchases - the diapers, baby food, etc. - piled on the counter. The Cashier is ringing them up. \nThrough the open door beyond them we can see a strip of the parking lot. \nCASHIER Welp. Around the butt, then up over the groin area- \nEVELLE I know where they go, old timer. I mean do I need pins or fasteners? \nWe see Gale trotting past through the visible part of the parking lot, cooing \"Weeeeee!\" as he holds Nathan Jr. Up over his head. \nCASHIER Well no, they got those tape-ettes already on there, it's self-contained and fairly explanatory. \nEVELLE Uh-huh... \nHe takes a plastic-covered squirt gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter. He is looking around at the other impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons. \nEVELLE ...These blow up into funny shapes at all? \nGale is trotting by in the opposite direction: \"Weeeeee!\" \nCASHIER Well no. Unless round is funny. \nEvelle is pulling a gun out of his belt. \nEVELLE All right, I'll take these too. Now you lie down back there- \nCASHIER Yessir! \nEVELLE And don't you move till you've counted up to eight hundred and twenty-five and then backwards down to zero. I'll be back to check - see y'ain't cheatin'. \nThe Cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame. \nCASHIER (O.S.) You the diaper burglar? \nAs he heads for the door with the groceries: \nEVELLE Looks like I'm one of 'em. \nEXT. STORE \nAs Evelle hurriedly emerges with the two bags. Faintly we can hear the Cashier bellowing: \"One one thousand, two one thousand...\" \nEVELLE Get the door, will ya? \nGale is slipping the baby back into his car seat, which sits on the roof of the car. He starts doing up the straps. \nGALE He's a real cheerful little critter once he warms up to ya. \nSitting placidly in his car seat that sits in the middle of the road in front of the bank. \nWe can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching. \nAs we hold on Nathan Jr. we hear the distant booming of a shotgun. \nAs we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby, we hear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes. The screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail. The police car is apparently history. \nFrom beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion. As the explosion echoes and fades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine. \nLenny Smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. Framed against fire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us, and the baby. \nFROM BEHIND HI AND ED \nAs they top a rise coming from the other direction. We see the baby sitting in the middle of the street, and Lenny fast approaching from the background. \nLOCKED DOWN TO MOTORCYCLE \nThe extremely low wide shot, locked down to the speeding bike, shows us rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jr's car seat. \nWith a clank of chains Lenny's hand drops down into frame, palm forward, tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are almost upon. \nA tattoo on Lenny's wrist reads \"No Prisoners.\" \nREVERSE \nLow shot with Nathan Jr. in the foreground. \nHe is scooped up and out of frame as Lenny roars by. \nON LENNY \nRoaring along. He hooks the car seat over his handlebars. \nOVER HI AND ED'S SHOULDERS \nLenny is approaching. Under her breath: \nED What is he? \nHI ...D'you see him too? \nLenny is sawing a shotgun out of his back holster and leveling it at the oncoming car. \nLenny is sighting down the gun, swinging it around as he approaches the car. \nHI AND ED DUCK JUST AS: \nThe shotgun spits orange flame and the windshield explodes in. \nLenny roars by. \nLENNY'S POV \nThe baby on the handlebars in the foreground; the road rushing by beyond him. \nThe bike banks into a hard turn. \nFACING HI AND ED \nShooting through where the windshield used to be, cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt. \nHi and Ed are raising their heads. Facing forward, they do not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window. \nHe is sawing out his second shotgun. \nHi looks around, reaches and pulls Ed down beneath him just as: \nKA-BOOM! - The second shotgun roars and the back window spits in. \nAs Lenny roars past the back window he casually flips something in. \nLOOKING DOWN AT HI AND ED \nFolded over in the front seat. Below them something bounces into and around the leg well - Lenny's grenade. \nEXT. CAR \nAs the two front doors fly open and Hi and Ed spill out - Hi from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road, and Ed from the passenger side. \nON ED \nAs she dives for cover behind a parked car. Beyond her - KABOOM! - their car explodes and bounces, pouring black smoke. \nON HI \nThe explosion flings him to the ground in the middle of the street. \nTHROUGH FIRE AND SMOKE \nLooking up the street to where Lenny is wheeling his bike in a U-turn. He is not finished yet. \nHi flat on his back, woozily shaking his head. \nHe weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street. \nHI'S POV \nLooking down the length of his own body. His legs stretch away in a V. \nCrashing down from a wheelie, Lenny's roaring bike is almost upon him - aiming up the middle of the V. \nHI \nHe rolls. As the bike is roaring by: \nClosing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley. A plank swings into frame, straight at the camera. \nREVERSE \nMatching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lenny's face. \nLenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him. \nTHE BIKE \nRiderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses. \nHI AND ED \nLenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods encouragement to Ed. \nHI Run along now, honey. \nLenny is reaching back to throw his knife. \nHi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as - the knife is thrown. \nIt thunks into the plank, piercing it through. \nHi backs up, swinging the knife - studded plank to make Lenny keep his distance. \nTRACKING BEHIND LENNY'S SHOULDER \nAs he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder. \nLENNY'S HAND \nAs the free chain drops down into his palm. \nLENNY \nSwinging the chain - WHOOSH WHOOSH - at the backpedaling Hi. \nTHE PLANK \nAs the chain snakes around it and rips it out of Hi's hands. \nLENNY \nGrabbing Hi by the shirtfront. \nLENNY'S OTHER HAND \nSwings down and brass knuckles appear on it. \nON HI \nAs Lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. \nAn uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back. \nA PARKED CAR \nAs Hi lands against it, banging his head. He sinks to the ground. \nLenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot. Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car. \nFROM UNDER THE CAR \nHi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape. \nBehind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. \nThe shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib. \nLenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car. \nHI \nStruggling to stand up. \nLenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug. \nHI'S ARMS \nCrushed against Lenny. His hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest. \nFULL SHOT \nLenny finally flings Hi away. \nHI \nLanding in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him. \nLENNY \nTired of the fight: He saws out both shotguns \nTHE HAMMERS \nOn the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back. He raises the guns to fire. \nHI \nThe end of the road. \nHe wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him - then stops, staring at: \nHI'S HAND \nHI No sir, that's who we saved him from. It's a long story. \nNATHAN Suppose you tell it. \nHI Well, sir, in a re-ward situation, they usually say no questions asked. \nNATHAN Do they. \nHi shrugs. \nNathan turns to put the baby back in the crib. \nNATHAN ...All right, boy, I guess you got a re-ward coming. Twenty thousand dollars... \nHe turns around with a thought: \nNATHAN ...Or, if you need home furnishings, I can give you a fine of credit at any of my stores. Fact, that's the way I'd rather handle it, for tax reasons... \nHI Well- \nNathan throws his hands up in the air. \nNATHAN But it's up to you. \nHI Tell you the truth, I think we'd prefer the ca- \nED We don't want no reward. \nHi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. \nED ...We didn't bring him back for money. \nNATHAN Well, we could work it that way too. \nED Could I just look at him a little bit more? \nShe stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. \nNATHAN Be my guest, young lady... but would you mind tellin' me exactly how you- \nEd starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs something to comfort her. \nNathan is studying the two of them. \nNATHAN ...You took him, didn't you? Wasn't that biker a'tal. \nHi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush. \nHI I took him, sir, my wife had nothin' to do with it. I crept in yon window and- \nED (still crying) We both did it. We didn't wanna hurt him any; I just wanted to be a mama. \nHI It wasn't for money or nothin'. We just figured you had more'n you could handle, babywise. But I'm the one committed the actual crime sir, if you need to call the authorities- \nNATHAN Shutup boy, no one's callin' the authorities if there's no harm done. \nHI Thank you sir. \nED Thank you sir. \nNATHAN Aw bullshit. Just tell me - just tell me why you did it. \nED We can't have our own. \nNathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs. \nNATHAN ...Well lookit. If you can't have kids you gotta just keep tryin' and hope medical science catches up with you. Like Florence'n me - it caught up with a vengeance. And hell, even if it never does, you still got each other. \nHI Sir, those're kind words. But I think the wife and me are splittin' up... \nHe indicates Ed with a nod of the head. \nHI ...Her point of view is we're both kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we ain't too good for each other. \nNATHAN Well ma'am, I don't know much but I do know human bein's. You brought back my boy so you must have your good points too. I'd sure hate to think of Florence leavin' me - I do love her so... \nHe clears his throat and turns to the door. His tone is harder again: \nNATHAN ...You can go out the way you came in... \nHe snaps off the lights. \nNATHAN ...And before you go off and do another foolish thing, like busting up, I suggest you sleep on it... \nHe has disappeared into the hall. We hear his voice receding: \nNATHAN ...at least one night. \nHIGH SHOT \nLooking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. We start to crane down. \nVOICE OVER That night I had a dream... \nEXTREME WIDE SHOT \nA beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of. \nIn the middle background of the extreme long shot two men are walking across the field. \nVOICE OVER ...I dreamt I was as light as the ether, a floating spirit visiting things to come... \nBACK TO HIGH SHOT BEDROOM \nCraning down toward Hi. \n", "test1_input": "The title of the film burns in: \"RAISING ARIZONA\". A building chord snaps off in a shock cut to: \nSUBURBAN LIVING ROOM EVENING \nTableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman. Florence sits reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. \nThe living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan and Florence, gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece. \nNATHAN (into the phone) Eight hundred leaf tables and no chairs?! You can't sell leaf tables and no chairs! Chairs, you got a dinette set! No chairs, you got dick! I ask my wife she got more sense!... \nTITLE IS SUPERED: \n\"THE ARIZONA HOUSEHOLD\" \nFrom somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry. Florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling. Nathan is oblivious. \nNATHAN ...Miles, all I know is I'm away from the office to have me some kids and everything goes straight to heck! I ain't gonna stand for it! \nAnother title is supered below the first: \"SEPTEMBER 17, 1985\". The baby stops crying and Florence's attention returns to her book. \nVOICE OVER ...Yeah, and if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his ass a-hoppin'! I'm sick of your excuses, Miles! It is now... \nAs he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m. \nVOICE OVER ...8:45 in the p.m. I'm gonna be down to the store in exactly twelve hours to kick me some butt! \nHe starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an afterthought: \nVOICE OVER ...Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona! \nAs he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. Another baby starts crying. Florence looks up at the ceiling. \nNATHAN That sounds like Larry. \nClose on the crying baby as Hi bounces it, gently but desperately. \nHI Shhhh! Shh! Nice baby... \nHe starts to lower it back into the crib. The crib is unpainted with the name of each baby burned Bonanza-style into the headboard: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr. Instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib, the squalling baby only sets off one of his brothers. Hi hurriedly lifts him back out. \nHe looks desperately around the room. \nThe room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters. \nThere are toys strewn around. There is one adult-sized easy chair in the corner. \nHi carries the baby over to the chair, stepping on and reacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way. He sits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the crib to deal with the second crying baby. \nHe lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it. This baby stops crying. \nAnother one in the crib starts bawling. \nHi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a rattle to keep it pacified. He reaches for the third baby in the crib. Sweat stands out on Hi 's brow. He is desperately chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled PTHUMP! \nHe whirls to look across the darkened room. \nThe first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner. \nLIVING ROOM \nNathan and Florence are sitting stock-still, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, another baby starts crying. \nNATHAN What're they, playing telephone? \nThey stare at the ceiling. \nNURSERY \nLoose babies are crawling everywhere. Hi is skittering across the room in a half-crouch, a baby tucked under one arm, reaching out with the other as he pursues a crawling baby across the room. \nHe hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air back to the crib. \nHe turns to look frantically around the room. \nThe other three babies have disappeared. \nThere is perfect quiet. \nHi goes over to the closet door, which is ajar, and swings it open. \nHe reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and pulls out a baby. \nHe returns it to the crib and freezes, listening. \nThe sound of a rattle. \nHe drops to the floor to look under the crib. \nWIDE ANGLE UNDER CRIB \nA baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the foreground. Behind him Hi, on his stomach, is reaching in to grab at his leg. \nHi is pulling the baby out, away from the camera, when with a plop! a baby drops onto Hi 's back from the crib above. \nHi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top of him. \nHe is straightening up, a baby in each arm, when he reacts in horror to something he sees across the room. \nHI'S POV \nThe hindquarters of a diapered baby are just disappearing around the corner of the nursery door into the hallway. \nLIVING ROOM \nFlorence and Nathan are staring at the ceiling. After a beat we hear a muffled plop! on the ceiling. A beat later, the bleat of the squeeze-me toy. \n", "test1_true": "They sound restless. \nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nThe floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward the camera in the foreground. Behind him, in the background, just rounding the open door from the nursery, yet another baby is making a mad dash for freedom. \nHi emerges from the nursery and, stepping around the background baby, trots toward the baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it the low-angle cropping shows us only his feet and calves. \nCLOSE ON HI \nPerspiring as he tiptoes the last two steps to the baby. \nHI'S POV \nThe baby and, beyond it, the stairway down to the main floor. We hear footsteps approaching. \nBACK TO HI \nHe scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the nursery. \nLOW-ANGLE REVERSE \nThe baby at the nursery door in the foreground; the staircase in the background. As Hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps climbing the stairs. \nHi's free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and out of frame just as: \nFlorence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs. \nShe approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock book. \nNURSERY \nAs Florence enters from the hallway door. \nWe track back into the room, on her, as she approaches the crib. Halfway there she freezes, staring, in shock. \nHER POV \nAll of the babies have been replaced in the crib but not lying down: They are seated in a row, staring back at her, lined up against the far crib railing, like a small but distinguished panel on \"Meet the Press.\" \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE CHEVY \nED'S POV of Hi approaching the car. He is shrugging and displaying a pair of manifestly empty hands. \nCLOSE ON ED \nBarely able to fight down her anger. Hissing: \nED What's the matter?! \nHi appears at her - the driver's-window. \nHI Sorry honey, it just didn't work out. \nHe is reaching to open the door but she slaps his hand away from the handle. \nED What d'you mean it didn't work out?! \nHI They started cryin', then they were all over me... \nHe is trying to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with all her might. \nHI ...It was kinda horrifying - Lemme in, honey. \nED Course they cried! Babies cry! \nHI I know that now! Come on honey, we better leave - \nEd is rolling up the window and locking the door. \nED You go right back up there and get me a toddler! I need a baby, Hi; they got more'n they can handle! \nMuffled, through the closed window, and very forlorn: \nHI Aw honey I - \nED Don't you come back here without a baby! \nNURSERY \nFlorence is holding one of the babies cradled against her shoulder. She is facing the hallway door; her back is to the crib and window. The baby, peeping out over her shoulder, is facing the window. \nCLOSE ON BABY \nLooking. \nBABY'S POV \nOf the window, as Hi's head appears in it. \nBABY \nLooking. \nHI \nLooking back, he holds a finger to his lips. \nBABY \nFlorence starts bouncing it, patting it on the back. \nBABY'S POV \nHi and the window bouncing up and down. \n", "test1_id": 552, "test2_input": "CLOSE ON ED \nLooking pleadingly at Hi. \nBACK TO HI \nFeeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes. \nHI ...Well... maybe that ain't such a hot idea either. \nGale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling. \nGALE (bitterly) So many social engagements. So little time. \nWIDE SHOT GAS STATION BATHROOM \nIt is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle combing their hair, now empty. \nWe are looking toward the door. The bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle. It grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. \nSuddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes. \nEXT. THE STATION \nWe are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground. The low wide shot crops the BIKER at his shins. In the background behind him is the gas station. \nThe Biker pauses for a moment, thinking or feeling. \nBACK TO INT. BATHROOM \nWe hear the rumble of the bike approaching, very loud. \nCRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in astride his hog, bright daylight streaming in with him to throw him into imposing silhouette. The shafts of light pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air. \nHIS POV \nFast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf under the mirror. \nBACK TO BIKER \nAn extreme close shot shows his nostrils dilating as we hear him sniff. \nHe revs the rumbling bike, stealing thunder from a far mountain. \nFRONT STOOP OF TRAILER \nHi, with Ed standing by, is just opening the door to a young couple. Glen is a short stocky blond man in his early thirties, wearing Bermuda shorts. DOT is wearing slacks, heels, and a scarf over her hair. \nHI Glen, Dot- \nAs the door opens, Dot hops up the stoop shrieking. \nDOT Where's at baby? Where's he at? \nFrom behind, Glen gives her an energetic THWOK on the ass. \nGLEN Go find him honey! \nDot spins and smacks Glen across the face with her purse. \nThrough clenched teeth: \nDOT Cut it out, Glen! \nHe reels under the blow. \nED (quietly) He's asleep right now. \nDot shrieks again, but this time muffles it with her own hand. She tiptoes into the trailer, hand to her mouth. \nGlen, rubbing his cheek, seems angry at himself. \nGLEN Shit, I hope we didn't wake it! \nDOT Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo? \nGlen at the top of the stoop, turns out to the yard. \nGLEN Come on kids... \nWIDE SHOT GLEN AND DOT'S KIDS \nA scad of children, ranging in age from two to seven, are crawling over Hi's car. One is beating on it with a large stick, another sits on the hood pulling back one of the windshield wipers, etc. \nGLEN ...Get away from Mr. McDunnough's car. \nTRAILER BEDROOM \nAs Ed and Dot enter, Ed beaming as they go to the crib. \nDOT What's his name? \nED Uh... Hi Jr. Till we think of a better one. \nDOT Whyncha call him Jason? I love Biblical names. If I had another little boy I'd name him Jason or Caleb or- Oh! \nShe puts her hand to her forehead, reacting to the baby as if she is about to faint. \nDOT ...He's an angel! \nShe hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded, then sneaks a look around her hands. \nDOT ...He's an angel straight from heaven!

He strikes the walls, furniture, various other objects with his stick, hollering \"Bam! Bam-Bam!\" with each blow. \nThe track weaves off him and onto Hi, who is bending down to pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator. He raises his voice to make himself heard over the din of all the children boiling around the room: \nHI Need a beer, Glen? \nGLEN Does the Pope wear a funny hat? \nHi considers this. \nHI ...Well yeah, Glen, I guess it is kinda funny. \nGLEN Say, that reminds me! How many Pollacks it take to screw up a lightbulb? \nHI I don't know Glen, one? \nHi looks down. \nOne of Glen's children, in a cowboy hat, is squirting a squirt gun into his crotch area. \nGLEN Nope, it takes three! \nHe starts laughing, then catches himself. \nGLEN ...Wait a minute, I told it wrong. Here, I'm startin' over: How come it takes three Pollacks to screw up a lightbulb? \nHI I don't know, Glen. \nGLEN Cause they're so durn stupid! \nHe laughs; Hi doesn't react. \nGLEN ...Shit man, loosen up! Don't ya get it? \nHi looks over at the TV, which the bam-shouting six-year-old is banging with his stick. \nHI No Glen, I sure don't. \nGLEN Shit man, think about it! I guess it's what they call a Way Homer. \nHI Why's that? \nGLEN Cause you only get it on the Way Home. \nHI I'm already home, Glen. \nThe kid in the cowboy hat is reaching up to slap Hi on the ass. \nKID You wetchaself!

Said, two Koreans and one Negro born with the heart outside... \nHe takes a sip of beer. \nGLEN ...Yeah, it's a crazy world. \nHI Someone oughta sell tickets. \nGLEN Sure, I'd buy one. \nHi is looking at another child who is just finishing off the T in FART in crayon on the wall. \nGlen chuckles, looking at his errant child. \nGLEN ...That Buford's a sly one. Already knows his ABCs. But I'm sayin', how'd ya get the kid? \nHI Well this whole thing is just who knows who and favoritism. Ed has a friend at one of the agencies. \nGLEN Well maybe she can do something for me'n Dot. See there's something wrong with m'semen. Say, that reminds me! What you gonna call him? \nHI Uh, Ed-Ed Jr. \nGLEN Thought you said he was a boy. \nHI Well, as in Edward. Just like that name. \nGLEN (not really interested) Yeah, it's a good one...

Glen looks around. \nGLEN Mind ya don't cutchaseff, Mordecai... \nEXT. PICNIC GROUNDS \nDot faces Hi and Ed across a picnic table covered with grilled hamburgers, rolls, green jello mold, cooler, etc. \nOne of the younger children sits in the middle of the table, occasionally taking a fistful of jello and flinging it at Hi. The two women don't seem to notice. \nDOT ...and then there's diphtheria- tetanus, what they call dip-tet. You gotta get him dip-tet boosters yearly or else he'll get lockjaw and night vision. Then there's the smallpox vaccine, chicken pox and measles, and if your kid's like ours you gotta take all those shots first to get him to take 'em. Who's your pediatrician, anyway? \nED We ain't exactly fixed on one yet. Have we Hi? \nHi sits stock-still with a stony face. \nED ...No, I guess we don't have one yet. \nDot shrieks. \nDOT Well you just gotta have one!

Everbody down on the ground! \nEveryone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An Old Hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up: \nHAYSEED Well which is it young fella? You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? Mean to say, iffen I freeze, I can't rightly drop. And iffen I drop, I'm a gonna be in motion. Ya see - \nGALE SHUTUP! \nPromptly: \nHAYSEED Yessir. \nGALE Everone down on the ground! \nEVELLE Y'all can just forget that part about freezin'. \nGALE That is until they get down there. \nEVELLE Y'all hear that? \nThere is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. \nGale is tossing Evelle a sack. \nGALE Wanna fill that sack, pardner? We got - shit! \nHe is looking in shock at the tellers' counter. \nGALE ...Where'd all the tellers go? \nThere is no one behind the counter. \nA muffled voice from offscreen: \nVOICE We're down here, sir. \n", "test3_true": "GALE I told you not to use m'damn name!

POLICE CAR \nThe camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs. \nThe car is approaching the townlet, its siren wailing. \nBACK TO THE BANK \nA teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags. Close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device. \nThe teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking; she shoves it into the sack. \nEVELLE All right now everyone, you know how this works: Y'all stay flattened for ten full minutes... \nHe is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who also picks up the baby. As the two are backing toward the door: \nEVELLE ...We might come back in five to check.

With a loud flat crack something detonates in the front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint. \nGale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, fear and incomprehension. Blue dollar bills snap and flutter around the inside of the car. \nThe car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, the inside of the windshield covered with blue paint. He reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield. \nHIS POV \nAs the blue paint is smeared away we see Hi and Ed's car parked broadside in the middle of the road. Hi and Ed are in front of it, Hi aiming his scatter gun, Ed a revolver. \nThe guns spit orange flame. \nHI'S POV \nDown the barrel of his shotgun. The car with the blue interior is swerving crazily at us, one front tire blown out. \nHi lets go with the other barrel. \nThe shot chews up the front grill, shatters one headlight and blows out the other front tire. The hood of the car flies open. \nThe car is squealing to a halt and Gale and Evelle pile out, still bellowing. \nGALE Goddamnit H.I., ain't we got enough to contend with? \nEd is running over to Gale and Evelle's car, throwing open the back door to look for the baby but coming out only with Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. \nEvelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body. \nED Where's the baby? \nEvelle points this way and that, in a state of confusion. \nEVELLE I think we left him on the roof of the... he must be back at the... \nHi and Ed are climbing into their car. \nGALE Let us come with you! \nHi and Ed are already peeling out. \nGALE ...He's our baby too! \nCLOSE ON NATHAN JR. \n", "test3_id": 554}

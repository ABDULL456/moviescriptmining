ALGREN But the emperor is the one signing the agreement. 
KATSUMOTO He has not signed it yet. 
He holds out Katsumoto's two samurai swords. 
ALGREN Is it worth it? ... just for these, 
KATSUMOTO I cannot live without my soul ... Can you? 
They regard each other. 
EXT.                      OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE                           NIGHT 
Algren leaves Katsumoto's gate and sets off on foot. 
EXT.                        TOKYO STREETS                               NIGHT 
As Algren walks, he becomes aware that he is being followed. Two dark figures lurk some distance behind him. After a few moments, he whips around to face them. They stand for a moment, then melt away into the shadows. 
INT.                      COUNCIL OF STATE CHAMBER                          NIGHT 
The Council of State meets in an august chamber. Many of the Council members wear Western clothes. Cigarette smoke billows. 
The young Emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his ceremonial role in the proceedings. 
Omura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the Council members turn ... and gape. 
Katsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed. 
OMURA (subtitled) Minister Katsumoto, you honor us. 
KATSUMOTO (subtitled) It is my honor to join again the men who are leading Japan into her glorious future. 
OMURA (subtitled) You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict regarding the wearing of swords? 
KATSUMOTO (subtitled) I read ever y edict with singular attention. 
OMURA (subtitled) Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber? 
KATSUMOTO (subtitled) This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred years-- 
OMURA (interrupting, subtitled) We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now. 
KATSUMOTO (calm, subtitled) . We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western "allies." 
Katsumoto slowl y looks around at the Members of the Council, but his words are addressed to the Emperor. 
KATSUMOTO (subtitled) Does Japan no longer need its patriots? 
Omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty. 
OMURA (subtitled) Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his country trapped in the past, or the man who would help his people into the future? 
KATSUMOTO (subtitled) A future with no honor, 
OMURA (subtitled) Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so they will live.    . 
KATSUMOTO And lining your own pockets in the process. 
They stare at one another with barely concealed hostility. 
OMURA (subtitled) Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask you to remove your sword, as this body has declared in its edict. 
Katsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt 
KATSUMOTO This sword serves the emperor, and only he can command me to remove it. 
Katsumoto looks to the Emperor, as murmurs fill the room. 
OMURA (quickly) Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is too pure and great to be heard in such worldly circumstance as the Council of State. 
One last time, Katsumoto meets the Emperor's eye. 
KATSUMOTO Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my sword. 
Omura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made. 
OMURA Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where you will be our honored guest. I think you will find the surroundings there quite harmonious. 
Guards with Mauser rifles move into position around Katsumoto. He turns to the other Council members. Looks at them. 
KA TSUMOTO (subtitled) Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done and feel what I never will ... shame. 
Omura nods to the guards. The guards lead Katsumoto out. 
EXT.                            LIVING QUARTERS                       AFTERNOON 
A BEARER is loading the last of Algren's luggage on the back of a rickshaw. Algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable MEN who followed him earlier lurking nearby. 
He resists the temptation to confront them. Instead he climbs into the rickshaw and it starts off. But a moment later, Graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing. 
GRAHAM Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave without even saying goodbye? 
ALGREN I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen. 
GRAHAM You sod. (trying to keep up) Christ, give us. . second here 
Algren indicates for the bearer to stop. Graham tries to catch his breath. 
GRAHAM You're making a mistake, I promise you. Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made his move -- he'll need you more than ever -- 
Graham stops, sees the look on Algren's face, realizes.

Turning, he exits. Mrs. Wyatt holds Elaine close. 
EXT. PORCH 
MED. SHOT. Helen stands on the porch in the sunlight. She glances back. Clay, his expression hard and angry comes out. He doesn't look at Helen but stalks down the steps toward the wagon. 
MED. SHOT ON WAGON 
STEVE What comes after Z? 
MARY That's the end of the line. 
STEVE (happily) Then I know my alphabet. 
MARY From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Clay comes toward the wagon. Helen stands on the porch. 
STEVE And that's tough, isn't it? 
MARY Without someone to teach you, it's tough. 
Clay appears behind her. Mary turns and smiles. 
MARY He knows his alphabet. 
CLAY That's fine. 
STEVE I'll bet I'd be reading in a week if -- 
He catches Clay's glance and his face falls. 
MARY Maybe Clay will take up where I left off. 
Steve gets some courage. He comes over to his brother and faces him. 
STEVE I don't think it's fair -- 
He pauses; Clay waits. 
STEVE Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody. 
CLAY Finished, son? 
STEVE (weakly) There's only two of them now. 
Clay moves past them toward the corral. Mary looks after him, then turning, motions to Helen. Helen starts toward the wagon. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Clay's horse stands saddled at the fence. He vaults into the saddle, turns the horse. 
CLAY I'll round up the horses. Throw that junk in the wagon. 
He rides off. Steve, delighted, runs to start loading the girls' things. Helen hurries into the scene. 
MED. CLOSE 
Mary and Helen. Mary smiles at Helen. 
MARY (happily) You were right -- a man has only so many no's in him. But he had me worried -- that last one sounded so final. 
Helen nods, looking at Mary as though in admiration. 
DISSOLVE 
EXT. WYATT RANCH 
LONG SHOT - the wagon, followed by the remuda and with Clay riding ahead moves slowly up the canyon back of the ranch. 
FADE OUT 
EXT. FOREST TRAIL - DAY FADE IN 
LONG SHOT - ANGLED WEST. The forest is fairly open, yellow pine, lodgepole and fir. To the West can be seen the bald red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. CAMERA PANS AROUND and ANGLES PAST. Toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen, lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen. 
MED. TRUCKING SHOT 
ANGLED PAST Steve. Steve has a copy of Leslie's Weekly open on the pommel. Helen lies full length in the wagon bed, occupying herself by giving herself a manicure with an orange stick. 
STEVE It's a lot tougher than I figured. Knowin' my letters is one thing. But makin' sense out of words is harder'n trackin' weasel after rain. 
Clay glances over at his brother. Mary sees him watching. Their eyes meet. She smiles. He doesn't return the smile. 
STEVE -- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch! 
MARY There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see. 
He sighs and scowls down at the page. He puts his finger on a word and starts to spell it out. 
STEVE U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that? 
MARY Unicorn -- a kind of animal -- 
STEVE What do they look like? 
MARY Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead. 
STEVE Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada? 
MARY No.

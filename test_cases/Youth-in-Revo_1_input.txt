SAILOR #1 So he owes us nine hundred dollars. 
NICK Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him. 
SAILOR #1 That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note. Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE. 
NICK I like it. Very to the point. Well... See you guys this afternoon! The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door... 
LEFTY (V.O.) I might have to kill myself. 
EXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY 
In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes. 
NICK (V.O.) I hope you have a good reason. Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars. 
LEFTY My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy. 
NICK I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological warfare. 
LEFTY Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache. 
NICK Maybe your just not wacking off enough. As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance... 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air. 
LEFTY (O.S.) So, I've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night. 
NICK (V.O.) In case you haven't heard, Lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft. 
LEFTY (O.S.) Then I look at this issue of Better Homes and Gardens that has a girl that looks just like Millie until it gets good and hard. I think it's starting to straighten out. 
NICK Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor? 
LEFTY (O.S.) Are you kidding? It would kill them to know that I even get hard-ons. 
NICK Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out. 
LEFTY (O.S.) True. What if I shove it up the wrong hole? Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction. 
NICK (V.O.) Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there. 
INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
JERRY Nick, you little shit, get down here! Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs. 
ESTELLE Nick, do you know anything about this? She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood. 
NICK Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission. 
JERRY You tell them when I was coming back? 
NICK Now why would I do that? Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence. 
ESTELLE What are you going to do, Jerry? 
JERRY I think I'll go get the Lincoln washed. 
ESTELLE You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars? 
JERRY Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right. And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door. They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps. 
NICK Oh, look. The sailors are here. Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses. 
JERRY Get rid of them! And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. Jerry bolts up the stairs. 
NICK Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right. 
INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS 
They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield. The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets. 
SAILOR #1 Sixty-three lousy dollars. 
JERRY That's my life savings! One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers.

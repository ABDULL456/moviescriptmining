INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT 
An accident case being hurried in from an ambulance. Paramedics, E.R. personnel and patients fill the scene. A bespectacled doctor in a white coat casually emerges from the crush and continues on into a hallway. 
ANGLE - DOCTOR 
This is no doctor; it's Jack Ford, one of the killers who shotgunned Storm seven years ago! 
INT. HYDROTHERAPY ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
DANNY, an aide, has Storm harnessed in a frothing whirlpool. 
INT. FIRST FLOOR/MAIN DIRECTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Several nurses chat and drink coffee at a clerical station. Ford comes up - nameplate, stethoscope, looking the part perfectly. We see him exchange a greeting, ask a question. One of the nurses hands him a clipboard with some papers on it. As the killer scans the clipboard -RUSS, the security man, approaches.

Ford averts his face subtly, continuing to study the list. Russ passes, with a greeting for the nurses -- and a (slightly unsure) nod for the killer. The killer nods back. 
SECOND FLOOR SUPPLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Andy arrives and goes about business. 
INT. THIRD FLOOR ELEVATORS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
A set of DOORS DINGS open.   Ford steps out. 
INT. COMA WARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Eerie ultraviolet; motionless forms; steady HUM of monitoring EQUIPMENT -- and the shuffle of the killer's shoes ... moving purposefully from bed to bed checking each chart for the right name. 
INT. THIRD-FLOOR NORTH CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Danny helps Storm out of the tub. 
INT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON FORD - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Checking the chart in the dim blue when -- a flashlight ray suddenly hits his face ... 
RUSS Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check everyone on the upper floors. (comes forward, no suspicion) Can I just get your I.D. -- 
PHHT!   Russ takes the SILENCED SHOT right between the eyes.   His body collapses in a heap there in the entry. 
INT. THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR 
Danny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors. Suddenly -- he freezes. 
DANNY'S POV 
He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall recognizable because of its security uniform trousers.

DANNY 
reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack. He leaves Storm, rushes forward to investigate. Storm strains to see. 
INT. DOORWAY TO COMA WARD 
DANNY (dashes up) Russ!   Russ, are you -- 
PHHT!   PHHT!   Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead. 
INT. CLOSE ON STORM 
Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight. 
Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative ... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall. 
COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD 
steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then: 
ANDY 
backs   through the double doors at the other end of the hall,   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's   carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full view   of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly -- Ford   hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready. 
Andy carefully   heads   that way -- the two corpses visible ahead and the   killer   poised to waste her. But she's concentrating   on the   overloaded tray, traveling closer ... closer ...   until   -- she turns off into the medicine room.

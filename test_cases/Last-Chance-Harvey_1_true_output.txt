HARVEY (over din) Yes. (beat) No. Not really. They've beaten it out of me. But its what i do - did. 
KATE (over din) Which is - was? 
HARVEY (shouts) I'm a composer. (stops himself) I write jingles. 
The vacuuming stops. They both look over, then back. 
KATE Wow. 
HARVEY That's about the normal response. 
KATE Anything I would of heard? 
HARVEY Yes. Uh...Uh... (long beat) Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before your time. 
KATE (smiles) No, go on. 
Harvey smiles a little sheepishly. 
HARVEY (singsong voice) You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem. 
Beat. 
KATE No. 
HARVEY It's a cigarette. 
KATE Oh really? 
HARVEY Forget it. 
KATE Ok. 
The vacuuming starts up again. They look over then back. 
KATE (CONT'D) (over din) Did you always want to write jingles or was there something more? 
Harvey laughs. 
KATE (CONT'D) What? 
HARVEY No, I just love the way you...you just cut through it. 
KATE I'll take that as a compliment. 
HARVEY You should. (beat) I was going to be a Jazz pianist. 
KATE Were you good? 
Beat. 
HARVEY No. Not enough. 
Harvey looks away. 
KATE I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend to blurt stuff out. 
Breaking from his reverie. 
HARVEY No. I like it. I like it... (beat/over din) ...Alot. 
Vacuuming stops. Beat. Kate looks away. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) It's a relief to find someone in this country who actually says what they feel. 
KATE Oh, haven't you heard?

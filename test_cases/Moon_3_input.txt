Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor: 
SAM Gerty! Get over here! Quickly! 
Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down the corridor. 
GERTY What happened? 
SAM Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look. 
GERTY There is no damage to the exterior shell. 
SAM It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh? 
GERTY Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside. 
SAM Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok? 
The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily repair the damage Sam has done. Finally: 
GERTY Okay, Sam. 
The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he immediately takes off down the corridor -- 
74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74 
Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit and scrambles into it. 
75   INT. DOCK                                                     75 
Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why is one of the Rovers missing? 
If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers. 
76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76 
Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is following a MAP on a small monitor. 
77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77 
Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER. 
Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly. 
ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil. 
THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER 
The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped inside. 
Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle. 
With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out -- Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI. 
Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover, his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back. 
He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans down even closer. 
CLOSE UP -- THE MAN 
Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film. 
Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself. 
WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER 
Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him to the parked Rover. 
CUT TO: 
78   INT. DOCK -- A FEW MINUTES LATER                             78 
Sam drives the Rover into the Dock, flies out and removes his space helmet, screaming:

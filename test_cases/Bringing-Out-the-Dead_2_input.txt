MARY That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside. 
Larry jumps theatrically out of the ambulance, swings the mop wildly over his head: 
LARRY That's it! I can't do it anymore! 
Mary laughs once, less than a second. She notices blood stains on Frank's shirt: 
MARY That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he? 
FRANK Yes. 
MARY He's dead, huh? 
FRANK Yes. 
MARY (pause) I think this place stinks. 
FRANK Our Lady of Misery. 
MARY Did you see my father? 
FRANK No. 
MARY It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me. 
FRANK He's working a double shift. 
MARY Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean? 
He does. 
MARY (CONT'D) My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance. 
FRANK She should go home. 
MARY I'd take her, but then who would stay here? 
Frank looks at her, trying to say the right thing. He notices Mrs. Burke coming from inside. 
FRANK Here she is. 
Mrs. Burke, dazed, steps out. They join her. 
MRS. BURKE It wasn't him. 
MARY You saw him? 
MRS. BURKE They showed me someone. It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband. 
FRANK Mrs. Burke, please, they'll take care of him. You should go home now. 
MRS. BURKE I should know my own husband. They wouldn't let me see him. 
She drifts away. Frank speaks to Mary: 
FRANK Larry and I'll drop her back home. Help me get her to the ambulance. 
MRS. BURKE You want some coffee? I have some apple sauce cake too. 
They walk Mrs. Burke to 13 Zebra. 
MARY Thank you.

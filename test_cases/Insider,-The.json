{"test1_input": "INT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - EARLY EVENING \nLOWELL (OVER) Have you always lived in Louisville? \nBrilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in the middle of the large room... \nWIGAND Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to consult about? \nA sudden KNOCK on the door... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (turns, suspicious) Who's that? \nLOWELL (wry) That's room service.  They usually knock first. (calls) Come on in...  Over here, please. \nRoom Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand... Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away. \nLOWELL (cont'd) Thank you. \nAnd the Waiter leaves... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) (pouring) How do you like your coffee?  Black? \nWIGAND Black, black... \nLowell gives him his cup of coffee. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Look, I really don't have that much time... \nLOWELL (nods) Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...? \nWIGAND Like what?  Your sign? \nLowell smiles. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) I know what I have to know. \nLOWELL Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way. \nWIGAND (abruptly) How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS? \nLowell looks at him, he does his homework... \nLOWELL I still do the tough stories.  \"60 Minutes\" reaches a lot of people. \nWigand's quiet, measuring him. \nWIGAND (after a beat) Let me see the documents... \nLowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a different heading, consults a chart... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for Philip Morris.  Burn rates...ignition propensity...things of this nature. (after a beat) I could very easily explain this to you in layman's terms, because it's from another company... \nHe puts the papers down... \nWIGAND (cont'd) ...but that's as far as I go... \nLOWELL Far as you go where? \nWIGAND (a beat) This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else. \nAnd Lowell knows something else is going on here... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (meaning Philip Morris documents) I signed a confidentiality agreement.  I honor agreements... \nA lot more is going on here...  Lowell nods, a good reporter... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman? \nLOWELL Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do...but I don't take that seriously. (after a beat) Where do you work? \nWIGAND Did work. \nLOWELL (fast) Did work. \nWIGAND (the bottom line) How much would I get paid? \nLOWELL That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs.  But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand. \nWigand nods \"Okay.\" \nWIGAND Should I just take the documents now? \n", "test1_true": "He turns to leave...  Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand momentarily slows... \nWIGAND I worked as the head of Research and Development for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.  I was a Corporate Vice President.  Mr. Bergman... \nAnd he goes out the door...  Lowell's still.  Wigand's job title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across the street... \nINT. CBS, A SCREENING ROOM - DAY \nMIKE WALLACE (on screen) \"President Assad of Syria said that difficult obstacles remain but that his country, quote, 'looks forward to a great, long peace with Israel.'\" \nTAIL LEADER.  THEN BLACK.  Suddenly lights come on. Executive Producer DON HEWITT is suddenly on his feet.  A veritable dervish, in constant motion... \nDON HEWITT (kissing Mike) It's a Peabody, Mike.  When you're dead and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're gonna remember you for... \nMike, used to him, ignores him, getting up, turning to leave, Hewitt on his tail...while... \nLOWELL (to his Editor) ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi... \nMIKE WALLACE You eating with us? \nLOWELL Yeah. \nMIKE WALLACE Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door... \nAnd Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them. The eye contact on the way out says there's something important he needs to tell her... \nEXT. CBS - DAY \nThere's a blast of NOISE.  The City.  Lowell, Wallace, Hewitt, Debbie, enter from the CBS lobby, moving through the reflections.  Lowell is about to say something to Debbie, but BILL FELLING, Evening News' Assignment Editor, coming the other way... \nLOWELL Debbie... \nFELLING Hey, Lowell. \nMidstream, fast: \nLOWELL Oh, Bill...  Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch.  You want it for the Evening News? \nFELLING What about you, you got a crew already? \nLOWELL I'm gonna do a follow-up. \nFELLING Okay. (leaves) \nLOWELL Catch ya' later. \nEXT. 53RD STREET, NEW YORK - DAY \nLowell, crossing... \nLOWELL Debbie... \nAnd, now, as they cross Madison... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) (to Debbie; finally) I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.  Boundaries of their constraint.  Kentucky state law about.  I want you to drop everything. \nDEBBIE DELUCA (cuts in) Okay. \nHewitt stops to buy a newspaper.  He doesn't have change, Debbie does. \nEXT. 55TH STREET (WESTBOUND), NEW YORK - DAY \nAnd Mike, Lowell and Don bang into Michael's restaurant.  We SEE them through the glass, being greeted, people shaking their hands, escorted by the maitre d' to their table as... \nINT. THE BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING, MAIN LOBBY, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nMeanwhile, it's static.  Still, frozen.  Jeffrey sits in the RECEPTION AREA of The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company headquarters.  Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on tables.  A dark quiet.  The hush of big business.  Standing in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators, is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and lapel microphone... \nUNIFORMED SECURITY (to Wigand) Mr. Wigand, you can go up now... \nHe gets up, crossing to an elevator. \nINT. THOMAS SANDEFUR'S OFFICE, BROWN & WILLIAMSON - DAY \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR (re:  his distraction) Sorry.  I'm accepting an award from the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.  It's going to kill the rest of my day. \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales figures.  Dark pouches are under his eyes.  He doesn't look up.  He doesn't look healthy.  We're in a luxurious office with a view of Louisville.  Jeffrey is waiting in a chair. Sandefur is Brown & Williamson's CEO.  Two LAWYERS, their briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch. Their jackets are off.  They wear expensive shirts. \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR (cont'd) (finishing; looking up at Jeffrey) So.  You had a chance to play golf? \nSurprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his salesman's sunny manners.  He has a mellifluous Georgia accent... \n", "test1_id": 2688, "test2_input": "She nods, studying him.  They get up. \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nThe house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey comes down the stairs... \nWIGAND That's it... \nAnd it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome... \nLIANE (beat) That's where our babies were born... Debbie took her first steps, right there...in the grass. \nAnd they're quiet. \nLIANE (CONT'D) I didn't plan on this... \nLiane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her. \nWIGAND Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can make this work for us.  Okay?  It's just...it's a smaller scale. Simpler...easier...more time.  More time together.  More time with the kids.  More time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day?  This is gonna be better.  This is gonna be better. \nAnd instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the empty house... \nINT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY \nWe see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country- western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees... \nEXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY \nJeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass... \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him. His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound. He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in the doorway... \nWIGAND Hey, baby.  What's wrong? \nBARBARA (terrified, whispers) What's that outside, Daddy? \nWIGAND Did you see somebody or did you hear them? \nBARBARA I heard them. \nWIGAND Where? \nBARBARA In the backyard. \nFast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and trousers... \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT \nJeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his \"office\" is now.  Unpacked boxes are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun. Barbara followed him. \nWIGAND Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you just sit up at the desk.  Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal, something like that?  You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara? You stay down here. \nHe keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs. \nEXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT \nIt's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner. \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT \nMeanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to follow after her father... \nEXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT \nMeanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him. \nWIGAND (to himself) You almost got your damn head blown off... \nThe raccoon defiantly bares its teeth. \nJeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops... \nMeanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door... \nJeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct, fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS... \nBARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Daddy... \nWigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it... EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions... \n", "test2_true": "He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her back inside... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) They're nocturnal.  You know what that means?  That means that they only come out at nighttime. \nHe locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE IN BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT \nThe Phone suddenly RINGS.  Lowell asleep, alone...  He gets it... \nLOWELL (sleepy) Yeah... \nINT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, HALLWAY - LATE AT NIGHT \nIt's dark, save a light from the living room.  Liane, in bed, seemingly sleeping.  And we see Jeffrey, just outside their door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  A man with no one to talk to... \nWIGAND (after a beat) Lowell...  Jeffrey Wigand... \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT \nLowell sits up... \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Is it too late? \nLOWELL No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the new place? \nINT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT \nWIGAND The new place?  New. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT \nLOWELL (intuiting) You okay? \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Sure. \nLowell knows he isn't... \nLOWELL You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. (beat) How are your kids handling the new house? \nINT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE AT NIGHT \nWIGAND Good. (beat) You have kids? \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) We have a couple.  One's hers, one's mine.  Everybody uses a different name. (wry) Modern marriage. (beat) How's Liane? \nWIGAND She's okay. \nHe looks at Liane for beat.  We SEE his POV in medium shot. Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Hold on a minute, Lowell... (after a beat) ...somebody...may be following me.  I don't know.  They came on the property... \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean followed you?  Did you call the police? \nWIGAND I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean, maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind game. \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Well, what do you really think, though? \nWIGAND I don't know what the fuck I really think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank doing it?  Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid?  Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know!  I don't fucking know. \nAnd it's quiet again. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT \nLowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears. \nLOWELL Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what happened. \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT \nAnd Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as... \nWIGAND Well, no, look...I mean, there was a footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not important at all. (beat) You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. (beat) So, what were you calling about? \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) You called me. \nHe takes another drink... \nWIGAND No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow.  So, what about? \nLOWELL (after a beat) Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to talk to you.  I wanted to hook up and talk to you.  About what we were talking about in your car. \n", "test2_id": 2689, "test3_input": "And he gives him a copy of it. \nDON HEWITT (CONT'D) He would lie about his whole life...? Who's going to believe him about anything he says...? (a beat, and the coup de grace) The Wall Street Journal's doing a major story and I think the Post.  You backed the wrong horse... \nHe turns and starts off along the hall.  As he goes... \nDON HEWITT (cont'd) (his parting shot) The version without his interview is going to air the week after next. \nLowell watches him walk away.  Debbie enters. \nDEBBIE DELUCA What was that about? \nLOWELL Get me Wigand. \nDEBBIE DELUCA Sure. \nLOWELL ...fuck is this?  Fuck! \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, HIGH SCHOOL, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (on the phone, upset) You never told me you were married before...that you had a daughter... \nAnd Wigand is in the phone booth at the High School...students walking by... \nWIGAND (outraged) Well, how is that any of your business?! That is not something that you people need to know! \nHis voice carries, a student looks over... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - DAY \nLOWELL (frustrated) Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know?  Since when have you become a media expert? \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWIGAND (upset) What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...! \nAnd he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing students stop, looking at him... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, CBS - DAY \nLOWELL Oh, my God. \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) (after a beat, lowering his voice, but contentious) You're not even on this anymore...  What do you care? \nLOWELL Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on the line here.  If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush.  Do you understand? Everything you say! \nWIGAND I told the truth! \nLOWELL Everything...you...say!  And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back!  Because you keep from me...what they can discover.  And they will discover everything!  Believe me. \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWigand's quiet.  He looks out the phone booth.  After some moments... \nWIGAND (meaning his first wife and their child, upset) ...I was young.  I was young...confused...  We didn't handle it the right way... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY \nLOWELL (after a beat) She sued you for back payments of child support? \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWIGAND She did not sue me.  We had a dispute over money...  I settled it, she dropped the complaint... (angry) Any other questions? \nAnd we'll go back and forth... \nLOWELL Yes.  Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics? \nWIGAND What? \nLOWELL Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview...where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...? \nWIGAND (explosive) What kind of shit is this?  I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team...okay? \nAnd we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat, who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration office, walking towards us along the hallways... \nLOWELL Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company? \nWIGAND ABC...? \nLOWELL ABC Telemarketing Company. \n", "test3_true": "The P.I. in the raincoat passes Jeffrey, now, and doesn't even glance at him... \nLOWELL That's the whole point, Jeffrey.  That's the whole point.  Anyone's.  Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made.  They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man.  Don't you understand? \nWIGAND (shouts) What does this have to do with my testimony? \nLOWELL That's not the point. \nWIGAND What does this have to do with my testimony?!  I told the truth!  It's valid and true and provable! \nLOWELL That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not!  Hello...? \nWIGAND I told the truth...  I told the truth. \nAnd Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.  The school bell RING snaps him out of it... \nWIGAND (after a beat) I've got to teach class.  I've got to go. I've got to teach class. \nLOWELL (undaunted) And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs. (a beat) I am trying to protect you, man! \nWigand's quiet. \nWIGAND (after a beat, the killer) Well, I hope you improve your batting average. \nAnd he SLAMS the phone down.  And as he stands in the phone booth, like a man in a glass booth, all alone... \nEXT. CBS BUILDING, ROOFTOP - DAY \nON the door to the roof.  It SLAMS open.  An enraged Lowell enters and walks out into the cold rain.  Like a prize- fighter, shoulders hunched against the cold, he buries his hands in his jacket pockets.  He crosses to the edge of the roof high above the city.  He's pissed off.  He takes out his cell phone.  He dials...  Lowell hears background NOISE... \nINT. WALL STREET JOURNAL - NEWS MEETING - DAY \nTwenty sub-editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear area...  One of them, a large man, is CHARLIE PHILLIPS on a cell phone. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS Hello? \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (cautious) It's Lowell.  Are you guys planning to do a piece on a former top executive in Big Tobacco? \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS You caught me in a news meeting. \nLOWELL Well, are you or are you not, Charlie? \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS You bet we are.  And I can't talk to you now. \nLOWELL We gotta hook up. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS Sure.  Where? \nLOWELL P.J.'s. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll be there. \nINT. A PHONE BOOTH, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nA busy New York street.  Light mist.  And we see Lowell is on the phone in a phone booth... \nLOWELL Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They looked in every corner of this guy's life...from a spousal abuse charge, to shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light.  It's Terry Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy, ruin his reputation in The Wall Street Journal, and then nobody will ever listen to what he's got to say about tobacco. He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing knocked down. \nINT. A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT \nA townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.  And we see a broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on the phone.  JACK PALLADINO.  His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND, sitting across from him on another phone.  They're Private Investigators... \nLOWELL To make it even a little more attractive, I don't know if you're ever gonna get paid. \nSANDRA SUTHERLAND Is there any truth to any of it? \nLOWELL That's a good question.  \"Is there any truth to any of it?\"  I doubt it. \nPALLADINO What's their deadline? \nLOWELL Soon. \nPalladinos exchange looks; she nods. \nPALLADINO Fax me the summary. \nLOWELL That's great, Jack. \nLowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter... \nINT.

{"train": "Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey. Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver. \nWIGAND (cont'd) Okay, baby? \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING \nJeffrey, Liane and the two Girls silently eating dinner, Deborah in a bathrobe. \nDEBORAH Can I go to dance tomorrow?  I'm better... \nLIANE ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after... \nWIGAND I can take her. \nLIANE Don't you have to be at the office? \nWIGAND (instead, getting up) Is there any more rice...? \nLIANE (nods) Yes, it's on the stove... \nHe goes into the kitchen, to the stove, seeing... \nLIANE (cont'd) Do you want more rice? \nDEBORAH Maybe later. \nLIANE How about you? \nBARBARA I'll take some. \nWIGAND Instant rice...? \nBARBARA Can I go over to Janeane's house? \nLIANE I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...? \nWIGAND Try the car. \nAnd Liane going outside... \nEXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - EVENING \nShe opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup holders.  She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take... \nLIANE Uh, what are those boxes? \nWIGAND I'm going to the store.  You need anything? \nLIANE What do you need at the store? \nWIGAND Soy sauce... \nLIANE Right now? \nWIGAND (meaning in the car) That's my stuff from the office... \nLIANE Why did you take your stuff from the office? \nWIGAND (simply) I didn't want to leave it there... \nLIANE (confused) I don't understand. \nWIGAND (matter of fact) I got fired this morning...  Where else am I gonna take it? \nLIANE Why?  Who said? \nWIGAND (specifically) Thomas Sandefur... \nLIANE (stunned, fearful) What are we supposed to do...?  What about our medical coverage; what about our health?  What about our car payments? The payments on this house? \nHe looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes... \nWIGAND (a beat, specific) There's a severance agreement...  It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... (beat) Sure you don't need anything? \nLIANE No, thank you. \nShe's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down the street. \nLIANE (cont'd) Jeffrey...! \nINT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY \nLOWELL ...everyone thinks Canadian Mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids, Mike.  They backed locals in Oka in a fight with Mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site.  They beat up protesters at Kanasake... (pause) Where'd you hear that? \nThe other phone on a nightstand rings...  A Woman in her forties, SHARON TILLER, enters, in a bathrobe, brushing her teeth.  She answers it... \nLOWELL (cont'd) (droll) Oh, someone took a poll?  \"Are all things Canadian boring...?\" \nSHARON (to Lowell) It's Stuart...he's in Mexico City... \nLOWELL Let me call you back... \nHe takes up the line...listening... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) Yeah, Stuart...  What New York bank? \nA young Man in his early twenties wanders in... \nJAKE Hey Dad...Sharon... \nLowell waves at JAKE, his son. \nSHARON (to Jake) No classes this morning? \nLOWELL Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch? \nJAKE I don't have to be there until ten- thirty. \nLowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper. And another young Man, in his early twenties, with long hair comes strolling in, Sharon's son, JOSIAH. \nJOSIAH Hi Mom, Lowell... \nLowell, still on the phone, waves to him. \nSHARON Hi, sweetheart... \nJosiah sits on the bed too, reading the back of the sports section Jake is reading...  Another line rings, Sharon getting it.  The Boys, used to them, get up, and leave... \nLOWELL (into phone) Will independent sources corroborate that? \nSHARON Hello?  Yeah... \nEXT. THE BERKELEY HOUSE - MORNING \nThe Boys coming out of the house together...  And seeing the BOX by the door... \nLOWELL'S SON (shouts back inside) Dad, you got a box out here... \nAnd they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door. \nLOWELL (looking at her itinerary) Let me see this...  No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM, BERKELEY - MORNING \nSHARON (into phone) I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow. \nLowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers. \nSHARON (CONT'D) Two p.m.  Great.  Bye-bye. (hangs up) \nLOWELL (reading) ...\"ignition propensity?\" (to Sharon) ...you understand any of this...? \nHe gives her some papers.  We see formulas...scientific data in tables... \nSHARON ...no...this looks like a table of temperatures...  Who's this from? \nLOWELL (shrugs) ...it's anonymous.  References to \"P.M.\" (motions) It's got to be Philip Morris, huh? \nSHARON I have to take a shower. \nAs he looks at the papers, Sharon goes into the bathroom... \nINT. THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AGENCY, CAFETERIA, WASHINGTON - DAY \nWe see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the wall...  His pager goes off... \nDoug Oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay phones and dials. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, DEN - BERKELEY - MORNING \nThe phone rings.  Lowell picks it up... \nLOWELL Yeah. \nINT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - EARLY EVENING \nLOWELL (OVER) Have you always lived in Louisville? \nBrilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in the middle of the large room... \nWIGAND Mr. Bergman?  What did you want me to consult about? \nA sudden KNOCK on the door... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (turns, suspicious) Who's that? \nLOWELL (wry) That's room service.  They usually knock first. (calls) Come on in...  Over here, please. \nRoom Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand... Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away. \nLOWELL (cont'd) Thank you. \nAnd the Waiter leaves... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) (pouring) How do you like your coffee?  Black? \nWIGAND Black, black... \nLowell gives him his cup of coffee. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Look, I really don't have that much time... \nLOWELL (nods) Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...? \nWIGAND Like what?  Your sign? \nLowell smiles. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) I know what I have to know. \nLOWELL Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way. \nWIGAND (abruptly) How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS? \nLowell looks at him, he does his homework... \nLOWELL I still do the tough stories.  \"60 Minutes\" reaches a lot of people. \nWigand's quiet, measuring him. \nWIGAND (after a beat) Let me see the documents... \nLowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a different heading, consults a chart... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study for Philip Morris.  Burn rates...ignition propensity...things of this nature. (after a beat) I could very easily explain this to you in layman's terms, because it's from another company... \nHe puts the papers down... \nWIGAND (cont'd) ...but that's as far as I go... \nLOWELL Far as you go where? \nWIGAND (a beat) This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else. \nAnd Lowell knows something else is going on here... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (meaning Philip Morris documents) I signed a confidentiality agreement.  I honor agreements... \nA lot more is going on here...  Lowell nods, a good reporter... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman? \nLOWELL Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do...but I don't take that seriously. (after a beat) Where do you work? \nWIGAND Did work. \nLOWELL (fast) Did work. \nWIGAND (the bottom line) How much would I get paid? \nLOWELL That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs.  But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand. \nWigand nods \"Okay.\" \nWIGAND Should I just take the documents now? \nShe nods, studying him.  They get up. \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nThe house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey comes down the stairs... \nWIGAND That's it... \nAnd it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome... \nLIANE (beat) That's where our babies were born... Debbie took her first steps, right there...in the grass. \nAnd they're quiet. \nLIANE (CONT'D) I didn't plan on this... \nLiane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her. \nWIGAND Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can make this work for us.  Okay?  It's just...it's a smaller scale. Simpler...easier...more time.  More time together.  More time with the kids.  More time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day?  This is gonna be better.  This is gonna be better. \nAnd instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the empty house... \nINT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY \nWe see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country- western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees... \nEXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY \nJeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass... \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him. His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound. He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in the doorway... \nWIGAND Hey, baby.  What's wrong? \nBARBARA (terrified, whispers) What's that outside, Daddy? \nWIGAND Did you see somebody or did you hear them? \nBARBARA I heard them. \nWIGAND Where? \nBARBARA In the backyard. \nFast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and trousers... \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT \nJeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his \"office\" is now.  Unpacked boxes are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun. Barbara followed him. \nWIGAND Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you just sit up at the desk.  Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal, something like that?  You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara? You stay down here. \nHe keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs. \nEXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT \nIt's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner. \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT \nMeanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to follow after her father... \nEXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT \nMeanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him. \nWIGAND (to himself) You almost got your damn head blown off... \nThe raccoon defiantly bares its teeth. \nJeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops... \nMeanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door... \nJeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct, fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS... \nBARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Daddy... \nWigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it... EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions... \nWIGAND ...okay. \nLOWELL (after a beat) Makes you feel good?  Putting what you know to use? \nJeffrey's impressed by Lowell's perceptivity... \nWIGAND How'd you know that, Lowell? \nLOWELL It's obvious, isn't it? \nHe looks at Liane in the next room, asleep. \nLOWELL (CONT'D) Hello.  You there \nWIGAND Yeah...  Look, thanks for talking.  I'm sorry I woke you up. \nLOWELL It's okay. \nJeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but the phone RINGS right away. \nWIGAND Lowell...? \nBut there's thick silence. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Who is this?  Do not call here!  Do not... \nThey hang up.  And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE. He hangs up.  And as he sits in the patch of light from a street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all night guarding his family... \nINT.  THEIR BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nAnd past Liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the trapezoid of light.  And as we DOLLY along her side, we come upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction to his raging on the phone.  She's far from \"OKAY.\" \nINT. A JAPANESE RESTAURANT, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT \nAnd we see Lowell and Wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional Japanese table in a private screened room... A traditionally-dressed Japanese Waitress waiting to take their order...  Wigand conversing with her in Japanese... \nThe Waitress formally nods, and leaves... \nLOWELL What did you get us? \nWIGAND Tempura... \nAnd Wigand drinks some more saki. \nWIGAND (cont'd) The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor...Marcus? \nLOWELL Marcuse.  Yeah.  He was my mentor.  He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s...and on me, personally. \nWIGAND Next to your father? \nLOWELL My father?  What the hell's that got to do with my father? \nWIGAND Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions? \nLOWELL You charge by the hour? \nWIGAND My father was a mechanical engineer...most ingenious man I ever knew. \nLOWELL Well, my father left us when I was five- years old.  He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew...  Let's get back to Brown & Williamson.  If you decide to go on \"60 Minutes,\" I got to know everything about why you got fired. \nWIGAND Why? \nLOWELL They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you.  I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? \nWIGAND (concedes) I drink.  A couple of occasions more than I should have. (thinks) I was cited for shoplifting once.  But it was a mistake... (hesitant, after a beat) I pushed Liane one time.  We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. (out of the blue) I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself.  And I don't like to be pushed around! \nLOWELL I'm not pushing you around! (after a beat) I'm asking you questions. \nWIGAND I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I?  I could be anything.  Right?  Anything worth putting on between commercials... \nLOWELL (honest) ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. (beat) To me?  You are not a commodity.  What you are is important. \nAnd he's begun to consciously or unconsciously \"sell\"... \nLOWELL (cont'd) You go public and thirty-million people hear what you got to say, nothing, I mean nothing, will ever be the same again. \nWigand doesn't react. \nLOWELL (cont'd) You believe that? \nWIGAND (skeptical) No. \nRICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Richard Scruggs... \nLOWELL ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not? \nRICHARD SCRUGGS (nods) That's right... \nLOWELL (after a beat) Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there. \nRICHARD SCRUGGS What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman? \nLOWELL Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection. \nMOTLEY It could work.  If it's public record, it's public record. \nLOWELL Yeah, and he's going to need legal representation. \nMOTLEY He sure as hell will. \nRICHARD SCRUGGS (a beat) Has he decided to go public?  Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know...  Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him.  So, is your man truly committed? \nLOWELL Well, actually, no.  Well, he's on the fence.  That's the point. \nScruggs and Motley exchange a look...  Motley shrugs... \nRICHARD SCRUGGS Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do... \nLOWELL Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him?  How do you want to do it? \nRICHARD SCRUGGS (no nonsense) It would be better if he called us. \nLOWELL Yeah. \nRICHARD SCRUGGS Alright? \nLOWELL Okay.  Thank you. \nAt this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of Jeffrey Wigand.  Scruggs disconnects. \nLOWELL (cont'd) Shit... \nINT. CBS EDITING SUITE, NEW YORK - DAY \nLOWELL (contemplating phone; to Debbie re:  show) Oh, we need cops on the street.  We don't need them on horses. \nDEBBIE DELUCA I don't know what he was thinking. \nLOWELL Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish? \nDEBBIE DELUCA Alright, alright. \nLOWELL Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself! \nTIGHTEN on mounted New Orleans police at crime scene, herding crowd. \nINT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, KITCHEN - TWILIGHT \nLiane cooking dinner, making pasta.  Ingredients, diced tomato, basil, are neatly ordered.  She's waiting for water to boil.  The kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette.  It's an idle moment.  She's dazed-out watching them. \nDEBORAH What are you cooking? \nLIANE I'm cooking pasta primavera. \nDEBORAH Oh, I love that stuff. \nAnd now she hears from the basement the BELL RING on Jeffrey's computer.  It's a tiny bell, incessant...  She crosses to the basement stairs. \nLIANE I'm going to have to go downstairs. \nINT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT \nLiane down the stairs, approaching Jeffrey's computer.  And she SEES an incoming E-mail icon - a large letter with wings - flying repetitively across the screen. \nThe bell RINGING is louder.  She calls-up the E-mail...  On the screen in large RED letters: \nWE WILL KILL YOU.  WE WILL KILL ALL OF YOU.  SHUT THE FUCK UP. \nAnd now Liane is shouting and running up the stairs and... \nLIANE Debbie, Barbara...  Debbie! \nEXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING \nWIGAND Yes.  Yes, I do. (beat) Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! \nAnd we hear Liane's voice from downstairs... \nLIANE'S VOICE (OVER) (upset) I didn't tell you that so you could just pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey! \nAnd we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's computer... \nWIGAND What's going on? \nLIANE I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the \"F\" up, they were going to kill you... \nAgent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them. \nEXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nWIGAND (outraged) You can't take that...  It's personal property...! \nFBI AGENT #2 (OR #3) We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat. \nWIGAND (after him) ...my files!  Personal correspondence... \nAgent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie, comes out of the house. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) ...letters to my brother...my will. \nHis shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out, watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She goes to him as he rises... \nWIGAND (cont'd) That computer has everything... \nFBI AGENT #2 You alright, Mr. Wigand? \nFBI AGENT #1 We need to take a look at your gun safe, Mr. Wigand. \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS, THE FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT \nLOWELL (interrupts) I'm telling you, your agents in that office are acting improperly!  Now, who are they trying to protect? \nAnd we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the Bureau (FBI).  BILL ROBERTSON.  He's completely distracted, focused on agent travel orders... \nBILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE (OVER) Let me tell you something, Lowell.  Look, look, look.  You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville.  I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX!  I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright?  When I get a chance, I'll give it a look... \nLOWELL (heated) You better take a good look!  Because I'm getting two things:  pissed off and curious!  Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire?  Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak? \nINT. BILL ROBERTSON'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON - NIGHT \nBILL ROBERTSON (beat) I'll give it a look. \nLOWELL You're getting my drift? \nBILL ROBERTSON I'll give it a look. \nHe hangs up. \nINT. DINING ROOM, THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nAnd we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotel's dining room, having ordered dinner. \nLOWELL So, is everything okay? \nMIKE WALLACE How are the rooms?  Comfortable? \nLIANE (to Mike) Yes, very.  You know, I enjoy your work so much...when you're talking to somebody, I always feel like I'm right there. \nAnd she laughs... \nMIKE WALLACE Thank you got saying that... \nLOWELL Do you think we could talk about the taping?  Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order... \nMIKE WALLACE Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal... \nLIANE (not sure she quite heard) ...taping? (beat) What are you taping? \nWIGAND I'm doing an interview. \nLIANE (whispers) An interview!  Do you know what they will do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry. \nBut she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move. \nLOWELL (trying to intervene) Liane, this is a preliminary... (after a beat) You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for? \nINT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE \nScruggs' office is decorated with watercolors of Phantom jets and A-6s as Scruggs takes off his glasses... \nCHARLENE He's on line three. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR \nJeffrey Wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with students... \nRICHARD SCRUGGS Hello. \nWIGAND Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand.  Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call... \nINT. SCRUGGS' OFFICE \nRICHARD SCRUGGS My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness. (beat) If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you... \nWIGAND When should we do this? \nEXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT \nJeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs inside... \nINT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT \nAnd he sees another Man is in the living room... \nWIGAND Who the hell are you?!  What are you doing in my house?! \nAnd he sees Lowell enter from the dining room... \nLOWELL It's okay, Jeff. \nSECURITY GUARD Mr. Wigand, you need to speak to... \nLOWELL (wry) It's okay.  You got your own security now... \nWigand catches his breath. \nWIGAND Lowell, I can't afford -- \nLOWELL ...they \"volunteered.\"  A friend owns a large security company. \nTALIFARO How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon Talifaro.  There'll be three of us on detail. \nLIANE (crossing through) I'm going to the store.  Please explain our new \"houseguests\" to your children. \nAnd Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living room and holds onto her father's leg. \nWIGAND I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi... \nLOWELL I heard. \nWIGAND I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition... \nLOWELL I know.  I'm going to go there tonight... \nWIGAND Did you have a good day? \nDEBORAH Yes, I did.  I had a great day. \nWIGAND Coffee, Lowell? \nLOWELL Yeah. (to kids) Want to play that game we were playing before?  You know, I think you got it up to five.  I was ahead of you. \nShe goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand, seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance connects with Lowell... \nINT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes, silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the sink. \nLIANE Please don't wash your hands in the sink. \nWIGAND Where should I wash them? \nLIANE Use the bathroom. \nWIGAND What's the difference... \nLIANE That's for food. \nWIGAND (smiles, wry) Yeah, great. \nLOWELL I heard about the Kentucky gag order... \nWIGAND I don't know what to do. \nAnd they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by.  He watches its slow progress... \nAnd Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside Lowell... \nEXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nMotley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign \"Temporary Jackson County Courthouse\"...into which Motley enters... \nEXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nJeffrey contemplating. \nINT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nOne TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is on his cell phone... \nTOBACCO LAWYER (into phone) Hold on a second... (seeing Motley enter; to Jr. Lawyer) Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not...? \nJR. LAWYER crosses to Motley. \nEXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY \nJeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then. it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically... \nWIGAND (severely conflicted) I can't seem to find...the criteria to decide.  It's too big a decision to make without being resolved...in my own mind. \nThey're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers... \nLOWELL Maybe things have changed... \nLong pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically... \nWIGAND What's changed? \nLOWELL (unsure) You mean...since this morning? \nWIGAND No.  I mean since whenever... \nNothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own answer. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) Fuck it.  Let's go to court. \nAnd Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat flawed, very courageous man... \nRICHARD SCRUGGS (to unseen staff) Dr. Wigand would like to leave now. \nAnd there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials, run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position. \nINT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY \nin the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus... \nEXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nSome of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out. A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the courtroom. \nINT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nThe tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on him. \nMOTLEY Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at that table over there.  I'm going to start as fast as possible.  I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay?  Let's go. \nMICHAEL MOORE Good luck, Doc. \nMotley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in. \nSTENOGRAPHER Please stand.  Raise your right hand... Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? \nWIGAND I do. \nSTENOGRAPHER You may be seated. \nMOTLEY You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under oath.  This is a sworn deposition. There's no judge.  It's not a trial. (understatement of the century) Will you state your name for the record. \nWIGAND (after a beat) Jeffrey S. Wigand. \nBaldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT. \nSandefur in CLOSE-UP states \"I believe that nicotine is not addictive.\"  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states \"I believe he perjured himself.\"  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says \"...the whole line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all swearing that.\"  And Wigand says off-screen with great emphasis \"Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT\"...and it cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word \"FELT\" resound and, then, he goes on to say on-camera \"that their representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew. We're a nicotine delivery business.\"  We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful... \nEXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK \nWe see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown Louisville. \nINT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT \nIt's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him. Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever. It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off... \nEXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him... \nAnd Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home... \nINT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty. He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in the silent house, the hero come home... \nINT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY \nWe're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER. \nHELEN CAPERELLI Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late. \nMIKE WALLACE No, no, we're fine... \nHELEN CAPERELLI Are you sure? \nAlso there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished. \nThey nod.  They don't need coffee. \nHELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D) Alright, I thought we'd get together because there's a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently, \"tortious interference.\" (beat) If two people have an agreement, like a confidentiality agreement, and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party can be sued for damages for interfering...hence, \"tortious interference.\" \nDON HEWITT Interfering?  That's what we do. \nLOWELL I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time.  This is a news organization.  People are always telling us things they shouldn't.  We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest...  And if it is, we air it. \nMIKE WALLACE After we corroborate it.  That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. (impatient, now) Anything else? \nHELEN CAPERELLI And \"60 Minutes'\" verification is exact. And precise.  And I don't think it would hurt to make sure you're right...on this one. \nDON HEWITT Why?  You think we have liability? What's the CBS News' position, Eric? \nERIC KLUSTER There's a possibility, it's rather remote... \nHELEN CAPERELLI But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've retained outside counsel to do exactly that.  On a segment, I might add, that's already rife with problems... \nLOWELL What does that mean?  \"Rife with -- ?\" \nHELEN CAPERELLI I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand. \nLOWELL No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him... \nHELEN CAPERELLI (cuts in) And, I'm told there are questions as to our \"star witness'\" veracity. \nLOWELL (trying to control his anger) His \"veracity\" was good enough for the State of Mississippi. \nHELEN CAPERELLI (historic) Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard...for everyone else... \nWhatever that means... \nLOWELL (wry) Well, as a \"standard\"...I'll hang with \"is the guy telling the truth?\" \nHELEN CAPERELLI Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid...the greater the truth, the greater the damage. \nLOWELL Come again? \nHELEN CAPERELLI They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose their information.  And the damages are smaller. \nLOWELL Is this \"Alice in Wonderland\"? \nMIKE WALLACE You said \"on this one.\"  What about \"this one\"? \nAnd Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a beat. \nHELEN CAPERELLI (familiar, seductive) If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson?  I think we could be at grave risk. \nDON HEWITT CBS does not do that.  And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?! \nLOWELL No, I'm questioning your hearing!  You hear \"reasonable\" and \"tortious interference.\"  I hear...  \"Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse.\"  I hear...  \"Shut the segment down.  Cut Wigand loose.  Obey orders.  And fuck off...!\"  That's what I hear. \nDON HEWITT You're exaggerating! \nLOWELL I am?  You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out.  To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He talks.  He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement.  And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth?  Yes. Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's not telling the truth?  No.  Because he is telling the truth.  That's why we're not going to air it.  And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets! \nDON HEWITT You are a fanatic.  An anarchist.  You know that?  If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show.  But oh, no, not you.  You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk! \nLOWELL C'mon, what are you?  And are you a businessman?  Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living... \nMIKE WALLACE Lowell. \nLOWELL (runs on) \"Put the corporation at risk\"...?  Give me a fucking break! \nMIKE WALLACE Lowell. \nLOWELL These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do...on the line! \nMIKE WALLACE Lowell! \nLOWELL What? \nMIKE WALLACE I'm with Don on this. \nAnd there it is. \nEXT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - AFTERNOON \nWe see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard... She turns, seeing him standing behind her... \nAfter a moment.  She knows. \nSHARON What's wrong? \nLOWELL They're killing the Wigand interview... \nSHARON What?! \nLOWELL They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone. \nSHARON (beat) What are you and Mike going to do? \nLOWELL I'm alone on this... \nSHARON (beat) Oh, baby... \nAnd the phone RINGS...  Sharon goes in the house to get it... She comes back out... \nSHARON (CONT'D) (after a beat) Jeffrey Wigand... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON \nLOWELL Jeffrey... \nINT. A HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nAnd we see Wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch in a hotel room.  And we see his belongings, clothing, some boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his world, are around the room. \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Jeffrey, how are you?  How's the family, okay? \nWIGAND There is - there is no family. \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean there is no family? \nWIGAND Liane has filed for divorce... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - LATE AFTERNOON \nAnd Lowell's dead quiet. \nINT. THE HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nWIGAND And, so, I moved out...  I see the girls a couple of days a week... \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (concerned) Where you staying now? \nWIGAND (sarcastic) Our favorite hotel, honey...  I checked into Room 930.  Odd choice?  Huh? \nAnd we don't know what he means by that... \nAnd he gives him a copy of it. \nDON HEWITT (CONT'D) He would lie about his whole life...? Who's going to believe him about anything he says...? (a beat, and the coup de grace) The Wall Street Journal's doing a major story and I think the Post.  You backed the wrong horse... \nHe turns and starts off along the hall.  As he goes... \nDON HEWITT (cont'd) (his parting shot) The version without his interview is going to air the week after next. \nLowell watches him walk away.  Debbie enters. \nDEBBIE DELUCA What was that about? \nLOWELL Get me Wigand. \nDEBBIE DELUCA Sure. \nLOWELL ...fuck is this?  Fuck! \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, HIGH SCHOOL, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (on the phone, upset) You never told me you were married before...that you had a daughter... \nAnd Wigand is in the phone booth at the High School...students walking by... \nWIGAND (outraged) Well, how is that any of your business?! That is not something that you people need to know! \nHis voice carries, a student looks over... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE - DAY \nLOWELL (frustrated) Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know?  Since when have you become a media expert? \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWIGAND (upset) What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...! \nAnd he realizes he's said it too loud, a couple of passing students stop, looking at him... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, CBS - DAY \nLOWELL Oh, my God. \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) (after a beat, lowering his voice, but contentious) You're not even on this anymore...  What do you care? \nLOWELL Jeff!  Wake the fuck up!  Everybody is on the line here.  If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush.  Do you understand? Everything you say! \nWIGAND I told the truth! \nLOWELL Everything...you...say!  And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back!  Because you keep from me...what they can discover.  And they will discover everything!  Believe me. \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWigand's quiet.  He looks out the phone booth.  After some moments... \nWIGAND (meaning his first wife and their child, upset) ...I was young.  I was young...confused...  We didn't handle it the right way... \nINT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DAY \nLOWELL (after a beat) She sued you for back payments of child support? \nINT. THE PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nWIGAND She did not sue me.  We had a dispute over money...  I settled it, she dropped the complaint... (angry) Any other questions? \nAnd we'll go back and forth... \nLOWELL Yes.  Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics? \nWIGAND What? \nLOWELL Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview...where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...? \nWIGAND (explosive) What kind of shit is this?  I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team...okay? \nAnd we see, unbeknownst to Wigand, the P.I. in the raincoat, who interviewed his ex-wife, coming out of an administration office, walking towards us along the hallways... \nLOWELL Alright...the ABC Telemarketing Company? \nWIGAND ABC...? \nLOWELL ABC Telemarketing Company. \nCLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from The New York Times, sitting next to Charlie. \nJIM COOPER Hey, Lowell. \nLOWELL How are you, Jim? \nJIM COOPER Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there. \nLowell looks at Cooper quizzically. \nLOWELL Really?  Hi, Joan. \nJust then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings. \nJIM COOPER Hi, baby. \nLOWELL Catch you later. \nCooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are alone in the crowded bar. \nLOWELL (CONT'D) When's your deadline? \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS Monday. \nLOWELL Push it. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS What?  Forget it. \nLOWELL It's a smear campaign, Charlie. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS It's drawn from a selectively circulated... \nLOWELL (cuts in) Oh, it's real selective...about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book. \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented. \nLOWELL And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face? \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so. \nThat's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone... \nCHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd) Are you all right? \nLOWELL Yeah.  Catch you later. \nINT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nAnd we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee... \nSANDRA SUTHERLAND Officer Murabchick? \nHe turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him. \nSANDRA SUTHERLAND (cont'd) Officer Muravchick.  How are you?  I'm Sandra Sutherland. \nPOLICEMAN How do you do? \nSANDRA SUTHERLAND Fine, thank you.  I'm doing a background check.  Mind if I sit down? \nINT. COURTROOM, LOUISVILLE - LATE AFTERNOON \nAn older Man is on the bench.  He's just recessed his court. As everybody streams out, going against the tide is Jack Palladino.  He approaches the judge, crossing to a side door... \nPALLADINO Your honor, could I have a word with you? You presided in a dispute over support payments... \nINT. A COFFEE SHOP, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nPOLICEMAN Jeffrey Wigand?  Yeah, I cited him. \nINT. EDITING ROOM, CBS - DAY \nDAN RATHER (on monitor) CBS is under criticism, because the CBS News program \"60 Minutes\" will not be presenting an interview... \nLowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a call as Hewitt enters. \nDON HEWITT What the hell are you doing? \nLOWELL What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm editing. \nDON HEWITT No, not that.  I'm talking about the Associated Press.  They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them that we were lying? \nINT. A BAR, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nAnd we see Jeffrey in a quiet Bar.  The television's on, the sound low, the midday news.  As Jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on TELEVISION.  In his LOCAL WORLD the impact is: \nLOCAL NEWSCASTER And in local news, WLKO Louisville has gained access to a five-hundred-page dossier on former Brown & Williamson research head Jeffrey Wigand detailing charges of spousal abuse, shoplifting... \nAnd Jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of him. \nWE'RE LOOKING AT MIKE WALLACE SITTING IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP ON \"60 MINUTES,\" ON A TELEVISION... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nAnd Jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel, watching the show... \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year, documents that appear to confirm what a former...\" \nAnd as we look at Jeffrey's face, set in stone... \nINT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...US Surgeon General and the current head of the Food and Drug Administration have been saying.  We learned of...\" \nINT. DON HEWITT'S HOUSE, THE HAMPTONS - NIGHT \nAnd Don Hewitt in his house in the Hamptons, alone in his bedroom, watching the show... \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public...\" \nINT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...that insider was formerly a highly- placed executive with a tobacco company...\" \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...but we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco, addiction and public health he might be able to offer. Why?  Because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for...\" \nINT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nMike Wallace is in his study, watching the show alone.  As we slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television... \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"The management of CBS has told us that knowing he had that agreement...\" \nAnd the look on his face says:  HE DOES NOT LIKE THIS. \nINT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT \nLowell silently watching the broadcast... \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"...if were to broadcast an interview with him, CBS could be faced with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit...\" \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nJeffrey, watching the show... \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes,\" from the interview with Wigand...) \"The fact is, we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and, of course, we cannot show you his face...  '...and your confidentiality agreement with...(blip) is still in force?'\" \nAnd all we can hear is an ELECTRONICALLY-ALTERED VOICE and the BLANKED-OUT image of a man... \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) \"Yes, it is.\" \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"So, what are they gonna do?  Sue you for making this appearance?\" \nWIGAND \"I would bet on it.\" \nMIKE WALLACE (on \"60 Minutes\") \"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers...\" \nJeffrey, motionless...  A man, no longer with a face or a voice...  And as he gets up, and quietly turns off the television... \nINT. MIKE WALLACE'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK - NIGHT, LATER \nWallace, hasn't moved, still in his chair.  He stares, ignoring the CBS programming, on the phone, making a call... \nEXT. THE CARIBBEAN BEACH - NIGHT \nLowell, walking up the sand, his cell phone rings. \nLOWELL Yeah. \nMIKE WALLACE You disappeared on me.  How long you staying? \nLOWELL (absurd) I disappeared on you? \nLOWELL No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone! \nINT. THE HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTHE HOTEL MANAGER (at the door, to Jeffrey, loud) He told me to tell you, to get on...the fucking phone...! \nAnd even he's surprised by his language.  And suddenly Jeffrey gets up, unlatches the door, grabs the phone from the Hotel Manager.  Wigand in the hotel corridor, Lowell standing knee-deep in the water... \nWIGAND (on the phone, angry) You manipulated me into this...! \nLOWELL That's bullshit, Jeff! \nWIGAND You greased the rails! \nLOWELL I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes.  I helped him to say yes. Alright.  You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all.  You got a mind of your own, don't you? \nWIGAND (running on) \"Up to you, Jeffrey.  That's the power you have, Jeffrey.  Vital insider information the American public need to know.\"  Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around. \nLOWELL (running on) I fought for you...and I still fight for you. \nWIGAND You fought for me...?! (running on) ...you manipulated me...into where I am now...staring at the Brown & Williamson Building.  It's all dark.  Except the 10th floor!  That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life! \nLOWELL (beat) Jeffrey, where you going with this?  So where you goin'? (quiet) You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey.  You think about that.  You think about them. \nCLOSE ON JEFFREY:  standing in the room with the blowing curtains... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) I'm running out of heroes, man... (after a beat) Guys like you are in short supply. \nAnd for the first time, Wigand smiles. \nWIGAND (a beat, wry) Yeah, guys like you, too. \nAnd the grave situation passes. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (after a beat) Where are you, anyway? \nLOWELL I'm on a leave of absence.  Forced vacation. \nWIGAND (a rare laugh, his sarcasm) You try and have a good time. \nLOWELL (droll) Yeah.  Yeah, I will. \nINT. THE CARIBBEAN BUNGALOW - DAY/NIGHT \nSharon's cooking across the room...  And there's just the sound of the ceiling fan turning. \nLOWELL \"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'\"  You know, you take the \"60 Minutes\" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call.  Maybe Wigand's right.  Maybe I'm hooked.  What am I hooked on?  The rush?  \"60 Minutes\"? What the hell for?  Infotainment.  It's so fucking useless, all of it. \nSHARON (a beat) So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else. \nLOWELL Free press?  Press is free...for anyone who owns one.  Larry Tisch has a free press. \nSHARON Get some perspective, Lowell. \nLOWELL I got perspective. \nSHARON No, you do not. \nLOWELL From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures. \nSHARON You're not listening. (beat) Really know what you're going to do before you do it. \nAnd as the fan squeaks, turning...  Lowell stares at Sharon. \nWE SEE SNOW IS ON THE GROUND. \nEXT. LINCOLN, MONTANA - DAY \nBetween two curved colonnades of SNOW-covered trees drives a rental car.  CLOSER, it's Lowell.  His POV spots a dirty SUV and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out- of-context mountain town.  His pager beeps.  He looks at it. He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the Moose Lodge. \nDEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) I've got Richard Scruggs on the phone... \nLOWELL Patch him through. \nRICHARD SCRUGGS' VOICE (OVER) Well, Lowell, you are not going to believe this... \nINT. A COURTROOM + ROTUNDA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY \nAnd we see the back of a crowded courtroom.  Richard Scruggs is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses, talking on his own cell phone. \nRICAHRD SCRUGGS The Governor of Mississippi is suing his own Attorney General...to abandon litigation against Big Tobacco... \nWALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) \"All of us did...there was this whole like of people, the whole line of CEOs up there, all swearing that.\" \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) \"Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT...\" \nAnd the PAUSE after the word makes \"FELT\" resound, and as it CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying... \nWIGAND (CONT'D) \"...that their representation...\" \nAnd Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking out the window through the curtain with the spill from the neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him. Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with... \nJIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Hello? \nLOWELL Jim, it's Lowell. \nINT. NEW YORK TIMES - NIGHT \nJIM COOPER Hey!  Where are you? \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) (doesn't answer) Remember that night at P.J.'s?  You asked me if we were sitting on something \"explosive\"? (beat) Well, we're not \"sitting on\" it. (beat) CBS corporate leaned on CBS News which yanked an interview we did with a top- ranking tobacco scientist.  A corporate officer.  They are trying to close down the story. \nJIM COOPER (sarcastic) You mean, \"60 Minutes\" is letting CBS corporate decide what is or is not news? (beat) What's Wallace think about this, or Hewitt, or...? \nLOWELL How prominent?  What kind of placement? \nJIM COOPER Oh, c'mon, Lowell.  This is The New York Times.  I don't know... \nLOWELL Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know...they will not air an interview. \nJIM COOPER Call me back in ten. \nLowell hangs up.  Re-dials. \nINT. DEBBIE DELUCA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - LATE NIGHT \nDebbie answers, intercutting with above... \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Debbie.  It's me... \nDEBBIE DELUCA Hi.

You've burned your bridges, man. \nLOWELL You ready...? \nJIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER) Okay...  About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision? \nNo answer. \nJIM COOPER'S VOICE (OVER)(cont'd) Lowell? \nLOWELL Did I tell you you were wrong? \nDEBBIE DELUCA ...front page.  There's a picture of Wigand.  Article's entitled, \"Getting Personal,\" by-lined to Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.  Wait, hold on a second, Lowell. \nDebbie hits \"call waiting.\" \nDEBBIE DELUCA (cont'd) Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see if I can find him.  Hold on... (beat; to Lowell) Yeah, Don's looking for you... \nLOWELL Good. \nDEBBIE DELUCA The sub-heading is, \"Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic.\" It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it \"the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower.\" \nINT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING \nEXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell. \nDEBBIE DELUCA'S VOICE (OVER) \"...a close look at the file, and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims, indicates that many of the serious allegations against Mr. Wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence...\" \nEXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING \nAs Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us, jumping into the cab... \nINT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY \nDON HEWITT The news division has been vilified in The New York Times, in print, on television, for caving to corporate interests! \nWe PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's office... \nDON HEWITT (CONT'D) The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us! \nLOWELL (shouting) No, you fucked you!  Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it.  The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti- capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination!  And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else...do you need? \nAnd Hewitt, looking around. \nDON HEWITT Mike, you tell him... \nMIKE WALLACE (simply) You fucked up, Don. \nAnd Don's taken off stride... \nDON HEWITT (recovers fast) Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like always, we'll be okay.  These things have a half-life of fifteen minutes... \nMIKE WALLACE No, that's fame.  Fame has a fifteen- minute half-life... (droll) Infamy...lasts a little longer. \nLowell looks at Wallace. \nMIKE WALLACE (CONT'D) We caved.  It's foolish.  It's simply dead wrong. (in his face, so there's no doubt) Now, this is what we're going to do. We're going over to Black Rock... \nINT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON \nJeff is in front of his class, teaching... \nWIGAND Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright, now, what we saw there was... \nINT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT \nTired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted- than-not airport. \nLOWELL (into phone) They cancelled the six o'clock. (beat) I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I should be home...9:30.  I'll see you then.  Love ya'.  Bye... \nHe hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it. \nMIKE WALLACE \"CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast our original story and our interview with Wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against us for tortious interference...  But now things have changed.\" \nINT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nA small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing \"60 Minutes\" and... \nMICHAEL MOORE (on television) \"...in my opinion, is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the American public in history.\" \nDeborah looks proudly at her father. \nWigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there, watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their father's hard-earned \"truth\" on television, we realize that of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about most... \nINT. AIRPORT LOUNGE \nAnd Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his \"60 Minutes\" double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell glances at him... \nUnbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually among them, watching his work. \nINT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT \nSharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far corner a small countertop television.  It's \"60 Minutes,\" the full show entitled \"Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D.\" and on the top right, \"PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN.\"  As Sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed... \n", "test1_input": "\"The Insider\", shooting draft, by Eric Roth & Michael Mann \nTHE  INSIDER \nwritten by \nERIC ROTH & MICHAEL MANN \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"OMITTED\" SLUGS.

Two men in front, shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once. But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN. \nEXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY \nThe Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house, and inside... \nINT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY \nA round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table... It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table... \nTHE SHEIKH Coffee? \nLOWELL Yeah...  Thank you. \nTHE SHEIKH How have you liked your stay? \nLOWELL (droll) What I've seen...I've liked. \nThe Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse is put down. \nTHE SHEIKH Please to explain, why I should agree to interview...with pro-Zionist American media? \nLOWELL Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America.  And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face. (confident) That's why. \nAnd we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come here voluntarily. \nTHE SHEIKH Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first.  Then I decide if I grant the interview. \nLOWELL (blunt) No.  We don't do that. (beat) You've seen \"60 Minutes\" and Mike Wallace.  So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity.  You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America. \nThe Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying him.  And Lowell \"closes\": \nLOWELL (cont'd) So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a plane or not? \nThe Sheikh thinks it over and then... \nTHE SHEIKH Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow. \nLOWELL That's good.  That works. (after a beat) Uh, you know, I want to ask you something...I know it sounds odd...but... \nIt's quiet...too quiet... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) Hello, Sheikh...? (no answer) Hello, Sheikh...? \nSilence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone. The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left there, standing by the door still in his blindfold... \nLOWELL (CONT'D) Norman. \nNORMAN What?  What? \nLOWELL Take your blindfold off. \nThe lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian- American. \nLOWELL (CONT'D) (sarcastic) Welcome to the world. \nNorman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet. \nNORMAN Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable gennies and we'll run cable... \nLowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone... \nMIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER) Hello? \nLOWELL (into phone) Mike, it's me.

OUT OF FOCUS LAB TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition, as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his late forties, watching them... \nINT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx, educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him... \nINT. LOBBY, BROWN & WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY \nBriefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel microphone after Jeffrey's passed. \nINT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY \nLight mottled through trees reflects off the car window... Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial replica... \nINT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY \nJeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching television in the den...BARBARA. \nWIGAND Hi, honey. \nBARBARA Hi, Daddy. \nWIGAND What's new? \nBARBARA Ms. Laufer gave me a star today. \nWIGAND Yeah?  What for? \nBARBARA For reading. \nHe pours himself a drink at a wet bar. \nWIGAND That's great...  Little early for cartoons, isn't it? \nBARBARA Okay. \nDutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs. \nBARBARA (cont'd) Deborah?  Debbie? \nHe looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine. There's something like a Hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.  She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech... \nLIANE Oh, I didn't know you were home...  It's early...  Isn't it? \nHe doesn't say anything... \nLIANE (CONT'D) Gotta take Debbie to ballet... \nAnd it all feels suburban, familiar.  Suddenly there's a shout... \nBARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Mommy! \nJeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into... \nINT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY \nAnd a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation.  DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe asthmatic attack... \nWIGAND Sweetheart, c'mon.  C'mon. \nBARBARA She was playing with my Pooh doll again... \nJeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece. \nThe compressor whirs.  Deborah breathes in the medication. Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as... \nWIGAND Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down. Breathe deep.  Breathe deep.  Slow down, honey.  Slow down.  Slow down. \nLiane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water.  We don't know why yet... \nDeborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention. \nWIGAND (cont'd) Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths. \nBARBARA She was playing with the Pooh doll. \nWIGAND Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's - what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs \"don't breathe any more of that dust in.\" (beat) ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches.  And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh?  Okay?  You're better already, aren't you? \nAnd the medication's taking effect and she's calmer. \n", "test1_id": 2688, "test2_input": "THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) (to the Lawyers) Jeff's a premiere golfer...  What are you, a two handicap? \nWIGAND (precise) Seven... \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR (to lawyer) And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us.  He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky how he can concentrate. \nWIGAND I'd rather play than talk about it. (beat) What did you want to see me about?

(beat) You know, I came up through sales.  One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep. (beat) I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence... \nAnd there's a warning behind it... \nWIGAND (contained) Is that a threat? \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny...any more than are one's family matters... \nWIGAND (quietly) You threatening my family, now, too? \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff. (a beat) About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion... \nWIGAND \"Research...\" (smile + scorn) You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil... \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR That's why we hire scientists... \nWIGAND (interrupts, direct) Okay. (a beat, honest) I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements.  I was paid well for my work.  The health and welfare benefits are good.  The severance package is fair.  I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't. \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon reflection...we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you. \nAnd there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room... \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR (CONT'D) So we've drafted a supplement to your agreement...it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is \"confidential.\"  Nobody will be able to say, \"Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I didn't know that was a secret...\" (beat) We're very serious about protecting our interests. (a beat) We'd like you to sign it. \nAnd he's acutely aware of the threat behind it... \nWIGAND (a beat) And if I don't? \nA LAWYER (speaking for Sandefur) If we \"arrive\" at the conclusion you're acting in bad faith?  We would terminate, right now, payouts under your severance package.  You and your family's medical benefits.  And initiate litigation against you, Mr. Wigand. \nWIGAND Dr. Wigand. \nA LAWYER (a beat) Dr. Wigand...after you've examined the document, you will see it is in your own best interest and you'll sign it. \nJeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his face the true nature of this man. \nWIGAND So, what you are saying is:  it isn't enough that you fired me.  For no good reason!  Now you question my integrity? On top of the humiliation of being fired? You threaten me?!  You threaten my family?! (beat) It never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement... (turning, to Sandefur) But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and Brown & Williamson, too...  Fuck me? (a beat) Well, fuck you!! \nAnd with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet... \nA LAWYER I'm not sure he got the message... \nTHOMAS SANDEFUR (with total confidence) Oh, I think he did. \nEXT. A PHONE BOOTH, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nWigand picks up the phone and dials. \nINT. THE NEW YORK RESTAURANT - DAY \nThey've finished lunch.  Wallace and Hewitt are turned to talk to Sam Cohn and an older writer as suddenly Lowell's cell phone rings. \nLOWELL (answering) Yeah... \nWIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) ...you fucked me! \nLOWELL Who is this? \nEXT.

A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nWe see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  A caged cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf balls.  And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one after another, after another...  His swing is powerful, angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  He pauses, spent. Settling down, he exhales.  Then, he looks down the way... And he slows...  He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and tie, watching him...  And the Man in the suit right then, with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night. The \"insect\" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT. And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him. Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car, purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses to his car, getting in... \nINT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT \nHe drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind the wheel.  He turns.  And he sees the Man in the suit has gotten in the car next to his.  They look at each other.  The Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf club, jumps out of his car... \nEXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT \nGolf club in hand at the driver side window... \nWIGAND (motioning with the club, threatening) Stay away from me!  You stay away from me! \nThe Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  It's still.  And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something real, something imaginary... \nEXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS' HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nA violent rain's falling.  And we see Jeffrey coming out of the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.  They start towards the car.  There's the sound of a car door shutting.  Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them... \nLIANE Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches -- \nShe slows, seeing someone.  Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell. He's surprised. \nLOWELL Mrs. Wigand, how do you do? \nWIGAND (to the girls, protectively) Jump in, quick, c'mon... \nLOWELL I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the phone, remember? \nThe Girls climb in the car.  Lowell crosses behind the Audi around the far side. \nLOWELL (CONT'D) C'mere.  I want to talk to you. \nWIGAND Good.  I want to talk to you. \nJeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around the far side of the car. \nWIGAND (CONT'D) (confronting him) What do... \nLOWELL (running over) I did not burn you.  I did not give you up to anyone! \nWIGAND (continuing) This is my house...  In front of my wife, my kids?!  What business do we have? \nLOWELL To straighten something out with you. Right here.  Right now. \nWIGAND So, you didn't mention my name?  You haven't talked to anybody about me? \nLOWELL Why am I gonna mention your name? \nWIGAND How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...? \nLOWELL How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson? \nWIGAND It happened after I talked to you.  I do not like coincidences! \nLOWELL And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist.  Think.  Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it? \nWIGAND (skeptical) You came all the way down here to tell me that? \nLOWELL No.  I did not.  Big Tobacco is a big story.  And you got something important to say.  I can tell. (a beat, personal) But, yes.  I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people. \nIt starts to rain harder.  They look at each other.  Jeffrey, without saying a word, gets in the Car.  He backs out. Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain. Liane goes back into the house.  And Lowell starts back across the street to his car.  There's a sound.  He turns. Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back and stopped in the street. \nWIGAND (after a beat) Ride with me while I take the girls to school... \nLowell hesitates, then gets into the car in the back seat. \nINT.

Union Carbide in Japan.  I was general manager and director of new products.  I speak Japanese.  I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer.  All health- related. (wry) What else?

Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the feeling they've been talking for hours... \nLOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Just give me an example... \nWIGAND For example.  James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson...when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA...  He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him.  He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America.  Instantly.  And then he developed the safety cap...  Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right?  But he's also a man of science.  He's not going to allow his company...to put on the shelf...a product that might hurt people. (sarcastic) Not like the Seven Dwarfs... \nLOWELL Seven dwarfs? \nWIGAND The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco...they got up in front of Congress that time...it was on television... \nLOWELL ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease... \nWIGAND It was on C-SPAN.  Yeah. \nLOWELL Okay, so, here you are...you go to work for tobacco. (after beat) You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values.  You go to tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with everything else. (beat) What are you doing?  Why are you working for \"tobacco\" in the first place? \nWIGAND (deadly honest) I can't talk about it.  The work I was supposed to do...might have had some positive effect.  I don't know...it could have been beneficial. (bitterness there) Mostly, I got paid a lot.  I took the money.  My wife was happy.  My kids had good medical.  Good schools.  Got a great house. (simply) I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...? \nHe looks at Lowell, as if needing validation... \nLOWELL Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it; you're making money...you're providing for your family?  What could be wrong with that? \nIt's quiet.  After some moments... \nWIGAND I've always thought of myself...as a man of science.  That's what's wrong with it. \nLOWELL Then...you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. \nJeffrey doesn't say anything. \nLOWELL (CONT'D) Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really do need to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.  On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple.  You do so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing. There's only one guy who can figure that out for you.  And that's you.  All by yourself. \nLowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded?  As Wigand contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then Wigand sees the time... \nWIGAND I've got to go pick up the girls.  They only had half a day... \nLowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock. \nINT. A KITCHEN AREA, CBS OFFICES, NEW YORK - DAY \nWe've entered mid-scene...  A monitor on a cart plays a 1/2- inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast.  Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... in front of a bas relief of the American eagle.  Each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not, etc.... \nLOWELL (OVER) He referred to this...the Seven Dwarfs... \nMIKE WALLACE (OVER) What \"Seven Dwarfs?\" \nLOWELL (OVER) The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this...  Said they should be afraid of him...  I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. (to Staff Lawyers) Now, you tell me.  What does this guy have to say that threatens these people? \nAnd, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area. \nBeyond them are the \"60 MINUTES\" offices, workstations, piles of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling, all tuned to CBS programming... \n", "test3_true": "LOWELL Hardly new news. \nMIKE WALLACE No shit. \nLOWELL What's this? \nMARK STERN (re:  video) What that is is tobacco's standard defense.  It's the \"we don't know\" litany:  \"Addiction?  We believe not. Disease?  We don't know.  We take a bunch of leaves, roll 'em together.  You smoke 'em.  After that?  You're on your own. We don't know.\" (beat) So...tells me nothing. (beat) Besides, you'll never get what he's got. \nLOWELL Why not? \nJOHN HARRIS Because of this guy's confidentiality agreement, he is never gonna be able to talk to you. \nLOWELL That's not good enough.  This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America.  He's a corporate officer.  You never get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is the ultimate insider.  He's got something to say; he wants to say it; I want it on \"60 Minutes.\" \nJOHN HARRIS Doesn't matter what he wants. \nMIKE WALLACE Am I missing something here? \nJOHN HARRIS What do you mean, Mike? \nMIKE WALLACE He's got a corporate secrecy agreement? Give me a break.  This is a public-health issue, like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or...some company dumping cyanide into the East River.  Issues like that?  He can talk, we can air it. They've got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement. (re:  his coffee) Pass the milk... \nJOHN HARRIS (does) They don't need the right.  They've got the money. \nMARK STERN The unlimited checkbook.  That's how Big Tobacco wins every time.  On everything. They spend you to death.  $600 million a year in outside legal.  Chadbourne-Parke. Ken Starr's firm, Kirkland and Ellis. Listen.  GM and Ford, they get nailed after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up.  Right? These clowns have never...I mean ever... \nJOHN HARRIS Not even once... \nMARK STERN ...not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product...have ever lost a personal-injury lawsuit.  On this case, they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach, anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian... Tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years.  I'm telling you, they bat a thousand.  Every time.  He knows that. That's why he's not gonna talk to you... \nLowell's been quiet, thinking about something else...  Now... \nLOWELL Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way... \nMIKE WALLACE What do you mean? \nLOWELL We got a guy...who wants to talk but he's constrained. (beat) What if he were \"compelled\"? \nMIKE WALLACE (eating) Oh, torture?  Great ratings. \nMARK STERN What do you mean compelled? \nLOWELL (seriously) I mean compelled by a Justice Department, state courts, be a witness.  That would cut through any confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it? \nMARK STERN Yeah... \nDEBBIE DELUCA What does that do? \nLOWELL What do you mean, what's it do? \nDEBBIE DELUCA What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement? \nLOWELL Because he has to reveal it in a court of law.  It's on record, it's out.  It's no secret anymore.  So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate?  It's out in the world... \nMARK STERN (nods) If you could engineer it into the court record, you might have something.  They would have a helluva time trying to restrain his speech then, wouldn't they? \nPause. \nJOHN HARRIS (still skeptical) Yeah, but what venue?  And where does he get - does he have killer attorneys? \nLOWELL I don't think he's got any attorneys. \nMARK STERN He's gonna need attorneys who aren't afraid of risking years of litigation. And millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs... \nLOWELL What do you say, Mike?  What do you think? \nMIKE WALLACE (pause) Even if he gets the defense team, will he go for it? \nINT. A HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA, LOUISVILLE - DAY \nMRS. WATSON ...you're awfully overqualified, Dr. Wigand. \nThe aftermath of a high school lunch.  Tables, covered with litter, as far as the eye can see.  And we see Jeffrey sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of coffee... \nWIGAND (after a beat, awkward) I'm trying to...start a new career...  I believe I could be a good teacher... \nShe's quiet.  She senses this applicant has a lot on his mind. \nMRS. WATSON Let me give it some thought... \nWIGAND (selling) ...and not a lot of companies in the health-care field hire ex-tobacco scientists. \n", "test3_id": 2690}

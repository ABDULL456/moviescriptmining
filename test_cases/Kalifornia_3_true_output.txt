Suddenly, o.s., a scream pierces the moment! 
Early and Adele turn toward the doorway to see Mrs. Musgrave screaming. The older woman's eyes staring past Adele to the floor nearby. Adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to find... Mr. Musgrave's body lying on the floor. A bloodied wound in the back of his head. All of Adele's enthusiasm drains from her face. 
EARLY (to Mrs. Musgrave) Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow now. 
Mrs. Musgrave collapses to the floor. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER 
Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano. Across from them, Early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through Carrie's collection of erotic photography. 
EARLY (to Brian) Have you seen this one? That don't leave much to the imagination now does it? 
He looks at another photograph. Confused, he turns it upside down, stares at it. 
INT. THE DEN - SAME TIME 
Mrs. Musgrave is laid out on the couch. Adele, deep in thought, watches over the older woman. Finally Adele reaches into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small potted cacti. She gently places hers among them. 
ON MRS. MUSGRAVE 
Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger to her lips -- Shhhh. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her. 
EARLY (smiles and shakes his head in disbelief) That's you ain't it? 
Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns to see why... when... 
CARRIE (O.S.) You're right Early... 
Early stops. Looks back to Carrie. Brian also turns to her curiously. 
CARRIE ...It is me. Do you like it? 
Early looks at the photo again. Adele and Mrs. Musgrave now cross safely to the kitchen. Carrie eyes meet Early's. He smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and licks it. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
Adele quietly opens the back door. 
ADELE Go on now... please. 
Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape. 
ADELE (in a whisper) ...Call me. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
Early finishes looking through the photographs. He closes the cover of the portfolio. 
EARLY Well they say there's room fur all kinds in California... and that's where we're gonna be this time tomorrow. California. (beat) Adele honey? 
INT. KITCHEN 
EARLY (O.S.) Adele? 
Early enters, and sees Adele standing at the back door. Adele turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling the pistol from his waistband. 
AT THE KITCHEN DOOR 
Early pushes Adele out of the way. 
EARLY (shouting) Peaches! Come on back here. There ain't nothin' for you to be afraid of. 
EARLY POV - EXT. CACTUS GARDEN 
Aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the cacti, it's very dark. There's no sign of Mrs. Musgrave. 
INT. KITCHEN 
He steps outside and starts firing his gun into the blackness... bullets THUNK into the cacti. 
EARLY (shouting over the gunfire) Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! 
ADELE Early! Stop!! 
Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the kitchen door, bewildered. Then... 
EARLY (O.S.) Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!! 
Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the cactus ripped the flesh. 
EARLY (perplexed) Honey... What do you think you're doin'? 
Adele starts to cry. 
EARLY Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit. 
ADELE I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people. 
A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before. That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.

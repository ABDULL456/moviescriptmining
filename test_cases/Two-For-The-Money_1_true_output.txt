What if I don't pay? 
BRANDON It's simple, you don't get any more picks.  Comprende?  So make the bet, make the drink and let's roll this into 
something big! 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
BRANDON jamming, using a phone headset. 
BRANDON To hell with power ratings -- McNab lost his dog yesterday! Hunting accident.  Everyone knows you don't mess with a man who just lost his dog!  Take Atlanta plus the points and send me ten thou Western Union by tomorrow, Stan -- let's ride this wave into Sunday! 
(punching a new call) 
Denny!  Sorry to keep you on hold, bro...  Hell yeah it takes pictures, bitchen 
little phone, huh?  Now I got something else for ya, Green Bay against Minnesota, take the Cheesheads... That's right -- go to a sports book and put 500 hundred on 'em... So I'll send you the money to bet... Don't worry about it, just JPEG your big brother a smile when you win. 
INT. SALES ROOM - DAY 
WALTER paces like a hyped-up Ahab as his SALESMEN jam. 
SOUTHIE Billy, thanks for the 15,000 Fed Ex. What're you up, 160 or something? 
Did you ever go 12-2 betting college football before?  Didn't think so.  Now, Greenbay--Dallas--Cleveland--100,000 across the board, got it? 
REGGIE The fuck do you care how he does it?  And where the hell's our 30 grand for hitting that 3-team college parlay last night? 
HERBIE (sipping a cup of tea) 
Do this, call your off-shore sports book right now and put the whole 100,000 on Green Bay-Dallas-Cleveland, it's called a three-team parlay and pays 6-1.  I do appreciate the 40,000 you sent us today, but let me assure you we've only just begun to make serious money. 
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY 
NFL GAMES fill the TV screens.  Theme music, announcers and action create a frenetic pace. 
TIME LAPSE SAME SHOT.  LATER.  Sunday sports start winding down and -- 
TIME LAPSE SAME SHOT.  LATER.  All the screens are dark save one, where the last game of the day finally ends in overtime and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
BRANDON pulls the headset, heads out to the water fountain. SALESMEN work the phones, glance at him as he passes. 
Herbie 
... Hey -- great job. 
INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
TONI in the kitchen cooking pasta.  Moving fast.  BRANDON sits in the living room, watches JULIA ride WALTER like a horse. Music on the stereo. 
JULIA Faster daddy! 
WALTER crawls around the room, stops before BRANDON, grins. 
WALTER 10-2 in pro football?  85 percent for the weekend?  Jesus, you're a mutant. 
JULIA Go daddy! 
WALTER whinnies like a horse, keeps crawling.  BRANDON goes into the kitchen.  TONI cooking at the stove, referring to a daily planner, talking on the phone. 
TONI Monday's no good because I take Julia to ballet.  Tuesday I work late at the salon.  Wednesday's a maybe if I can move a couple clients to after six but I'll have to check.  I really want to come in with him.  Listen, I have to call you back tomorrow. 
(grabbing a pot about to boil over) 
BRANDON What's all the commotion? 
TONI The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program.  I want to be there the first time he goes.  Make sure the trainer understands Walter's aversion to consistency. 
BRANDON Aversion to consistency? 
TONI He's always been that way. 
BRANDON Well that's consistent. 
CLOSE ON -- WALTER watches from the living room -- sees TONI and BRANDON laughing, enjoying each other and -- 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
WALTER, TONI and BRANDON relaxing after dinner. 
WALTER Life is fucking... good. 
(burp, regarding BRANDON) 
Let's talk about making it better. 
TONI Duck, Brandon, here it comes. 
WALTER I've been tracking you since last year. 
TONI Don't let him steamroll you.

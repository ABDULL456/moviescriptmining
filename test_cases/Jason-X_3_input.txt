RIZZO tNighty-night. 
Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman stands, blocks his path. 
CRUTCH Leave her be. 
RIZZO Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat? 
Thorgan timidly raises his hand. 
RIZZO Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me. 
THORGAN Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. 
Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall. 
RIZZO How do you open the damn door? 
YLLO You're crazy! 
Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open. 
DELONGPRE Rizzo, he's out there. 
RIZZO Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. (looks at Delongpre) Last chance. 
The others stare at her. She's crazy. 
RIZZO Fine. Bye. 
She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them. 
YLLO (favoring his nose) Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour. The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it. 
But the kids aren't so sure. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console. 
YLLO Computer on line. 
A series of beeps. 
JANESSA(O.S.) What are you doing? 
YLLO (jumps) Jesus! Can't you knock? (back to console) Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf. 
COMPUTER VOICE Power to Beowulf disengaged. 
YLLO (to Janessa) She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE 
Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections. 
FAT LOU Disengage auto-pilot. 
BERNIE Disengaged. 
FAT LOU New COURSE, seven-eighty-one. 
EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV 
She banks slowly to the right. 
INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE 
BERNIE On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds. 
FAT LOU Engage auto pilot. 
Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through the console as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish. 
BERNIE En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta... 
Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop of her. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has legs. Little good they'll do him. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD. 
Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB. A monitor reads ... 
SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CARGO BAY 
Rizzon and Kkinsa enter. 
RIZZO Which way? 
Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops. 
KKINSA What? 
RIZZO Ssh. 
Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates. 
RIZZO He's in here. 
Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's mouth. 
RIZZO You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it? 
Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her. 
KKINSA (whispers) How do you know?

MELANIE Why? 
MITCH I think it could be fun. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
pulling the door shut. 
MELANIE That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
MITCH It is for me. 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
MELANIE But not for me. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
MITCH What do you want ? 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
MELANIE (angrily sarcastic) I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night! 
MED. SHOT - THE CAR 
as it pulls away. Mitch yanks his hands back from the door. 
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH 
as he watches the car leave. 
LONG SHOT - THE ROAD 
The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the long line of telephone poles and wires and... something strange on the wires. 
CLOSE SHOT MITCH 
His attention caught by the poles and wires. 
CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES 
Hundreds of birds sitting on them. 
MED. SHOT - MITCH 
standing and watching. A wind blows off the water. He shivers suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE 
HAYWORTH 
In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front DOOR OPENING. 
ANNIE Miss Daniels? Is that you? 
MELANIE (O.S.) Yes. 
Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT: 
ANNIE Hi. (seeing her face) Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you? 
MELANIE (touching her head) No, it's not the cut that's bothering me. 
ANNIE (concerned) Would you like some brandy? 
MELANIE If you have some, I'd... 
ANNIE I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt? 
As Annie gets the brandy: 
MELANIE No, thank you. (pause) Won't you call me Melanie? 
ANNIE All right. (she smiles) 
MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully. 
MELANIE Thank you. 
ANNIE (sitting opposite her) It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay. 
Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause. 
ANNIE Well, how'd your evening go? 
Melanie shrugs. 
ANNIE Did you meet Lydia? 
Melanie nods. 
ANNIE Or would you rather I changed the subject? 
MELANIE (with a tired smile) I think so. 
ANNIE (nodding) How do you like our little hamlet? 
MELANIE I despise it. 
ANNIE (laughing) Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to. 
MELANIE Where are you from originally, Annie? 
ANNIE San Francisco. 
MELANIE How'd you happen to come here? 
ANNIE Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago. 
There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs. 
ANNIE Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner. 
Melanie nods. 
ANNIE I guess you knew that, anyway. 
MELANIE I suspected as much. 
ANNIE You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago. 
MELANIE Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me. 
ANNIE Isn't there? (she shrugs) Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl. 
MELANIE What do you mean?

DEBORAH 
(to catering women) We can do it. Come on. She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down, one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet, even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(great exertion) Why... do... I... care.. so.. much.. about.... CRAP? And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty, spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half- heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off. She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Can you believe they left without finishing? As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame. 
DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D) 
Looks great, huh?.... You're not looking. 
JOHN 
I was getting a kick looking at you look at it. Not the answer she wanted.. 
DEBORAH 
I better get dressed again in case anybody's just a half hour late. She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she looks at it all she has a wistful moment. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(a replenishing sigh) Okay..We're okay here. (then) Why can't everything be like sod? There's no wait, no dung, nothing you have to do right and yet it's perfect. It covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty..then, the miracle, if you just give it time, it roots and you can't tell it from the real thing. (a look to her husband) No reaction. Nothing to say. 
JOHN 
Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I don't have anything particular to say. 
DEBORAH 
Oh, John why don't you just take out a knife and kill me all together. Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit. 
JOHN 
How'd you get there..Hey, wait a minute..Deb..stop..come on. (she turns) I'd like to figure this one out. What would have been the great thing for me to say after you said the sod sentence?..Really. 
DEBORAH 
That's actually a good question. 
JOHN 
There you go. I surprise sometimes. 
DEBORAH 
I would have liked, if after I compared the sod to life, if you had said, "Exactly!" She turns to leave. 
JOHN 
Yeah. But to say that and mean it I'd have to think the same way you do. 
DEBORAH 
(some sense of mischief) It's worth a try...I had something else to tell you...it'll come to me.. 
36   INT. OLIVE GARDEN TYPE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                 36 
Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant, Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing beside her, bounces with energy and joy. 
CRISTINA 
Could we have a table for two, please? Flor says something to her in Spanish..the daughter waves it off and when the mother persists, she translates. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
We're celebrating. 
HOSTESS 
Smoking or non-smoking? Before her daughter can translate. 
FLOR 
Dancing! The hostess laughs..They are seated at the two ends of a banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting and "scootches" closely together. Cristina picks up a menu and points to the prices. 
CRISTINA 
Wow, expensive.. 
Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a week..then looks at the prices and does a take. The hostess returns --- Cristina points to the menu. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
This is just for the starter? Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places her hand over the prices in the menu. 
HOSTESS 
Uh-huh..And those men would like to buy you a drink. The daughter translates...the hostess points out the early 30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen. Flor addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to translate. 
CRISTINA 
(to men) This is very embarrassing but-- "what's wrong with you? I'm with my daughter for God's sake!" Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh. Cristina relishes getting back to ordering from the menu...in a moment that is a bit noteworthy.. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
And I would like to begin with the Jumbo Shrimp. 
37   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY - 6:30 A.M.                          37 
Flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of domestics. Deborah jogs into view. 
DEBORAH 
Hi, Flor..See you up there. Deborah runs past..She is clearly upset..She is also more than a stay-in-shape jogger. She is an athletic woman fueled by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. This makes her seriously quick. She is highly aware of passing everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left, please," "left," "left." 
38   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY                           38 
John enters his son's room..GEORGIE, age 9. 
JOHN 
Okay...think SERIOUSLY about getting up. You don't have to get up yet but are you thinking seriously about it? 
GEORGIE 
Yes. 
JOHN 
Okay.

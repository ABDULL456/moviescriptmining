STU You think she's what those Guamian dudes wanted? 
VICK No. I think she's Alan's wife. Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet- sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods. 
VICK (CONT'D) Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy? A second later Alan enters, what's up? 
VICK (CONT'D) Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan. Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor, her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God. 
ALAN What...what am I supposed to do? 
STU Wake her up, man! 
ALAN Why me?! 
VICK Because she's your spouse, dude! Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared, he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder. 
VICK (CONT'D) Pinch her tit. It always works. Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up, terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented. 
CHASTITY Dang, did I sleep in the closet again...? Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles, recognizing them: 
CHASTITY (CONT'D) Oh hey, guys! What's up? She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face. The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife. 
CHASTITY (CONT'D) Morning, honey... She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie. Beat. Alan is speechless. 
STU She seems really cool. 
VICK Yeah, I really like her, man. 
INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM 
Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string -- from around the totalled living room. The guys file in. 
VICK So, um, did you take Alan's name? 
STU Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish now--? 
ALAN Listen to me. Just...did we, or did we not, have sex last night? Alan braces, please say no, please say no... Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes... 
CHASTITY Well...ya? Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES! 
CHASTITY (CONT'D) But we waited til we were married. Alan GROANS. 
VICK What a responsible, upstanding young Jew. They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right? Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels. 
CHASTITY I know -- he even wanted to use a rubber. Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT. 
ALAN Wait-- we didn't use a condom?! 
CHASTITY It's cool, I sponge. Alan leans against a wall, dizzy. 
ALAN Can someone...please open a window? 
Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck. 
STU They don't open. 
CHASTITY So you guys don't remember any of last night? 
VICK Yeah, not so much. 
CHASTITY Hey, been there before, right? (grabbing her sizable bra) Sucks, though. The wedding was really fun. I'm bummed you don't remember it, Alan. She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan: 
STU Dude, I think your wife's mad at you. 
VICK You don't happen to remember what time we met you last night, do you?

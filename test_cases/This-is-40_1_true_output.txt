Pete enters from the hallway. He sees Larry and turns around before anyone notices him. 
LARRY She's a little pip. Just like her mommy. So I might have a job tomorrow, at least I'm going to go try to give an estimate. Do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours? 
DEBBIE (conflicted) Okay. 
LARRY This is nice. You and I don't spend enough time together, do we? 
DEBBIE We spend enough time together. 
LARRY We do? 
DEBBIE It's quality time. 
LARRY Then we do. I'll go with what you think. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie are in bed. Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie. 
DEBBIE What else did they say? 
PETE Some kid named Joseph-- 
DEBBIE I know Joseph. 
PETE You do? He's making a "Hot or Not" list. 
DEBBIE What? 
PETE So, Sadie said, "That's so   lame and immature that you're doing   that." And then Joseph says, "Yo,   girl. We're just having some fun   so don't be a bitch, yo." 
DEBBIE That is not nice. 
PETE So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me a bitch." And Joseph said, "I didn't call you a bitch, I said don't act like a bitch. And by the way you're in the `Not Hot' column." 
DEBBIE Who made him the judge of hot? 
PETE Do you realize what that could do to her self-esteem? 
DEBBIE What a little fuckhead. I'll kill him. 
PETE So then Sadie said, "You're in the jackass column. I've got to go. I'm bored of you." 
DEBBIE That is cool. That's taking the high road. 
PETE For some reason, there's an emoticon of a panda doing push-ups. 
DEBBIE I wonder what that means. 
PETE I don't think it means anything, I think it's just adorable. 
DEBBIE Aww. She's a good girl. She was polite, and she stood up for herself. 
PETE That's pretty cool. 
They hear a door slam. Debbie gasps. 
PETE (CONT'D) What? 
DEBBIE Shit. I thought she was coming in. 
PETE Oh my god, that scared me to death. 
DEBBIE If she caught us, she would kill us. 
Debbie starts looking through the iPad. Pete's iPhone chimes. He sees a message from Ronnie from work. It reads: "Got the numbers. Call me." 
Pete looks ashen. He looks over at Debbie who is oblivious. 
PETE I've got to make a call. 
INT. HOME OFFICE - NIGHT 
Pete paces. 
PETE (whispering loudly) We sold how many? 
RONNIE (O.C.) Six hundred and twelve album downloads. 
PETE Wait a minute. There are no zeros after that? 
RONNIE (O.C.) There are zeros, but all of them are before six hundred and twelve. There are none after. 
PETE How is that even possible? 
RONNIE (O.C.) Out of three hundred million Americans, six hundred and twelve people chose to download the album. You could personally call everyone who bought this record. 
PETE We're fucked! Here's the deal. I want you to meet me tomorrow morning at eight o'clock. I want a list of at least thirty ideas of what we can do to change this. (MORE) 
PETE (CONT'D) We have to change this. I started a record label because I couldn't get a job, so I have no other options. 
INT. CAR - MORNING 
Pete is driving. Sadie and Charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily. Pete is very upset about the record not selling. 
INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Debbie is talking to their ACCOUNTANT. 
DEBBIE What financial problems? 
ACCOUNTANT Well, for one thing, you were right, you are missing about ten thousand dollars from the store. And then, Pete's record not selling well. 
DEBBIE I thought we weren't supposed to hear for three weeks?

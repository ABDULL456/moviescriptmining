{"train": "POINT BREAK \nby \nJames Cameron \nKathryn Bigelow \nFrom the Screenplay by \nW. Peter Iliff \nFADE IN: \nWe are in the belly of a wave. Light refracts in a constant collision of water. SLOW MOTION, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid diamonds taking flight, dreamlike... \nEXT.  OCEAN - DUSK \nBacklit against a flaming sun a solitary SURFER glides across the green glassy peak.  TIME IS STRETCHED until his movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world. Total Zen concentration.  Body weight centered, eyes forward and on the next section. \nEXT.  URBAN STREET - DUSK \nSLOW MOTION ON a black sedan. Creeping along store fronts.  Past a Winchell's. PEOPLE splash steps down rain-washed sidewalks in DREAM MOTION.  The sedan turns past the FIRST VIRGINIA BANK and into an alley. \nINT.  BLACK SEDAN \nTWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats and hats.  Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch taut from the base of their nose to their forehead, hideously distorting their features.  Makes them look like human PIGS. \nEXT.  OCEAN \nSILVERY in this light, almost metallic, as if from some future-scape.  The lone surfer SHREDS a long, endless right wall. ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit, digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers down. His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied-- \nINT.  BLACK SEDAN \nAn M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a CACHACK!  Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI. Watches are checked.  The PIG NOSE people nod to each other. \nEXT.  BANK \nPig Nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors, slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast. \nEXT.  OCEAN \nFAST NOW -- the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face of the wave.  The surfer TRIMS down the line, pivoting the board and going straight down, CARVING the bottom.  He slashes viciously back toward the lip and-- \nIn a radical INVERTED AIR ATTACK sails SIX feet above the wave in an explosion of water-- \nINT.  BANK \n--BAAAAAAMMM! Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.  He fires a burst into the ceiling.  BRRAAMM!! \nPIG NOSE #1 EVERYBODY on the floor! \nPEOPLE drop. VERY FAST HERE-- Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers-- Another PIG NOSE watches the door-- Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in hand. \nINT.  SURVEILLANCE VAN \nDark. Monitors SHOW SLOW SCANS of the bank INTERIOR. Two MEN wear headphones and black windbreakers with FBI stenciled on the back.  One watches with binoculars. \nBINOCULARS Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go. Where's the big college quarterback?!  Are you with us, Utah? \nEXT.  BANK WALL \nA MAN in his twenties.  His head spins revealing rain- slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright.  An edgy handsomeness to him. He pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun on one leg and leans against the wall.  He wears a headset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for him. This is JOHNNY UTAH. \nBINOCULARS (FILTERED) Utah, where the hell are ya!? \nUtah takes his headset off... \nINT.  BANK \nPig Nose #1 LEAPS over the counter, holds a canvas sack filled with booty from tellers' drawers. \nPIG NOSE #1 Fuckin' shake it! \nLooking down the face of the concrete monolith at Wilshire and Veteran.  Ant-like, Johnny Utah's tiny figure moves toward the entrance. \nVOICE (OVER) Day One in LA, special agent Utah. You may have been top two percent of your class at Quantico but you have exactly zero hours in the field here.  You know nothing... \nINT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI BULLPEN \nSupervising Agent BEN HARP leads Utah across the bullpen. Rows of desks.  Agents sitting at computer terminals. Data hell.  Looks like he got a job at Xerox. \nHARP You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. \nUTAH Yes, sir. \nUtah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase.  Harp is mid-thirties, confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect of hair.  GQ.  Aggressive. \nHARP Eating solid breakfasts, Utah? \nUTAH Sir? \nHARP All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes... \nUTAH (poker face) I take the skin off chicken. \nHarp glances at him, eyes narrowing.  They reach a glassed-in compound of small offices.  Harp swings the door open and the other agents look up as Utah enters. \nHARP This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- \nUTAH 1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before. \nHARP That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent? \nUTAH Zero distortion, sir. \nHe picks up a donut from someone's desk, a succulent glazed jelly. \nUTAH I love these things. \nHe looks right at Harp.  Takes a big fuck-you bite. \nHARP You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage. \nUTAH Not so far. \nCUT TO: \nUNDERWATER \nA blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines. VOOM!  A figure rockets down INTO FRAME in a curtain of bubbles.  A gawky AGENT, in less than stylish FBI trunks, flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom of a pool. \nINT.  GYMNASIUM POOL - DAY \nThe pool casts wavy distortions upon TWO DOZEN MEN, all grumbling as they stand in line, wearing T-shirts with FBI logos, sweats and sneakers.  We hear a splash, and the men shuffle forward. \nPAPPAS (V.O.) The dolls love this baby.  It brings them luck when they rub it -- right between their buttons. \nCLOSE ON tape measure wrapped around a generous belly. PULL BACK to reveal VETERAN AGENT COREY measuring the ample waist of ANGELO PAPPAS.  This 54 year old silver haired Greek stands rubbing his belly like a Zulu chief. \nCOREY Angelo, we need a bigger tape. \nPAPPAS Just read the goddamn number. \nCOREY Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it down, wear a girdle-- \nPAPPAS Screw you and this holistic fitness crap!  At least my arms don't flap in the wind. \nCorey secretly squeezes his bicep as... A whistle blows.  A broad shouldered MAN wearing an FBI cap barks at the Greek. \nBIG SHOULDERS Okay, Pappas, let's put on the blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom. \nJOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in the distance.  Says something to one of the agents.  Is pointed toward us as-- Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of the pool. \nPAPPAS I've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and I got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a Special Agent! \nJohnny has walked up.  Pappas, blindfolded, turns directly to Utah as he continues, thinking it's Corey. \nUTAH & PAPPAS are watching a monitor in the glassed-in office.  The robbery REPLAYS on grainy BLACK & WHITE videotape. The bandits barge in, raise shotguns and order everybody to the floor. \nUTAH Good move. \nPAPPAS Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers. \nVIDEO TAPE -- Utah is reverse-scanning.  The bandits walk BACKWARD into the bank.  The explosion of blue ink is sucked back into the pack of money, then leaps back into President Nixon's hand. \nUTAH They don't go for the vault? \nPAPPAS Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy. \nUTAH Smart.  You burn time in the vault. \nPAPPAS Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish. \nUtah stops the video, now FAST-FORWARDING it, stopping where President Nixon separates the exploding \"dye pack\" planted with the money, before he tosses it aside. \nUTAH Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs. \nPAPPAS The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid. \nOutside the windowed partition POLICE OFFICERS interview frightened customers. Hotshot agents MUNOZ and COLE enter from the main floor of the bank.  Think they're very slick. \nMUNOZ Anytime you two are finished jerking off watching MTV I need to get a look at that tape. \nCOLE (sloppy grin) Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your theory on the Presidents? \nPAPPAS Just take the tape, Cole. \nNow Munoz starts to smile. \nMUNOZ Hang ten, Pappas, like totally rad... (to Utah) I gotta tell ya, the department loves it. \nUTAH What's he talking about, Angelo? \nHarp raps glass.  Cole and Munoz look sharp. Harp enters addressing Pappas and Utah. \nHARP They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it. \nPAPPAS What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here? \nHARP Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while. \nCole and Munoz gloat. \nPAPPAS Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years. \nHARP (zeroing in on Pappas) That's the point, isn't it? \nPAPPAS Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp? \nHARP Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay? \nThe Greek rises like a proud bull. \nPAPPAS Sure.  No problem.  How about your office?  Your office need vacuuming? We could do that too. \nPappas and Utah move toward the door.  It's a tight squeeze as they pass Cole and Munoz.  Especially Pappas. \nPAPPAS Excuse me. \nRead as fuck you. \nEXT.  MULHOLLAND SCENIC TURNOUT - NIGHT \nThe diamond field of LA glitters below.  The small parking area off Mulholland is filled with squad cars.  Red and blue disco. A flock of UNIFORMS milling about a non-descript CHEVY. \nINT.  SEDAN FRONT SEAT \nFLASHLIGHT BEAM prowls the interior, stopping on a small printed card, folded like a pup tent, left upon the bench seat.  It reads \"Sanitized For Your Protection.\" \nPAPPAS Cute huh?  They love to fuck with us. \nUTAH ... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before. \nPAPPAS Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer. \nUtah stares at Angelo as it dawns.  Grins suddenly. \nUTAH They're traveling the rest of the year on the money, going where the waves are... \nPappas starts to smile.  Suddenly, he jumps up onto his desk, gets down in a speed-crouch, arms extended. \nPAPPAS (to one and all) The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to finance their endless summer! \nJohnny watches, grinning.  The night security GUARD walks in.  Utah turns to the guard, shrugs. \nUTAH I think he needs a vacation. \nThe guard nods understanding. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SURFSHOP - MALIBU PIER - DAY \nLong stack-up rack of gleaming SURFBOARDS. A HAND reaches in, pulling out a board from the middle of the deck. \nJOHNNY UTAH hefts it.  Sights along it.  Trying to look familiar with alien equipment.  Behind him is a whip-thin 15 YEAR OLD SALESMAN.  Nut-brown with platinum hair, jammed day-glo shorts, sleeveless T-shirt, unlaced Ug- boots. \nHighest performance, very kind.  If you want to get aggro, man, this stick can handle your best rage. Where you surf? \nUTAH I don't. \nWhoa!!  Back up!  This's a 5'6\" tri- fin squash-tail thruster.  You'd eat major shit on this, dude. \nACROSS THE ROOM we see Pappas trying on purple wraparound sunglasses. \nThe salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish firebird paint scheme.  Like a lowrider flame-job.  The logo reads \"Dance with the Universe.\" \nHere, you need a rhino chaser like this one to learn on.  Good board. I mean for a pig board. \nUtah hefts the board.  Scowls.  Hates anything he's not great at. \nPAPPAS sets his purchases on a counter: the glasses, some plutonium-pink shorts, T-shirts, sun-block.  The GIRL behind the counter is sixteen, barely contained in a macrame bikini-top and \"Dolphin\" shorts.  Angelo picks up a package of Sex Wax from a rack.  Sniffs it. \nPAPPAS (reading the label) \"Best for your stick\", huh?  This might not be enough.  I better get two. \nThe girl stifles a grin.  Thinks he's cute.  At the other end of the counter, 15 is ringing up Utah's board. \nHey, man, guys your age learning to surf, it's cool, there's nothing wrong with it. \nUTAH I'm twenty-five. \nSee that's what I'm saying, it's never too late. \nUtah picks up the board and moves to leave. \nHope you stay with it.  Surfin's the source.  It'll change your life. Swear to God. \nEXT.  MALIBU PIER - DAY \nUtah and Pappas walking back to the car. Two FBI agents in suits and ties walking with a day-glo orange surfboard.  Surreal image.  The ocean shimmers in B.G. \nPAPPAS Johnny, it's the only way. \nUTAH Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions. \nAngelo stops at the railing, points toward the ocean. \nPAPPAS Look.  Look at them out there. \nLONG LENS on packs of surfers sitting outside.  Bobbing slowly.  Hunched like sea birds.  Waiting for an unseen sign.  Disappearing and reappearing beyond the break. \nPAPPAS They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech. \nUTAH Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet. \nIN THE WASHING MACHINE, Utah tumbles in a cold green hell. His chest is convulsing, needing air now. Suddenly a FIGURE lunges down INTO FRAME. A hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him toward-- \nTHE SURFACE.  The WOMAN SURFER bursts through the foam. Grabs her board for leverage.  Hauls Utah's head above the water with one strong arm. He is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against the surf, panic registering in his movements. \nWOMAN SURFER (yelling above the roar) Swim, goddammit!  Come on!  Move it! \nThe woman gets her board under one of his arms for support and sidekicks fiercely into the wave, holding him in a painful grip. With powerful strokes, she helps Utah make it to calmer water outside the break.  The big waves, just forming up, lift them and drop them as they pass.  Muted thunder when the waves hit the beach.  She drags him half onto her surfboard. Practically slamming his face into the board. He's coughing out saltwater. \nON THE WOMAN, our first good look at her. She is EXQUISITE.  Hair slicked tight to her high- cheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that burn bright. Especially when she's pissed. \nWOMAN Look crazy son of a bitch!  You wanna commit suicide, you do it someplace else! \nShe undoes her leash and swims rapidly off, returning in a few seconds with Johnny's board.  He takes it from her and flops over it, still coughing. Wipes at the salt-snot running out of his nose. There is a cut over his eye from when he re-arranged the rocks on the bottom. \nWOMAN Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit. It's still got the price tag on it, for Chrissakes.  What'd you do, buy it yesterday?  You've got no business out here whatsoever. \nStill gagging and gasping, Johnny manages a goofy grin. \nUTAH Well, I saw you and-- \nWOMAN Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork! \nShe yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away from him. \nUTAH Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in? \nWOMAN (without turning) Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully. \nUTAH (yelling now) My name's Johnny Utah! \nWOMAN Who cares! \nUTAH I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him. \nJohnny calmly starts paddling toward shore. Thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him. He's stoic in the face of certain death. \nUTAH (over his shoulder, gamely) Bye. \nWOMAN Wait!  Jesus Christ! (swimming back to him) You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me. \nThe woman paddles parallel to the shore and Utah pumps along behind her.  She gets him away from the rocks, then starts watching the incoming swell, timing it to the lull between sets... \nWOMAN Go when I say.  But stay down.  Just lie on the board.  Alright, let's go! \nUtah paddles rapidly, following her, watching what she does. He is borne up by a low glassy wall. He bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak. Tumbles.  Stands unsteadily, grabbing his board.  Runs clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes, sucking water out. On terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick-out gracefully and disappear beyond the wave. \nHe flops on the sand.  Shivering.  Miserable. \nEXT.  COAST HIGHWAY - LATER \nLONG LENS... the woman is peeling off her wetsuit next to a BATHTUB PORSCHE that needs a paint job.  Her board is propped in the passenger seat.  Stereo is pumping. \nUTAH WATCHES THROUGH BINOCULARS from 50 yards up the road. \nTHE WOMAN, in a bikini, towels off briskly. Swimmer's shoulders.  Long muscular legs.  Lean and mean. She jumps into the car without bothering to open the door. Looks at her watch -- her manner is late, in a hurry. Through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something else, not too concerned about the morning traffic right next to her. She pulls on a T-shirt and them performs a Houdini act to extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole. \nUTAH WATCHES IMPASSIVELY.  He starts his car and pulls out onto PCH to follow as the bathtub Porsche zooms past. \nEXT.  NEPTUNE'S NET \nUtah cruises up slowly, pulls off the road. Up ahead the Porsche turns into the parking lot of NEPTUNE'S NET, a Coast Highway hangout that serves high- grade steamed sea-critters and beer to low-grade road trash, bikers and surfers. \nLean-and-Mean, wearing jeans and T-shirt, jumps out of the Porsche.  She hurries to the door of the Net, unlocking it for a couple of Mexican cooks -- helpers wearing expressions like they wait like this for her every day. \nUTAH puts down his binoculars and jots the Porsche's license number down on a Tastee-Freeze bag.  867CDH. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  COMPUTER ROOM - DAY \nGreen glow washes the intent faces of Utah and Pappas as MISS DEER data specialist, enters 867 CDH into her computer. She is purebred American Indian, strong featured and beautiful. The screen freezes and the hard disk churns. The DMV rap sheet scrolls down the screen. \nPAPPAS This is your surfer contact? Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes. 5'6\".  119 lbs? \nHarp inhales through his nose.  A bad sign. \nHARP Where is Pappas? \nUtah points across the room.  Harp turns. PAPPAS, sitting behind his desk in his \"Surf This\" T-shirt and pink shorts, lifts the purple Vuarnets like Tom Cruise in Risky Business. Looks directly at Harp.  Smiles innocently. \nINT.  HARP'S OFFICE \nHarp paces.  Type-A suppressed rage. Utah and Pappas endure Harp's wrath. \nHARP Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me? \nUTAH Caught my first tube this morning. \nPappas signals, unseen by Harp, for Utah to shut the fuck up. \nINT.  CORRIDOR TO COMPUTER ROOM \nJohnny and Angelo walking. \nPAPPAS What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car? \nUTAH It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this. \nPAPPAS Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon. \nJohnny cocks an eyebrow and opens the door to the computer room ceremonially, like a doorman at the Ritz-Carlton. Miss Deer looks up as they enter. \nINT.  COMPUTER ROOM \nTIGHT ON CRT as a lab report scrolls up the screen.  Gas chromatography and spectroanalysis.  Columns of elements and compounds, listed as percentage-of-sample. \nMISS DEER (V.O.) Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed LBJ's ponytail.  We recovered one hair. \nWIDER, showing Utah and Pappas over her shoulder at the terminal. \nPAPPAS Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year. Guy got his jaw broken for it. \nMISS DEER One four centimeter strand.  Color brown.  Oily.  Slight wave. \nPAPPAS Hell, what're we waiting for, let's go pick the guy up. \nUTAH Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic. \nPAPPAS Guy's the Toxic Avenger. \nUtah is excited as he fits the pieces together for his partner. \nUTAH The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this? \nPAPPAS No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LATIGO - DAY \nDepartment of Health sign reads, \"Beach Temporarily Closed.\" Beyond it crashes a wasted northwest swell. \nTwo frustrated teenage SURFERS huddle underneath a towel. Marijuana smoke seeps upward. A sandaled FOOT enters frame and taps their leg.  Angry heads poke up from beneath the towel, nostrils and mouths billowing smoke. The two wear T-shirts which read \"Passion for Slashin\" and \"Psycho Stick\". PAPPAS smiles, standing there in his beach wear, trying to blend in.  He doesn't. \nPAPPAS When you two are done makin' out, I need to talk to you. \n\"PSYCHO-STICK\" T-SHIRT Hey, I ain't no butt-bouncer, dude. We're from the valley.  Mall babes 'n shit. \nThe kids proudly high-five. \nPAPPAS I just want to know if you surf here a lot. \n\"PASSION FOR SLASHIN'\" T-SHIRT Shit yeah, like totally everyday when it's jammin'.  What is this, fucking narco entrapment or what, dude? \nPappas flashes his FBI star.  He whips out a pair of scissors. Brandishes them like some over-the-hill \"Jason\". \nPAPPAS Not exactly, dudes. \nTONE Waste of time. \nWARCHILD We're just going to fuck you up. \nUTAH Oh. \nAs they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a whistling roundhouse.  Its edge slams Warchild in the gut and folds him double.  The bad news is... Warchild gets an arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down. The board splits into two pieces. Utah drops his end as the others close.  A flurry of punches and kicks, most of which he blocks.  But he's lost the offensive. Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style side-kick. \nTIGHT ON Utah's towel, talking with Pappas' voice. \nPAPPAS Johnny?  You there? \nANGELO gets out of the car fast.  He jogs twenty feet and raises the binoculars.  Catches a glimpse of the carnage around the edge of the building.  Breaks into a run, massive legs pistoning. \nJOHNNY HITS THE GROUND hard.  He rolls and comes up fast. The razorhead brothers are a little surprised. \nARCHBOLD The dude can fight! \nWarchild grabs Utah from behind.  Gets him in a headlock. Archbold and Tone pin his arms.  Bunker starts working him like a practice bag.  At this moment, Johnny is getting the proverbial shit beat out of him. SUDDENLY, a new figure blurs INTO FRAME. \nBODHI seizes Bunker and flings him aside.  He spins with remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild's face. Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand.  The fight is still there in his eyes. \nBodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a raised hand and an evil look. \nBODHI Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go! \nBUNKER Stay outta this, Bodhi! \nBODHI He's with me.  Now back off. Seriously.Just do it! (they relax slightly) You alright Warchild? \nWARCHILD (holding his bleeding nose) Fuck you. \nEverybody has backed off a bit, panting. Utah steps toward Bunker.  Like he's maybe going to shake hands. \nUTAH What's your name? \nBUNKER Bunker. \nUTAH Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually kinda glad you found me. \nBUNKER Yeah?  Why? \nJohnny answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with a CRACK!  They can hear it in Pomona. BUNKER HITS THE GROUND.  Flat out.  Lights out. Tone, Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs. Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line of fire. \nBODHI Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give it a rest. (to Utah) Let's go. \nHe literally turns Utah around. They begin to walk, stepping over the pieces of Johnny's board. \nBODHI (under his breath) Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep walking. \nTone starts to go after them.  Archbold grabs his arm. They help Bunker up.  Warchild holds he bleeding nose. Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner and run HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS. The big man clocks a battered but intact Utah. We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a second. \nPAPPAS (out of breath) Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo? Stole the fucking CD too, you believe it? \nUtah is grateful for the cover. \nUTAH No, but there are four guys back there you might check out. \nPAPPAS Thanks, buddy. \nHe shoves on. \nEXT.  PARKING LOT \nBodhi and Utah weave among the cars and motorcycles, beach-types coming and going. \nUTAH Friends of yours, huh? \nBODHI The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here. \nUTAH What's their program? \nBODHI They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it. \nPappas pulls away from the curb, roaring past the other agents sedan.  Utah and Cole flip each other off perfunctorily as they pass. \nUTAH When did Harp say they'd have the warrant? \nPAPPAS He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nA bunker-like structure built of stone and glass on a cliff overlooking the Pacific.  Surfmobiles and motorcycles parked in front.  A strong backbeat thumps through the open front doors. Tyler's Porsche pulls into the driveway.  She and Johnny get out and head for the entrance. \nUTAH Nice place. \nTYLER He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride. \nINT./ EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE \nTyler leads Utah through the steady flow of SURF-RATS and other PCH NOMADS toward a large outdoor deck where a barbecue is in progress.  Moonlit waves pound the shore eighty feet below. \nThey are immediately distracted by the small crowd gathering around GROMMET who has his nose pressed flat against the center of a dart board. His eyes swivels back to ROACH, standing fifteen feet away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw. \nGROMMET Do your worst, man! \nRoach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle point of the dart, then squints at the target. ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets. \nSuddenly Roaches arm snaps back.  A collective hush... In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is airborne. \nTWAAAPPPPPP!  Bulls-eye.  Centimeters from flesh.  Grommet secretly exhales.  Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his head. The crowd goes wild. BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over. \nUTAH Don't you gamble? \nBODHI Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed. \nWith that, Bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into the crowd.  Utah watches them go, turns to Tyler. \nUTAH Who's the girl? \nTYLER Catch of the day. \nUTAH Oh, oh.  That sounds personal. \nTYLER People are expendable to Bodhi. \nUTAH Meaning you were expendable. \nTYLER (shrugs) We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. \nUTAH Sure, he's \"the Bodhisattva\". \nTYLER (she chuckles) Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. (thoughtful) Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover. \nUtah studies her a moment.  He's caught the faintest hint of regret in her voice.  But also the straight-ahead pragmatism.  He looks down at the waves pounding mercilessly against the rocks. \nUTAH All she does is beat the shit out of me. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPARTY - LATER \nLingering surf-rats stoned and drunk. Nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck, Corona in hand, gazing out at the black water.  He grins sloppily, body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a surfing stance. \nNATHANIEL (beer soaked speech) ... Okay, so you're in the face, it's twenty-five feet straight down, your balls are about this big. (like he's holding up two BB's) And the whole thing's moving, right, roaring like you're stuck to the front of a freight train.  There ain't nothin' like it, man.  The ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it doesn't even come close. \nROACH You lose it right then, you're history.  The fish'll be pickin' you outta the coral. \nNathaniel cackles that absurd Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  He starts to flail, arms pinwheeling. Utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him back.  Nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck. \nNATHANIEL (matter of factly) Thanks, brah. \nTyler sits next to Johnny, sipping a beer.  Bodhi is not in sight. \nROACH See, it's all dynamic, it's all in motion.  You can't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don't like the way things are going, y' know what I mean?  You gotta ride it out man, all the way. \nROACH (a voice in the distance) Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man! \nCLOSER, as moonlit figures run into the water. Utah stands on the beach, hoping his eyes will adjust. \nUTAH I can barely do this in broad daylight. \nTYLER Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are. \nJohnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the water. He strokes powerfully out through the black swell. \nUTAH'S EBONY BOARD pierces the wave and he slides down the backside to where the others are waiting.  Roach and Nathaniel, silhouettes nearby, see one they like and take off yelling. Johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him. \nUTAH I gotta be fucking crazy. \nBODHI Yeah, but are you crazy enough? \nGrommet gets a ride, slicing across in front of them. A ghost moving off into the silvery distance. Tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one.  It's Johnny's turn. \nBODHI Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave. \nUTAH I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here. \nBODHI I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win. \nUTAH A flaw I'm working on. \nBODHI The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see. \nUTAH Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated. \nBodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline. Without looking back, he senses the incoming swell. \nBODHI This one's got your name on it, Johnny. \nUtah looks.  Huge glassy face, perfectly formed.  Black and terrifying. \nBODHI Let's go. \nBodhi digs in with both hands, driving himself forward. Johnny starts grabbing water right behind him.  The wave picks them up. \nUTAH Shit, I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die now. \nJohnny uses the patented Tyler-pop and makes it to his feet.  Suddenly he's going like a shot. He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. Maintains a fragile control. On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black face. \nBodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed. \nJohnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face. \nFeeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it. \nThe Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face. \nHe falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing. \nTYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo wolf as they go by. She grins to herself, watching him. Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life. \nEXT.  BEACH PARKING LOT \nRosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement firepit. \nANGLE THROUGH THE HEAT HAZE above the flames.  Tyler punches through, a few feet away.  She paddles toward him, coming alongside. \nTYLER You had enough? \nUTAH Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute. \nHe watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle swell between sets lifts and drops them.  His face is somehow childlike. A slow grin spreads itself across his face. \nTYLER Look at you. \nUTAH What? \nTYLER Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. (she puts her fingertip to  his forehead) See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy. \nPAPPAS Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling. \nPappas pulls the loose Hawaiian shirt down over the radio- mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub. He steps out from behind a fence and walks along the sidewalk toward Bunker's house, two doors down.  He is wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a DOG LEASH. \nPAPPAS Here Scooby!  Where are you boy? Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of shit. \nCOLE AND MUNOZ snap around the corner of the garage and sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house. \nUTAH circles back out through the alley.  TRACKING WITH HIM as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab- walks toward Bunker's house.  BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying out of sight of the windows. \nANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this low-rent roach-hotel. \nJOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall hedge. He slides quietly in below a bedroom window. He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband.  Removes something from it.  A DENTAL MIRROR. Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside. \nTIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV. We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind. Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones.  Cranked up speedmetal. His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass. \nTIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it. \nUTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound.  He spins in a microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER. Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from Johnny's face.  Utah exhales and lowers the gun.  Wipes sweat from his eyes. \nTIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming as... \nTHE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before. She has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye-makeup and nails.  Ramones-style wardrobe.  She looks tense, and won't open the door very far. \nFIBERGLASS Yeah?  What? \nPAPPAS Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big. \nFIBERGLASS No. \nUTAH blinks at what he sees. \nHIS POV, in the little mirror. Like a silent pantomime under the ROAR OF THE MOWER, he sees Bunker and Warchild come flying into the room. They are hyper and manic.  Eyes wild. Bunker leaps clear over the bed. Grabs a COMBAT SHOTGUN from the closet.  Throws it to Warchild.  Tone is oblivious. Bunker thumps him in the chest and Tone leaps up like an overwound toy, gaping \"What the fuck?!\" we read his lips saying. Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO. \nUTAH (into his headset) Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there. They're pulling out a fucking arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole? Don't let him pull his badge! \nEXT.  BACK YARD \nCole and Munoz push their earpieces in deeper.  Scowl. \nMUNOZ Utah, say again.  What? (to Cole) I can't hear jack shit over this lawnmower.  Christ. \nINT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE \nIn the bedroom, Bunker looks through a slit of door at Fiberglass.  We hear Pappas just outside. \nPAPPAS (V.O.) ... and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard.  My wife'll kill me if I lose the little bastard.  Me, I could care less. Whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time... \nBunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive. \nBUNKER Something's goin' down, man.  This ain't right. \nTONE (freaked) No, man, it's nothin'.  It's nothin'. \nBUNKER Will you shut the fuck up!  Check the windows.  Do it!! \nEXT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE \nUtah sucks up against the wall as Warchild looks furtively out the window.  We see them both, but Warchild doesn't see Johnny, plastered right below him. Johnny closes his eyes and grits his teeth.  Shiiiiittt! \nPAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, is bobbing his head, trying to look inside. \nPAPPAS You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look? \nFIBERGLASS Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay-- \nPAPPAS Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him? \nFIBERGLASS There's nobody else here... \nINT.  HOUSE \nWarchild slams into the wall next to Bunker. \nUtah stares at the dope. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  POLICE HQ - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON WARCHILD manacled to the chair screaming his head off.  We cannot hear him through the glass.  It looks like pantomime. \nUTAH and PAPPAS watch through the one way observation window. THWAAAAAP!!  The two taped packets slam the wall inches from Utah's right ear.  Johnny snaps his head around. Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's meaner brother. And he's pissed as hell... \nDIETZ You know what this is?!  Two keys uncut crystal meth! \nUTAH What the hell's your problem? \nDietz manically grabs a clump of his stringy hair. \nDIETZ You think I like this haircut?  My wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I been working on these guys for THREE MONTHS!  Finally -- finally-- (nodding to Warchild) -- I get dickwad in there wantin' to play wheel of fortune so I can find out their supplier! \nHARP emerges from the interrogation room, we hear a sliver of Warchild's battle cry.  He spies Utah. \nHARP This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got a record of your suspect's movements every day for the last three months. \nDIETZ (stabbing the air with the packets) All I wanna know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up Tarzana City National on August 2nd, when they are in Fort-fucking- Lauderdale August 2ND!!! \nHARP Not an easy thing to do, is it, Utah? \nUTAH Aw shit. \nPAPPAS Nice tattoo, Dietz. \nWe hear a faint BUZZ, growing louder as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nThe doorbell BUZZ shrieks through the room.  It stops. Starts again.  A ghostly dawn finds UTAH and TYLER sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines. Johnny's eyes snap open.  Spies the clock.  4:00 a.m. Tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep. Johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to the door. \nBODHI stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin. Behind him NATHANIEL, ROACH and GROMMET hoot from the pickup. \nBODHI C'mon brah, there's a righteous swell.  Let's go!  Let's go! \nTyler comes into the room, wrapped in a sheet. Utah sees her knowing smile. \nTYLER He does this. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BEACH - PREDAWN \nVampire morning.  A misty predawn, bled of all color. Steel gray tones.  The ocean vanishes in the fog a few feet from shore. Tyler and Johnny, carrying their boards, walk toward the water. \nTYLER Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides. \nShe realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her, like a great weight has dragged him to a halt. \nTYLER What's wrong Johnny? (goes back to him) You're like a different person. \nHe stares at her.  His expression dark... wrestling with something. \nUTAH I am a different person, Tyler. \nHe lets out a long breath and looks away, out to sea. \nJOHNNY'S POV... the water receding into a backlit wall of mist. FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog. Shades of gray in the gray. IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen, their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other. \nSTACKED UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet and Nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical grace. \nIn SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at each other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other. Dolphins playing. Challenging each other in mock combat. So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe, by themselves.  It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon. \nTRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open. Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward him. \nIN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's shining white butt. \nReagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG. He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents charge past him.  Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the Mustang.  LBJ and JFK pile in. \nReagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the flame. Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle. \nLike an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant. Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated. Customers are running, screaming. Nixon has the Mustang fired up. \nNIXON Let's go!  Move it, Ronny! \nRonny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the scene with the jet of fire.  You can see it getting good to him.  In a second he's going to blow up the whole block.  But he's getting his rocks off.  He sets two other cars on fire. \nA FIGURE BLURS INTO FRAME. In a flying tackle, Utah catapults Reagan off his pins. They roll, skidding across the oily concrete. Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island. \nOut of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it. The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots blow out the back window. \nUtah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in half.  Drops to the cement. Reagan kicks him again and takes off running. The President is burning. His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he runs. \nGasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself out.  He comes up running, pulling his Beretta.  Sees the back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station. \nEXT.  ALLEY \nA non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one side, walled suburb on the other.  Two men running all out. A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter. \nBeyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES SKYWARD.  We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides. \nREAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode. \nAHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley. Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges.  Utah whips through the gate a second later. Diving into suburbia. \nINT./ EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE \nIt becomes a blur.  Pure kinetic energy.  Two meteors rocketing through a low-rent suburb.  And God help anyone who gets in the way. \nReagan crosses a cluttered backyard. Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god- knows-what. He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls. \nThey emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her. \nAHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear. \nReagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game. \nEverything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows. \nPanting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges. \nAcross the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on. \nREAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him. \nThe glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun. \nWOMAN Get the fuck out of this house! What the fuck do you think you're doing-- \nAround a corner.  A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND. Utah sees something flying at him.  Reflexively catches it. Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL. The Fierce Woman's fierce dog. \nUTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face. He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a doorway and runs on. Another door.  Another explosion of sunlight.  Another yard. Sprinklers this time.  Reagan and Utah running through sunlit walls of rain.  They crash through another hedge. Emerging drenched. \nThe ground drops away.  Slipping and sliding on iceplant, they skid down a steep slope.  Reagan reaches bottom. A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to pavement below. Reagan falls, landing on his feet. Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on. \nUtah rips down through the iceplant like a human lawnmower. Slides over the edge.  Falls -- lands hard. \nTIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION. Taking the impact. We HEAR something go. Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with pain. He grabs his tortured knee with both hands. \nUTAH Not now.  Not now! \nReagan runs on.  They are in an enclosed storage yard of some kind.  Ten foot chainlink all around. Utah struggles to get up and run. He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain. We see the incredible will driving him on. He gets up and again, hobbling.  Trying to run. \nReagan reaches the fence. He is heaving for breath.  Holding his side. Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee. Hobbling forward.  His eyes wild, the veins in his neck bulging. \nReagan starts to climb.  Utah collapses to his knees.  He can't go on. Reagan reaches the top of the fence.  He looks back. \nUTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM. Twenty feet away.  The muzzle rock-steady.  He can't miss. They both are frozen, panting.  Locked into the moment. \nREAGAN You want me, there's only one way. \nHe presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead. A kiss to each downcast eye.  Searching out her mouth with his own as his hands glide down the small of her back. Their reflection in the mirror as Utah slowly lowers Tyler to the bathroom floor.  She clings tightly in a breathless kiss. \nEXT.  CLIFF - NIGHT \nA Buddha in the moonlight, BODHI sits crosslegged upon the cliff, staring at the ocean. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND HIM, focusing in upon his eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nUTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X. WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light fall across the bed. Johnny doesn't stir. A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him. An outstretched arm holding a gun. Utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby. CAMERA TRACKS IN on his peaceful face. A single eyelid flutters.  Total silence, until... \nKABOOOOMMM!  The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a blizzard of goosedown.  Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth agape. TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand. \nTYLER A lawyer!?  You lied to me! \nShe throws his FBI gold star at his face. \nTYLER Look, Tyler, I can-- \nBOOM!  Tyler SQUEEZES off another round. Cascading goosefeathers falling like snow. Utah flinches sideways. \nTYLER Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it? \nUTAH Tyler, put the gun down. \nTYLER You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?! \nShe waves the Beretta in his face. \nUTAH No.  They live in Columbus Ohio. \nTyler lowers the pistol slowly, the strength leaving her. Her face begins to flood with tears. \nUTAH I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not-- \nTYLER Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell! \nShe goes limp as the sobs rack her body.  The gun flops from her grip. Utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot. He moves to gently comfort her. She bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom. Utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her.  He stumbles. \nUTAH Tyler!  Wait!! \nFrom the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front door opens and slams shut.  He hobbles to the door, favoring his knee.  Opens it.  We hear the Porsche screeching away. Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow. \nCUT TO: \nUTAH on the bed staring up at the ceiling.  Phone cradled, listening to-- \nTYLER (V.O.) Hi, it's me.  Leave a message. \nBEEP!  He rests the telephone on his chest, letting the tape roll a moment before he speaks. \nUTAH Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay. I know I fucked up.  I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't -- I was afraid you'd leave... good guess, huh? (grimacing) Fuck, why can't I ever say what I really mean?  I lied to you.  I'm an asshole... but I need you, Tyler.  I want you to know that I've never known anyone like you before in my life... and I... I hope you change your mind... \nHe cradles the receiver, looks out the window.  Black of night.  Dead still. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nUTAH asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest. \nBUZZZZZZ!  The rasp of the doorbell. Johnny is airborne, phone flying across the floor. Hunting for his pants, realizes they are already on, limps in fast motion to the door. \nUTAH Tyler!  Wait, I-- \nWhips it open. BODHI standing in the doorway, smiling like an excited child. \nBODHI Howdy brah. \nNATHANIEL, ROACH, and GROMMET are there behind him. They look like sentry dogs.  Johnny freezes. Bodhi walks past Utah, into the room. \nBODHI C'mon, get your gear on, we're rollin'. \nCheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance. He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor. Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain sight. He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it. \nUtah's gaze travels beyond the windshield. Where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  DESERT AIRSTRIP \nTIGHT ON A turbo-prop engine ROARING. \nWIDER reveals a big Cessna twin.  The PILOT, a weaselly guy we haven't seen before, fires up the second engine. The plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light. A desert airstrip near Palmdale.  A couple of aluminum- siding hangers and no tower.  A few other planes around but no activity besides Bodhi's rock-steady crew. \nUTAH watches Grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of Bodhi's truck and starts tossing out PARACHUTE PACKS. Roach tosses one to Bodhi, who chucks it to Utah. \nBODHI Ever done this before? \nUTAH Once. \nBODHI Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump. \nUTAH Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday-- \nBODHI Yeah, I noticed you limping. (grins) But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land! \nBodhi grabs his sleeve, ushering him into the plane. \nUTAH Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel so much better. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CESSNA \nUtah sits, wearing a day-glo jump suit, hugging the chute in his lap.  Next to him is the gaping door.  Beyond... a spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet.  ROAR of wind and engines. \nUtah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling into their colorful freefall suits.  Nathaniel pulls on a pair of purple shorts over his suit.  Looks real dorky. Grommet has on duck feet.  Bodhi, apparently, is going to jump barefoot. Nobody has their chutes on yet. Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the contents.  His brain is racing.  Bodhi shouts over the roar. \nBODHI It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar. \nUTAH So, who... uh, who packed my chute? \nBODHI I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me? \nUTAH You gotta earn trust. \nBODHI Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine. \nBodhi swaps chutes with Johnny. Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly. Is this a game?  Poker moves? Did Bodhi anticipate this step? \nROACH Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man. His pack-jobs suck... they only open half the time.  Take Grommet's, man. \nRoach's grin is evil as he grabs Grommet's chute out of his hands and switches it with Johnny's.  Keeps that one and gives his to Grommet. \nGROMMET Whoa, unfair, dude! \nGrommet grabs his chute back and hands Johnny the one he had, which was Roach's.  I think. Johnny looks at the pack in his hands.  Then at the grinning faces. Russian surfer freefall roulette.  Shit. Bodhi studying him.  Some kind of test. Fuck it.  Utah starts putting the damn thing on. \nUTAH We gonna jump or jerk off? \nBODHI My man! \nEXT.  10,000 FEET - DAWN \nMulti-colored figures explode from the plane.  Leaping into freefall.  Tumbling end over end. WEARING HEADSETS, they hurtle downward. \nBODHI (RADIO) Utah, you copy bruddah? \nUTAH (RADIO) Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah! \nBODHI I'll take that as a yes. \nOne by one they stabilize.  Falling face down, knees bent, they angle their hands and feet minutely to move laterally.  Utah flails, the last to trim out.  But he's holding his own. \nGrommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive.  He flares out and \"flies\" back to the others. Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on a separate plane of existence. A hurricane of wind.  Wild HOOTING. Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel, falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube in the pool. \nROACH Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with the cosmos! \nUtah lunges, pinning Bodhi to the wall of the van... an elbow across his throat. \nUTAH You're a fucking dead man-- \nBODHI (gasping for breath) Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second. \nJohnny pulls back.  Barely in control. \nUTAH Talk. \nBODHI She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... (he looks at his dive Rolex) ... six hours from now. \nUtah's voice sounds kind of strangled. \nUTAH You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go. \nBODHI Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there. \nUtah blanches as he takes this in.  Knows Bodhi well enough now to know he means business. \nBODHI So that makes us partners, doesn't it?  Because now we both have the same goal... to get me where I need to go.  Right? \nUtah's expression turns suddenly cold as an executioner's. \nUTAH We're wasting time. \nBODHI See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade. \nBodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others, gathered nearby.  He addresses the pilot first... \nBODHI Get the plane down to Santa Monica and top up the tanks. (to the others) Let's go.  Let's saddle up! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  L.A. STREETS - DAY \nA STYLIZED LONG LENS SHOT stacks the cars into a dreamlike mirage.  The van weaves slowly among them with predatory stealth. \nBODHI (V.O.) Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety seconds of your life, Johnny. That's all. \nINT.  VAN \nEXTREME CLOSEUP ON the velcro straps of Second Chance armor.  Tanned fingers cinch it tight.  A SHELL slides into the cylinder of the Casull.  A SHOTGUN is cocked. KACHACK! \nBODHI It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If you scare them, get them pissing down their leg, they submit... you control them.  If you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt. \nWIDER, revealing that Bodhi is in the back with Utah and Roach. Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front. The duffels contents are strewn around.  Masks.  Weapons. They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets.  Tying ties.  Slipping on white gloves.  Snappy Oxfords. Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR. Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.  He works with vicious, jerky moves.  His jaw locked.  Eyes down. \nBODHI Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.  You project strength to avoid conflict. \nROACH Peace through superior firepower, babe. \nBodhi conspicuously empties all the shells from a PUMP 12 GAUGE. Pockets the shells.  Tosses the weapon to Utah. \nBODHI Here, you need this.  You can't be comin' through that door with your dick in your hands, right? \nUTAH I can't do this. \nBODHI Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U? \nUTAH Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!! \nBODHI Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master? \nGROMMET Fuckin' A! \nBODHI Ninety seconds, man, door to door. A small price to pay for someone who loves you. (he looks up) She does you know.  It's not her style to fall so hard... I don't think she did with me. \nHe pulls the Ronald Reagan mask over his head smoothly. Roach pulls his on.  NIXON.  Nathaniel becomes KENNEDY. Grommet transforms into LBJ. Bodhi looks in the bag -- no more masks. \nBODHI Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get to be president. \nJOHNNY'S POV -- the back doors of the van.  And the promise of what is beyond.  Bodhi enters FRAME.  Looks straight at us. \nTIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster. The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop. \"Don't make me do this\". The guy is sweating, shaking.  A yellow liquid spreads across the tiles next to his quivering hips.  He's actually pissing himself, he's so scared. \nTIGHT ON the off-duty cop.  Watching like a ferret.  He cocks his .38. ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror. \nIt happens like lightning.  The cop pops to his knees, straight-arming the .38.  The guard goes for his ankle holster. REAGAN spins. The cop FIRES.  BLAM! Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact. He crashes onto a desk on his back.  Slides off, scattering papers. A teller screams.  The cop spins toward Utah. Johnny throws down the shotgun.  Shows his palms.  He's holding out his gold star. \nUTAH Federal agent!  Undercover! \nThe cop FIRES TWICE.  Two in the chest.  Utah is hurled back.  Slams into the tellers' counter. \nNATHANIEL/LBJ lets go with the 12 gauge.  BOOM! The cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets. The guard caps-off like a maniac.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!!! All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down behind a check-writing island. \nROACH/NIXON LEAPS THE COUNTER and lands behind the guard. The guard's shoulder explodes as Roach's 12 gauge detonates.  He pitches onto his face, screaming and holding the wreckage of his upper arm. Grommet/LBJ is coming over the counter behind Roach as the off-duty cop spins and fires.  BLAM!  BLAM!  Roach takes it in the chest.  Staggers back, firing into the floor. Trips and drops his shotgun. Grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his fingers. \nIN SLOW MOTION Reagan's face rises above the counter. The mask is askew.  In order to see, Bodhi pulls it off. The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as-- \nTHE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around, nightmarishly slow as-- \nBODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and-- KABOOOOM!!!  The world's most powerful handgun proves its claim at 2000 feet per second. \nA gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest. He is lifted off his feet.  Hits and slides across the floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear. Echoes slap the walls.  Then all is still.  Plaintive whimpering and moaning.  The air is blue with smoke. \nJohnny is trying to catch his breath.  He rips his shirt open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance vest.  Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh.  But no blood. \nBodhi drops over the counter near Utah. The two men look at each other. Bodhi's eyes seem lost.  He stares around at the carnage he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game. His expression changes to something new -- truly crazed now.  We feel that the madness which has been held in check so long has been let off its leash. \nBODHI Don't anybody fucking move! \nRoach, clutching his side, moves to Grommet, who is on his knees. Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows down Grommet's chest.  Roach pulls off the mask. Revealing a terrified kid. Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his throat, stares at it bug-eyed. \nGROMMET Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all comin' out man, gotta stop it... it's all gonna come out... do something!! \nHe's trying to hold it in with his hands.  This doesn't work. A paste-white frightened kid.  Eighteen years old. Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game.  That death is real. He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness. WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING. \nROACH (freaking to Bodhi) We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin' it bad on this one.  Let's go! \nBodhi reaches down and picks up Johnny's FBI shield off the floor. He considers it for a long time.  Then looks up at Johnny. His eyes seem to ask for forgiveness... A moment before he smashes the Casull into Johnny's skull. \nJOHNNY'S POV, as he drops to his knees.  Everything going dark as we see Bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving slowly... \nBODHI Goodbye, Johnny. \nThe floor rushes up and smashes us in the face. A view of shoes, running away from us, leaving bloody footprints.  Then total darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT./ EXT.  FIRST SECURITY BANK - LATER \nTen minutes later the bank \"crime scene\" is in full swing. UNIFORM COPS are everywhere, trying to get statements from sobbing witnesses.  HARP, MUNOZ, COLE AND PAPPAS represent the FBI contingent.  Cole has one arm strapped to his body in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly. \nHarp is barking orders to everyone in sight.  Outside (visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of rubberneckers.  A MINICAM CREW shows up.  Harp starts shouting at them. \nCOLE, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of handcuff's on Utah's wrists with his good hand.  Johnny has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling into his eyes, but he seems not to notice.  Not to hear MUNOZ speaking monotonously-- \nMUNOZ -- if you so desire, an attorney will be provided for you free of cost.  Do you understand these rights I have explained to you? Utah? \nPappas charges through the crowd, pushing Munoz aside. \nPAPPAS He knows his goddamn rights! (looks at Utah) Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting too close to these guys. (turns to the other agents) Gimme the goddamn key to these things, Cole.  Christ! \nHe gestures to the cuffs still cutting into Johnny's wrists. Cole hands him the key. Harp storms toward them. \nHARP Don't take those off.  Just leave them on!  Your partner's an accessory to murder.  You realize that? \nHarp spins Johnny by the shoulder to look at-- Paramedics carrying the covered body of the off-duty cop. Beyond, still on the floor, is Grommet, his eyes staring in death. He was right about not making thirty. \nHARP Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah? \nUTAH (cold and scary) Take your hand off my shoulder right now. \nHarp pulls back instinctively.  Utah's eyes burn into him. Looks like Johnny's not in the FBI anymore. \nPAPPAS Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in. \nUTAH Shit may or may not happen. \nUTAH Look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine!  But don't take her with you, man.  I'm begging you... tell me where she is.  Then I walk away.  We've earned that much trust, haven't we? \nThe pilot opens the door and is climbing out when Nathaniel wheels on him.  The pilot goes cross-eyed staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his face. \nBODHI (to the pilot) Back in the hotseat, campadre. NOW! \nBEHIND THE TRUCKS, Pappas senses something. His head snaps around. Roach is behind him with the 12 gauge.  He FIRES. Pappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches into the truck fender.  Some of it catches Pappas in the hip.  He hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 BAM! BAM!  BAM! Roach flips onto his back. The shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck. Pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the others. \nNATHANIEL fires once, wild.  Terrified.  His shot blows a divot out of the asphalt next to Pappas. He pumps the slide, chambering another round. Then Pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him. He slams back against the Cessna's fuselage. Slides down.  Two red smears on the white aircraft. Bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge. Pappas takes aim.  One round left. Utah sprints between them. \nUTAH Angelo!  Don't fire! \nPAPPAS Kid, get outta the way!! \nUTAH NOOO!! \nUtah is blocking Bodhi with his body. Bodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the shotgun. Standoff. \nPAPPAS GODDAMMIT!! \nHe snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky. Pappas stands panting.  Enraged and frustrated.  Pain searing his leg.  Everything is tense and electrified. BOOM!!  Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood! \nBEHIND HIM, ROACH is lying on one elbow in a pool of scarlet. He cocks another round into the chamber and fires again. BOOM! \nAngelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like he's hugging himself.  Johnny lunges toward him, his face distorted with shock. \nUTAH NNNOOOOOO!!! \nAngelo's eyes meet his for a moment. In his dilated pupils is the great question. Then he slumps forward and lies very still. The breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in. \nJohnny moves toward his friend in a daze.  Drops to one knee beside him. Roach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood. Utah doesn't notice.  Or is beyond caring. Bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction. Roach's finger relaxes on the trigger. \nUtah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair. He hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as Bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge. \nRoach is working himself to his knees.  His breath is sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the customary breathing orifices.  Bodhi crosses to him and helps him up.  He covers Utah with the shot gun as he half-carries Roach to the plane.  The pilot is white with shock.  He'd run if he could remember how. \nPILOT I ain't flyin' you guys to San Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now-- \nBODHI Thanks for telling the nice FBI agent where we're going. \nRoach works his way up into the plane.  He waves the shotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood-flecked mask. \nROACH Get in the fucking plane. \nBodhi stands behind Johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head. Their expressions are lethally cold. We see that Utah hates this man who was his friend, his teacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate. \nBODHI We're gonna ride this out, all the way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go. \nJohnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all somehow pre-ordained, and that they both knew the game would take them this far and beyond.  He stands and walks to the plane. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MEXICO - DAY \nTHE SCREEN EXPLODES WITH A BLUR OF MOTION. POV of the ground racing below us at 180 mph. \nREVERSE, preceding the plane as it rockets through barren canyons. As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it. Under the radar. \nINT.  PLANE \nThe aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and banks wildly. Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from the jump seat just behind him. Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in the rear seats. Roach is a pale, sweaty mask.  He is propped against a bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a discarded coat. His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood. But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into Utah's guts. No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride. \nEXT.  ARROYO \nNear noon.  The sun blisters a landscape out of time. The white Cessna rockets above the saguaros, its shadow pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some manic alter ego below it.  It WOOSHES over us, raising dust devils. \nINT.  PLANE \nThe pilot yells over his shoulder to Bodhi... \nPILOT Look, we been in Mexico the last half hour... can I quit mowing the lawn here or what?  I'm getting more brush in the wheels than I usually like, you know what I'm saying?! \n", "test1_input": "EXT.  BEACH - DAWN \nUTAH & TYLER walk across the sand. Tyler drops her board. \nTYLER Stop here. (she turns to him) Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it? \nUTAH Sure. \nCUT TO: \nUTAH pops INTO FRAME, arms extended, one leg in front of the other, torso bent at the waist: classic surfing stance. Suddenly, he drops OUT OF FRAME. \nWE PULL BACK -- Revealing Utah on his board, on the sand. \nTYLER Do it again. \nTyler is making him \"pop\" up to his feet.  Again and again.  GAWKERS stop to watch.  Utah fights humiliation. He pops again.  And again.  Quick cuts. On the next pop we-- \nPULL BACK to reveal Utah on his board, in a wave.  He is surfing. For about three seconds.  He flies off the deck, ass over teakettle. On the SPLASH we start-- \nA SEQUENCE OF TIME CUTS \nTyler and Utah straddle their boards outside the break. She nods as the set comes, mellow right tubes.  Utah digs in, arms pumping. He feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and starts down the wall. And endos. \nCLOUDY PLATINUM DAWN... Tyler shouting at Utah as he fights for balance. He flies off again. \nBLINDING BRIGHT SUNRISE.  TYLER NEXT TO UTAH in the lineup, straddling boards.  She moves her hands like a fighter pilot explaining a dogfight maneuver.  Utah watches intently. \nUtah, backlit in glorious slow motion, tries a little turn and feels his feet slip out.  He slams down butt-first on the board, flips over, feet sticking straight up out of a blast of diamond spray. Tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless. \nTYLER AND UTAH, at their cars, skinning out of their wetsuits.  Utah looks exhausted, downcast.  She snaps her wet towel at his ass, cheering him up. \nMALIBU PIER.  RAIN.  Tyler jumps out of her Porsche and sees Utah sitting in his car.  She goes to him, opens the door and starts pulling him out.  Come on you pussy. \nUTAH and TYLER wait their turn in the lineup.  Rain pelts their faces.  The waves are depressing inside mushers under a gray sky. Utah starts to paddle.  Tyler shakes her head no.  Utah is committed to the I'face.  Tyler stifles a laugh. \nTYLER (to the other surfers) I'm not with him. \nJohnny gouges the lip, pops and begins the drop. Suddenly, miraculously, he catches an edge and, still standing, is carried along the tiny wall. \nThe wall begins to sag.  Utah shoots along the mush hooting and continues hooting madly as he thrashes all the way to shore. He turns and grins foolishly out to sea. Tyler bursts out laughing. \nEXT.  MALIBU PIER - DUSK \nBig surf.  Rough conditions.  Closeout set. UTAH, board in arm, follows Tyler out of the whitewater onto the beach. \nTYLER It's closing out completely.  Let's call it. \nUtah nods.  His eyes track the unruly break. \nUTAH Who's that? \nA LONE SURFER slashing through the pilings of the pier.  A real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind him. SILHOUETTED against a crimson sky and backlit spray the figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion that is somehow balletic. Laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car window on the freeway. \nTYLER (V.O.) That's Bodhi.  They call his the Bodhisattva. \nUtah watches as THE BODHISATTVA gets vertical with a snap, trims down the volcanic wall, carves the bottom, pivots, pumps to the top, gouging the lip, getting six feet of air. Gawkers HOWL and shout praise at the manic surfer. \nTYLER The modern savage.  Guy's even crazier than you, Johnny Utah. C'mon. \nThey start to walk.  The sky darkens as the sea finally closes out completely.  The Bodhisattva seems to levitate through the shapeless mush to shore. \nROACH (O.S.) Brah! \nSuddenly a football whistles through the air above Utah's head. He watches as-- The Bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the whitewater, makes a one-handed chest catch. \nA few yards away two teams of SURFERS play football. Utah gazes down the beach at the Bodhisattva. Almost 30 years old, his body lean and hard as a tree trunk.  Hardness in the face accented by long Comanche hair. \nBODHI Hey Tyler! \nShe whirls.  Bodhi pumps his arm.  Tyler jogs back for the catch.  Bullseye.  She shoots Bodhi a look.  Something crosses her face. Bodhi smiles.  Tyler doesn't.  Then it passes. She chucks the ball to Utah. Who drops his board and makes the catch in one move. He SPINS the football on his fingertip, drops it on his foot, kicks it up into his hands.  Razzle dazzle.  He grins evilly. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "MONTAGE STYLE -- Utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling passes.  Every one picture perfect.  Nathaniel scrambles z-out left, turns and the ball is practically waiting for him.  Touchdowns galore.  Endzone dancing.  Bodhi stares at him curiously. \nTyler rushes.  Utah enjoys scrambling, ducking left and right, twisting her into a pretzel.  Play after play. Utah tosses another touchdown, but Tyler keeps coming. Sacking him. They lie together in a heap, laughing. \nBodhi quarterbacks.  Utah rushes.  Bodhi fakes a pass then runs, ball tucked in his arm.  Utah tears after him.  Flat out speed run. Roach attempts a block.  Utah hits him like a freight train. Roach hits the sand face first. Grommet and Rosie the biker in a squeeze play. Utah, fierce now, blasts between them.  No mercy. Utah can't play for fun.  We see his expression. Something scary there.  What we will call \"juggernaut mode\". Tyler just steps aside. \nBodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the beach.  Looks back.  Sees a demon shooting up roostertails of spray behind him, gaining.  Pours it on.  Both of them pistoning through curtains of water.  Not a game anymore. Closing on the endzone.  5 yards.  Utah is airborne. SLAMS BODHI LIKE A SAM MISSILE.  They crash and burn together in the surf. \nThe other surfers run up.  Who's this newcomer that just centerpunched their main man?  Industrial strength tension. \nROACH The fuck you doin' man?!  You fuckin' crazy? \nBodhi flashes a million dollar smile. \nBODHI Chill, brah.  You know who this is? Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all- conference. (to Utah) Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right? \nJohnny nods.  Tyler looks at him -- no shit? \nROACH Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A! Yeah, I remember that game, man. You were on-fire.  They could not stop your ass. \nGROMMET Radical!  Head-butt, dude!! \nJohnny gestures \"Please no\". Enthused by the concept, Grommet turns to Nathaniel. \nGROMMET Head-butt!!! \nThey do.  Their foreheads CRACK together.  They stumble backwards in giddy euphoria.  Nathaniel laughs like Pee Wee Herman. \nBODHI Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter. \nUTAH Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way. \nBODHI And that's why you never went pro? \nUTAH Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead. \nBODHI Mmm.  A lawyer, huh? (like it's a disease) Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right? \nUTAH Not yet. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - 16TH FLOOR - DAY \nUtah, in shorts and T-shirt, carries his flame-job surfboard past surveillance cameras and portraits of Bush, Hoover and Webster.  Special Agent Cole walks by.  Eyes the board.  Speaks deadpan. \nCOLE Like totally rad stick, dude. \nINT.  BULLPEN \nUtah tries to act casual as he carries the board to his desk on the other side of the room.  He has to walk past the entire gauntlet to get there. \nSEVERAL AGENTS Gnarly, man... hang ten... cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it up! \nHarp comes straight for him like a homing missile. \nHARP How was the beach? \nUTAH Fine. \nHARP Surf conditions okay? \nUTAH A little mushy. \nHARP A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls? \nUTAH Babes. \nHARP What? \nUTAH The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean. \n", "test1_id": 918, "test2_input": "PAPPAS Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report. \nUTAH Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one. \nAngelo looks at the conviction in the other agent's eyes. Pappas sighs and puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder. \nPAPPAS Alright, look... banks are closed. Nothing's gonna go down tonight, right?  So we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow. Okay? \nUtah nods.  Then grins.  Pappas starts backing up, like a long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him back into the house. \nUTAH Woof, woof. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET NEAR BODHI'S HOUSE - DAY \nLONG LENS POV scanning Bodhi's house.  There is a \"FOR RENT\" sign out front.  The driveway and carpet are empty... no vehicles in sight. \nUTAH (V.O.) They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We missed them. \nUTAH LOWERS HIS BINOCULARS.  He's standing next to the car while Pappas sits on the hood, sipping coffee from a thermos. \nPAPPAS They're on their way to Maui. \nUTAH No way.  Not yet.  Come on. \nUtah jumps in and starts the car.  Pappas is screwing the cap on the thermos.  Johnny puts the car in gear, forcing Angelo to scramble in as the car starts to roll. \nPAPPAS Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't open 'till nine. \nEXT.  CITY STREET - TRAFFIC - DAY \nJohnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters. Long glittering lines and heat waves. \nUTAH I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me. \nPAPPAS Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard. \nUTAH I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in. \nPAPPAS Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ASSURED TRUST SAVING AND LOAN \nSLOW PAN from the facade of the bank halfway up the block to Utah's sedan in the TIGHT F.G.  Head flopped back over the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page over his face.  Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth time.  Whole lot of nothing going on. \nAngelo slides the sports page down to his chin, without otherwise moving. \nPAPPAS Time for lunch. \nUTAH Angelo, it's eleven thirty. \nPAPPAS That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two. \nUtah slides out of the car.  Feeling a little exposed he pulls his Dodgers cap down a little tighter, and adjusts his sunglasses. He trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST- FOOD STAND nearby. Pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FAST FOOD PLACE \nON A LONG LENS, very stacked up, we see Johnny standing at the grody pick-up window.  He keeps looking at the bank, visible B.G. The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out. Utah turns, pulling out his wallet. \nVOICE FROM INSIDE Two meatball, one tuna on wheat, two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty four. \nAs Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front of the bank.  The doors fly open. The Ex-Presidents jump out. They sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G. Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order. The Presidents disappear inside. Johnny looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement. \nREVERSE, as Utah walks back toward his car.  Pappas is still under the paper.  He slides it down when he smells food. \nUTAH Here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill.  Enjoy. \nUtah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into Pappas' lap.  Still standing next to the car. \n", "test2_true": "Pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag, unwrapping one end. \nPAPPAS (without looking) Damn, I could eat the ass out of an elephant.  I shoulda had you get me three a these.  What T-Bird? \nPappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls out of the end of the sandwich.  It lands on the seat next to him. He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it into his mouth and-- Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on... The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the doors of the bank 80 feet away. \nJohnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about two seconds.  Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes bugging. \nPAPPAS Jesus Christ!!  It's them! \nThe Presidents are piling into the car. Johnny reacts characteristically.  He whips out the Beretta and yells-- \nUTAH FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now! \nNIXON spins, raising his shotgun. But Reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand.  Shoves him into the car.  Then Reagan jumps behind the wheel. The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches. \nUtah FIRES. BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM! He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping a Subaru which locks them up and spins. \nPAPPAS Come on, kid, get in the car! Jesus! \nINT./ EXT.  SEDAN \nPappas reaches across, starting the engine as Johnny jumps in the driver's side.  Utah buries the throttle into the firewall and charges aggressively through the medium traffic. Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler, fishtailing.  It straightens out.  No T-Bird in sight. \nUTAH The hell are they?! \nPAPPAS They took a left at the next light! \nUTAH You sure?! \nUtah is totally wired.  Totally concentrated.  The adrenalin is kicking in, flashing through his system.  His brain is on turbo boost, reacting a thousand times a second as they hit sixty through the traffic, which seems to be standing still. \nUTAH I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it, I'm on it. \nHigh-speed slalom through cars and trucks. The world passes by in a hysterical blur. \nPAPPAS You even watching the road? \nA car pulls out, straight ahead. Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him.  The guy's bumper and front grille are removed.  Utah does a smoking skid-recovery.  Doesn't even slow down. \nThe late model T-Bird is weaving manically.  It makes a sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the FBI agents. \nUtah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot. Pedestrians scatter.  Utah center-punches a week's supply of groceries in a cart. \nINT./ EXT.  T-BIRD \nThe Presidents hold on desperately as Reagan white- knuckles it through civilian traffic.  They're looking all around, trying to see where Utah went. \nLBJ Where are they, man?  I don't see 'em.  We lose 'em? \nNot exactly... THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see an airborne Utah hurtling from a Ralph's entrance.  The sedan lands on the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the undercarriage. An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird. \nThe two cars spin out of control.  Utah cuts the wheel, slamming into them again.  Side by side demolition derby. WHAM!!  Utah hits them again.  The Presidents lose control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in the process. \nUtah's car starts to swap ends.  Hit the center island broadside. The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off. \nPAPPAS Nice fuckin' work, hotshot. Christ! \nThey can see the T-Bird still moving. It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on flapping rubber. \nJohnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back in broken glass.  Pappas is packed in, upside down, wriggling to get out through the side window.  A tight fit. \nINT./ EXT.  T-BIRD \nThe Presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing tire. \nREAGAN Emergency sanitization!  Here we go! \nEXT.  GAS STATION \nThe T-Bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a smoking stop at one of the pump islands.  The Presidents explode out of the car in a blur. \n", "test2_id": 919, "test3_input": "UTAH No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!! \nBODHI Naw, you pull it! \nUtah looks down.  The earth is rushing at them.  2500 feet. \nBODHI Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? \nUTAH Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! \nBODHI Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four... \n1000 feet.  The ground is close enough to see details. Cactus, sagebrush.  They rocket past the bright yellow canopy of Roach's chute a hundred feet away. \nUTAH You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!! \nThey're right in each other's faces.  Taking it way beyond the edge. Bodhi's eyes are wild.  A gleeful, adrenalized madness... his pupils are the entrance to Hell. \nBODHI Three seconds... two... one... \nUTAH SHIT!! \nUtah flings the Casull away and pulls the rip-cord so hard he almost loses his grip anyway.  POOM!  The canopy cracks out. Full and round and bright red. The ground roars at us. WHAP!  Utah and Bodhi hit.  Hard. \nThey slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a cloud of dust. Rocks and debris clatter into silence. \nNEARBY Roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll. He moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his eyes stare without blinking right at the sun.  Next to him the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the sand.  Roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills that caper in the desert wind. \nUTAH AND BODHI are both completely still as the dust clears.  Finally they groan and stir.  Necks move, hands move, legs move.  Bodhi rolls to his knees.  He is cut and scraped, the blood running bright down his dust-covered skin. \nUtah looks around, blinking. Surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red-hot Mexican desert. Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him. \nBODHI Wild ride, huh? \nUTAH (gasping) Jesus Christ, Bodhi! \nUtah tries to rise and -- grabs his knee in agony.  We see by his mask of pain that it's totaled inside. \nBODHI That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad. \nHe looks up at the sound of an engine. \nBODHI'S POV of his big four-by roaring toward us with a meteor tail of dust.  It slides to a stop next to them. Rosie gets out of the driver's side and stands calmly with a sawed-off over his shoulder. \nUtah blinks through his sweat and pain at-- \nTYLER running toward him out of the dust.  She kneels next to him and puts her arms around him.  Bodhi limps to the truck.  Through the swirling dust we see him look back. \nBODHI You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U. \nHe swings up into the four-by and guns the engine.  Rosie hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward Roach's billowing gravemarker. \nJohnny touches Tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of blood. He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin. \nHOLD ON the truck moving off in a heat-shimmered cloud of dust, becoming a mirage, then a memory as we-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nAN ENORMOUS WAVE which FILLS FRAME, seeming to rise endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray. \nEXT.  BEACH DAY - DAY \nAn unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a storm sky. Wind whips sand across the narrow beach-road, throwing it against the front doors of the LIGHTHOUSE PUB. TITLE OVER: ONE YEAR LATER... \nINT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY \nDark.  Almost empty.  A snarling crocodile head is mounted above a tapper of Guinness Stout.  A Koala bear with plastic eyes holds a Foster's.  A BARTENDER with leathered skin washes glasses. At the bar, a single disheveled customer... human driftwood. GUST OF WIND blows open a shuttered window. The bartender moves to close it. \nBARTENDER Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore the bloody storm hits. \nJOHNNY UTAH swivels toward CAMERA.  His tanned face is barely recognizable, jaws hidden underneath a slight beard, long bleach-out hair swept behind an ear.  His muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey. The man seems deadly focused. \nUTAH Storm's already here... It's bringing me the swell. \n", "test3_true": "TYLER John, they're here. \nUtah downs the drink and slides off his stool.  He has a pronounced limps as he crosses to Tyler at the door. They exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which reads: LIGHTHOUSE PUB - BELL'S BEACH, AUSTRALIA \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY \nUTAH and TYLER walk out onto the roadway as several Australian Police cars converge on them.  A dozen uniformed OFFICERS step out.  The ranking officer, a fortyish LIEUTENANT, walks up to Utah. \nLIEUTENANT D'you see him, Mr. Utah? \nUTAH No.  But he's here. \nLIEUTENANT Now, look, I know you used to be a federal agent up in the states and all that, but you're a citizen now, so just find him and we'll handle it from there. \nUTAH No problem.  Just give me a couple minutes with him first. \nJohnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BELL'S BEACH - AUSTRALIA - DAY \nWALL OF SOLID WATER FIVE STORIES HIGH CRASHES straight down in a holocaust of spray... Rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky, roll the most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen.  They close out, pummeling the ocean floor, casting a shockwave up the shore. SURFERS gather on the sand, gaze out to sea. \n1ST SURFER Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's shakin'. \nThe beach sounds like a MORTAR RANGE. JOHNNY passes among the brahs. \n2ND SURFER Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin' death on a stick. \nON BODHI, sitting crosslegged in the sand, arms folded around his knees.  He stares pensively out at the waves. His hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard lying next to him. \nUTAH (V.O.) I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty year storm, Bodhi. \nBodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates the cunning of his opponent.  Utah sits beside his prey and stares at the ocean.  Bodhi stares with glittering eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into that feral, death's head grin. \nBODHI And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah. \nUTAH I'm not FBI anymore. \nBODHI You never were... \nUTAH I asked them to give me a couple minutes... \nUtah calmly glances over his shoulder. Bodhi follows Johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the road. \nBODHI It went bad, brah.  Real bad. (smiles inwardly) I just felt it was time... \nA BOOMING ROAR sounds from the ocean. Bodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear. \nBODHI Time to dance with the universe. (he turns to Utah) I could never handle a jail cell. You'll do this for me, won't you Johnny?  Haven't I earned this much? \nUtah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the longboard. He half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts walking. He stops.  Turns around. \nBODHI Thanks, brah. \nBodhi doesn't wait for a reply.  He walks to the water's edge, and never looks back.  He throws his board into the foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out.  The monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the trough of the holocaust. \nUTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver final justice.  The cops are running clumsily across the sand, too late to stop Bodhi.  Tyler steps up behind Johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders. \nBODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his mouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer- limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect union... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish. \nUTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf. Tyler lowers her head.  A fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand.  The wind gathers force. Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her shoulder, gathering her close.  Tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea. \nUTAH He rode it all the way. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high above their heads as the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the Australian shore... \nFADE TO BLACK \n", "test3_id": 920}

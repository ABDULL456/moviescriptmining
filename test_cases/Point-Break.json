{"test1_input": "PAPPAS Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling. \nPappas pulls the loose Hawaiian shirt down over the radio- mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub. He steps out from behind a fence and walks along the sidewalk toward Bunker's house, two doors down.  He is wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a DOG LEASH. \nPAPPAS Here Scooby!  Where are you boy? Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of shit. \nCOLE AND MUNOZ snap around the corner of the garage and sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house. \nUTAH circles back out through the alley.  TRACKING WITH HIM as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab- walks toward Bunker's house.  BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying out of sight of the windows. \nANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this low-rent roach-hotel. \nJOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall hedge. He slides quietly in below a bedroom window. He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband.  Removes something from it.  A DENTAL MIRROR. Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside. \nTIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV. We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind. Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones.  Cranked up speedmetal. His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass. \nTIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it. \nUTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound.  He spins in a microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER. Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from Johnny's face.  Utah exhales and lowers the gun.  Wipes sweat from his eyes. \nTIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming as... \nTHE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before. She has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye-makeup and nails.  Ramones-style wardrobe.  She looks tense, and won't open the door very far. \nFIBERGLASS Yeah?  What? \nPAPPAS Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big. \nFIBERGLASS No. \nUTAH blinks at what he sees. \nHIS POV, in the little mirror. Like a silent pantomime under the ROAR OF THE MOWER, he sees Bunker and Warchild come flying into the room. They are hyper and manic.  Eyes wild. Bunker leaps clear over the bed. Grabs a COMBAT SHOTGUN from the closet.  Throws it to Warchild.  Tone is oblivious. Bunker thumps him in the chest and Tone leaps up like an overwound toy, gaping \"What the fuck?!\" we read his lips saying. Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO. \nUTAH (into his headset) Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there. They're pulling out a fucking arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole? Don't let him pull his badge! \nEXT.  BACK YARD \nCole and Munoz push their earpieces in deeper.  Scowl. \nMUNOZ Utah, say again.  What? (to Cole) I can't hear jack shit over this lawnmower.  Christ. \nINT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE \nIn the bedroom, Bunker looks through a slit of door at Fiberglass.  We hear Pappas just outside. \nPAPPAS (V.O.) ... and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard.  My wife'll kill me if I lose the little bastard.  Me, I could care less. Whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time... \nBunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive. \nBUNKER Something's goin' down, man.  This ain't right. \nTONE (freaked) No, man, it's nothin'.  It's nothin'. \nBUNKER Will you shut the fuck up!  Check the windows.  Do it!! \nEXT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE \nUtah sucks up against the wall as Warchild looks furtively out the window.  We see them both, but Warchild doesn't see Johnny, plastered right below him. Johnny closes his eyes and grits his teeth.  Shiiiiittt! \nPAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, is bobbing his head, trying to look inside. \nPAPPAS You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look? \nFIBERGLASS Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay-- \nPAPPAS Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him? \nFIBERGLASS There's nobody else here... \nINT.  HOUSE \nWarchild slams into the wall next to Bunker. \n", "test1_true": "TONE Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked, man. \nBUNKER That fat fuck comes through the door I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude up! \nScared and vicious, like a cornered dog.  We believe him. Bunker jacks the bolt on the Steyr.  Warchild cocks the shotgun. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nJOHNNY is pissing himself.  He can see it all going down. So fast he doesn't have time to think. He goes into motion -- slipping rapidly along the wall to the next window. The bathroom window. \nPAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, makes his move. He pushes the door open, breaking the security chain, and jams his FBI shield in the girl's face as he grabs her arm. \nPAPPAS FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a look around-- \nINT.  HOUSE \nBunker's eyes bug out as he sees Pappas coming through the door.  He snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder. Suddenly Johnny is behind him -- half-in the bathroom window, pistol gripped double-handed like they taught him in Quantico. \nUTAH FBI!!  DROP IT! \nBunker whips around.  Squeezing off a wild burst!  B-B-B- BLAM! It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder. Shatters the shower door behind him.  The BLACK-HAIRED GIRL screams. Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY.  Wild. Bunker drops, hit. Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge.  KABOOM! Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by Johnny's head. Deafening in the confined space. Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. Tone just splits.  Down the hall like a greyhound. \nPAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm. Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the bathroom doorway. He raises the Steyr.  Mistake. \nAngelo FIRES.  30 years in the field tends to show. Three rounds.  Chest.  Chest.  Head. Bunker is off the planet. \nMUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies. He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen.  Badass FBI agents. \nJOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot around the doorframe.  He gets a glimpse of Warchild's back disappearing into the hallway.  FIRES.  His shot is wasted, punching plaster. \nSuddenly a pink freight-train hits him. He forgot about the girl in the shower. Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first into the wall. As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH -- shattering the mirror. Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her. She drives her elbow into his back as he drops. \"FREIGHT TRAIN\" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.  It skitters under the bed. \nShe's cut up from flying glass.  Demon-eyed and wired, her body lithe and muscular under white skin.  She sprints across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for breath. \nIN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway. White-knuckling the forty-five.  A wild-eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it. He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins. It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun. \nWARCHILD Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck out of here! \nOff-guard, Tone is SLAMMED BY THE DOOR as Munoz drives into it with his shoulder. Pounded between the door and wall, Tone is wired so tight he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own right foot. He screams and drops to the floor. Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on Warchild, who dives into a doorway. Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor. \nCole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on Warchild. \"Freight-train\" appears behind him from another door. She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. Pulls them out, going for another stab, when-- Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the wall. \nUTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field of vision. On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.  Johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic.  His flying tackle catches Warchild at the window. \nEXT.  HOUSE \nThe window EXPLODES OUTWARD in a spray of sunlit glass. Utah and Warchild crash to the ground. The razorhead, with 50 pounds on Johnny, rises like a bull. Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows through the hedge. Johnny dives after him. The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him.  He is knocked flying, and the ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side. \nUtah and Warchild are locked together. The shotgun lies nearby, out of play. Warchild jerks a 6 INCH KNIFE free from its sheath, hanging from a thong around his neck.  He trusts straight at Johnny's throat. Johnny deflects the thrust -- INTO THE WHIRLING LAWNMOWER. KA-WHANGGG!!!  The knife is hammered out of Warchild's hand. Whistles away, spinning. \nWarchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade.  Utah catches the rim of the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from the rotor. Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny. Pushing him face-first toward the blades. Johnny feels the wind on his face. The engine is roaring, full throttle. \nPAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM. He aims the .38.  FIRES TWICE. The little Briggs & Stratton dies young, its casing shattered. The rotor spins to a stop. Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun. Two inched from his face. \nPAPPAS Speak into the microphone. \nThe razorhead sags, the fight going out of him. Babbit kicks him off Johnny, face down onto the lawn. Cuffs him. \nINT.  BATHROOM - BEDROOM - LATER \nUTAH dry heaves over the sink.  Turns the faucet on full blast and hoses his head.  He lifts a dripping face, wipes water out of his eyes, stops on the reflection in the mirror.  Pappas is there. \nPAPPAS It's always been lasers and paper targets until today, right? \nUtah looks up at him and nods.  He glances through the doorway at Bunker, dead in a pool of blood.  Tone is wailing as paramedics work on his foot.  Cole is being taken out on a stretcher. \nPAPPAS No difference, Utah.  Just a little more to clean up. (squeezes the rookie's  shoulder) It's alright.  You did good today. \nAcross the bedroom AGENT BABBIT rips the back off a big speaker unit.  Behind it, taped to the woofer, are two large packets of a white substance. \nPAPPAS Oh shit. \n", "test1_id": 918, "test2_input": "PAPPAS Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report. \nUTAH Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one. \nAngelo looks at the conviction in the other agent's eyes. Pappas sighs and puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder. \nPAPPAS Alright, look... banks are closed. Nothing's gonna go down tonight, right?  So we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow. Okay? \nUtah nods.  Then grins.  Pappas starts backing up, like a long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him back into the house. \nUTAH Woof, woof. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STREET NEAR BODHI'S HOUSE - DAY \nLONG LENS POV scanning Bodhi's house.  There is a \"FOR RENT\" sign out front.  The driveway and carpet are empty... no vehicles in sight. \nUTAH (V.O.) They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We missed them. \nUTAH LOWERS HIS BINOCULARS.  He's standing next to the car while Pappas sits on the hood, sipping coffee from a thermos. \nPAPPAS They're on their way to Maui. \nUTAH No way.  Not yet.  Come on. \nUtah jumps in and starts the car.  Pappas is screwing the cap on the thermos.  Johnny puts the car in gear, forcing Angelo to scramble in as the car starts to roll. \nPAPPAS Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't open 'till nine. \nEXT.  CITY STREET - TRAFFIC - DAY \nJohnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters. Long glittering lines and heat waves. \nUTAH I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me. \nPAPPAS Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard. \nUTAH I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in. \nPAPPAS Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  ASSURED TRUST SAVING AND LOAN \nSLOW PAN from the facade of the bank halfway up the block to Utah's sedan in the TIGHT F.G.  Head flopped back over the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page over his face.  Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth time.  Whole lot of nothing going on. \nAngelo slides the sports page down to his chin, without otherwise moving. \nPAPPAS Time for lunch. \nUTAH Angelo, it's eleven thirty. \nPAPPAS That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two. \nUtah slides out of the car.  Feeling a little exposed he pulls his Dodgers cap down a little tighter, and adjusts his sunglasses. He trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST- FOOD STAND nearby. Pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  FAST FOOD PLACE \nON A LONG LENS, very stacked up, we see Johnny standing at the grody pick-up window.  He keeps looking at the bank, visible B.G. The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out. Utah turns, pulling out his wallet. \nVOICE FROM INSIDE Two meatball, one tuna on wheat, two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty four. \nAs Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front of the bank.  The doors fly open. The Ex-Presidents jump out. They sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G. Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order. The Presidents disappear inside. Johnny looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement. \nREVERSE, as Utah walks back toward his car.  Pappas is still under the paper.  He slides it down when he smells food. \nUTAH Here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill.  Enjoy. \nUtah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into Pappas' lap.  Still standing next to the car. \n", "test2_true": "Pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag, unwrapping one end. \nPAPPAS (without looking) Damn, I could eat the ass out of an elephant.  I shoulda had you get me three a these.  What T-Bird? \nPappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls out of the end of the sandwich.  It lands on the seat next to him. He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it into his mouth and-- Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on... The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the doors of the bank 80 feet away. \nJohnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about two seconds.  Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes bugging. \nPAPPAS Jesus Christ!!  It's them! \nThe Presidents are piling into the car. Johnny reacts characteristically.  He whips out the Beretta and yells-- \nUTAH FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now! \nNIXON spins, raising his shotgun. But Reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand.  Shoves him into the car.  Then Reagan jumps behind the wheel. The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches. \nUtah FIRES. BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM! He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping a Subaru which locks them up and spins. \nPAPPAS Come on, kid, get in the car! Jesus! \nINT./ EXT.  SEDAN \nPappas reaches across, starting the engine as Johnny jumps in the driver's side.  Utah buries the throttle into the firewall and charges aggressively through the medium traffic. Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler, fishtailing.  It straightens out.  No T-Bird in sight. \nUTAH The hell are they?! \nPAPPAS They took a left at the next light! \nUTAH You sure?! \nUtah is totally wired.  Totally concentrated.  The adrenalin is kicking in, flashing through his system.  His brain is on turbo boost, reacting a thousand times a second as they hit sixty through the traffic, which seems to be standing still. \nUTAH I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it, I'm on it. \nHigh-speed slalom through cars and trucks. The world passes by in a hysterical blur. \nPAPPAS You even watching the road? \nA car pulls out, straight ahead. Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him.  The guy's bumper and front grille are removed.  Utah does a smoking skid-recovery.  Doesn't even slow down. \nThe late model T-Bird is weaving manically.  It makes a sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the FBI agents. \nUtah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot. Pedestrians scatter.  Utah center-punches a week's supply of groceries in a cart. \nINT./ EXT.  T-BIRD \nThe Presidents hold on desperately as Reagan white- knuckles it through civilian traffic.  They're looking all around, trying to see where Utah went. \nLBJ Where are they, man?  I don't see 'em.  We lose 'em? \nNot exactly... THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see an airborne Utah hurtling from a Ralph's entrance.  The sedan lands on the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the undercarriage. An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird. \nThe two cars spin out of control.  Utah cuts the wheel, slamming into them again.  Side by side demolition derby. WHAM!!  Utah hits them again.  The Presidents lose control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in the process. \nUtah's car starts to swap ends.  Hit the center island broadside. The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off. \nPAPPAS Nice fuckin' work, hotshot. Christ! \nThey can see the T-Bird still moving. It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on flapping rubber. \nJohnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back in broken glass.  Pappas is packed in, upside down, wriggling to get out through the side window.  A tight fit. \nINT./ EXT.  T-BIRD \nThe Presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing tire. \nREAGAN Emergency sanitization!  Here we go! \nEXT.  GAS STATION \nThe T-Bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a smoking stop at one of the pump islands.  The Presidents explode out of the car in a blur. \n", "test2_id": 919, "test3_input": "Reagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG. He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents charge past him.  Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the Mustang.  LBJ and JFK pile in. \nReagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER. Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the flame. Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle. \nLike an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant. Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated. Customers are running, screaming. Nixon has the Mustang fired up. \nNIXON Let's go!  Move it, Ronny! \nRonny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the scene with the jet of fire.  You can see it getting good to him.  In a second he's going to blow up the whole block.  But he's getting his rocks off.  He sets two other cars on fire. \nA FIGURE BLURS INTO FRAME. In a flying tackle, Utah catapults Reagan off his pins. They roll, skidding across the oily concrete. Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island. \nOut of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it. The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots blow out the back window. \nUtah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in half.  Drops to the cement. Reagan kicks him again and takes off running. The President is burning. His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he runs. \nGasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself out.  He comes up running, pulling his Beretta.  Sees the back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station. \nEXT.  ALLEY \nA non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one side, walled suburb on the other.  Two men running all out. A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter. \nBeyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES SKYWARD.  We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out in long blurring strides. \nREAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him, gaining. Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut mode. \nAHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley. Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges.  Utah whips through the gate a second later. Diving into suburbia. \nINT./ EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE \nIt becomes a blur.  Pure kinetic energy.  Two meteors rocketing through a low-rent suburb.  And God help anyone who gets in the way. \nReagan crosses a cluttered backyard. Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god- knows-what. He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of spray. Crashes through a hedge. Through the narrow gap between houses. Utah powers into the tight space behind him. Blurring along between stucco walls. \nThey emerge into the front yard. A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down. Reagan and Utah both hurdle her. \nAHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk. Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two. He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers. He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear. \nReagan flashes across the sunlit street. Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the brakes. It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back. The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the truck. Knocks him sprawling. Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back. Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of hyperkinetic video game. \nEverything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato impressions. The house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides. A MAN is picking up his mail. Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of the house. Utah follows. \nPanting as he sprints down a dark hallway. A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts past her, knocking her flying. Utah leaps over her sprawled legs. Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges. \nAcross the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on. \nREAGAN looks back. Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream. He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door. Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it. Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall. Heaves it ahead of him. \nThe glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS. Utah blasts through a microsecond later. Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery crashing everywhere. He sprints down a hallway after Reagan. A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun. \nWOMAN Get the fuck out of this house! What the fuck do you think you're doing-- \nAround a corner.  A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND. Utah sees something flying at him.  Reflexively catches it. Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL. The Fierce Woman's fierce dog. \nUTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face. He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a doorway and runs on. Another door.  Another explosion of sunlight.  Another yard. Sprinklers this time.  Reagan and Utah running through sunlit walls of rain.  They crash through another hedge. Emerging drenched. \nThe ground drops away.  Slipping and sliding on iceplant, they skid down a steep slope.  Reagan reaches bottom. A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to pavement below. Reagan falls, landing on his feet. Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on. \nUtah rips down through the iceplant like a human lawnmower. Slides over the edge.  Falls -- lands hard. \nTIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION. Taking the impact. We HEAR something go. Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with pain. He grabs his tortured knee with both hands. \nUTAH Not now.  Not now! \nReagan runs on.  They are in an enclosed storage yard of some kind.  Ten foot chainlink all around. Utah struggles to get up and run. He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain. We see the incredible will driving him on. He gets up and again, hobbling.  Trying to run. \nReagan reaches the fence. He is heaving for breath.  Holding his side. Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee. Hobbling forward.  His eyes wild, the veins in his neck bulging. \nReagan starts to climb.  Utah collapses to his knees.  He can't go on. Reagan reaches the top of the fence.  He looks back. \nUTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM. Twenty feet away.  The muzzle rock-steady.  He can't miss. They both are frozen, panting.  Locked into the moment. \nREAGAN You want me, there's only one way. \n", "test3_true": "ECU -- UTAH'S FINGER on the trigger.  Tightening. RACK TO his eyes.  Blinking, water running into them. God, he wants to. \nECU -- REAGAN'S EYES, through the mask.  Locked with Utah's. \nUTAH suddenly snaps his hand up and FIRES VERTICALLY. HE HOWLS WITH RAGE, FRUSTRATION AND PAIN. FIRES AGAIN.  And AGAIN. Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the concrete. Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY... Bulleting the blue sky. \nHIGH ANGLE, looking straight down on the tableau. Reagan leaps off the fence and runs OUT OF FRAME, as Utah empties the magazine straight at us, the shots merging with his agonized howl, echoing as we-- \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FBI BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT \nUTAH sits next to the DISPATCHER waiting for news like a sailor in a storm.  His leg is popped up on a chair with jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around his knee. His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises. He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen. \nPAPPAS comes through the doors, wiping the remains of dinner off his mouth. \nPAPPAS Nothing? \nUTAH Nothing. \nThe Dispatcher talks into his headset, glances up at Pappas, shakes his head. \nPAPPAS Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta here.  Get some sleep.  You look like shit.  They get anything even resembles your guy, I'm on your beeper.  Here.  You like feta? \nHe smiles warmly, handing his younger partner a brown paper sack. \nUTAH Feta.  My favorite. \nManaging a weary smile.  Lifts his body out of the chair, turns to go. Angelo ponders something. \nPAPPAS Johnny... \nUtah stops.  Looks back at the man. \nPAPPAS All I wanna know is one thing, why didn't you just take the shot? \nJohnny's gaze turns inward. \nUTAH I don't know. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BATHROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nUTAH sits on the bathroom floor as Tyler dabs Betadyne antiseptic over his wounds.  Utah cringes. \nUTAH Ouch. \nTYLER Betadyne doesn't hurt. \nUTAH You're kneeling on my hand. \nShe laughs, shifts her weight and keeps tending him. \nTYLER So what'd the other guy look like? \nUTAH Never saw him, was your basic hit and run. \nTYLER But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away? \nUtah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth won't quite form the words.  Tyler dabs his face, touches a finger to his forehead. \nTYLER Johnny, what is it with you?  You have that look again, it's like you're about to tell me something and then you don't... or you can't. What's going on? \nJohnny searches her eyes. She stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly. \nTYLER What?  What do you want to tell me? \nUtah's brow unfurls.  The thought has passed.  He slowly cups his hand over hers.  Gently pulling her close. \nUTAH I'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day... \n", "test3_id": 920}

JEFF we can braid them--three strips for each section. Then knot the sections together, for strength. Before either of them can respond, Stacy's voice emerges from the shaft, sounding SCARED: 
STACY (O.S.) I think he broke his back. They fall silent, staring down at her. STACY (O.S.) (cont'd) He can't move his legs. And it smells. 
JEFF Smells? 
STACY (O.S.) Like he lost his bowels. His bladder. 
AMY (very quietly) Oh no. Please no. Jeff turns to her. 
JEFF How can we make a backboard? Amy starts to shake her head, looking horrified. 
AMY No, Jeff. No way. We can't move him. 
JEFF One of the frames from the backpacks? And the tent poles. There's tape in the orange tent. He doesn't wait for a response; he leans over the shaft, 
SHOUTS: JEFF (cont'd) We have to builda backboard, Stacy. It might take a while. 
There's a long hesitation, as if Stacy is searching for some alternative. Then, still sounding FRIGHTENED and FARAWAY: 
STACY (O.S.) Okay. Amy is shaking her head, growing FRANTIC: 
AMY We'll make it worse. Well jostle him, and he'll-- Jeff turns toward her, with a hint of EXASPERATION: 
JEFF We can't just leave him down there. You know that, don't you? She starts to back away, toward the edge of the clearing. 
AMY we have to tell them. 
JEFF Who? 
AMY The Mayans. We have to tell them what's happened. Jeff gives her an incredulous look. She keeps retreating; she's almost at the path. AMY (cont'd) They can send for help. 
JEFF They're not gonna--- 
AMY We have to may. We have to-- She spins, starts off at a run, vanishing down the trail. Jeff calls after her, SHOUTING: 
JEFF Amy! But she's gone. Jeff turns to Eric. JEFF (cont'd) Stay here. 
And then he, too, is running. 
EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY 
The Mayans have established their campsite on the edge of the jungle. Two women are beside a campfire, plucking a pair of chickens. WE SEE other campsites in the distance, other campfires, hugging the jungle's margin, surrounding the hill. Three men sit in the center of the clearing, facing the hillside, their bows in their laps. They rise suddenly, peering up the trail. The women pause in their labor, also staring. The campsite goes QUIET. 
THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL Amy is sprinting toward us down the trail. Jeff is ten yards behind her, also running. 
BACK TO SCENE The three Mayans nock arrows. Two other men step forward to join them. One has a bow; the other is the bald Mayan, with the pistol. He unholsters it, and--as Amy reaches the bottom of the trail--raises it, aiming at her chest. Amy stops just short of the clearing: sweating, breathless, scared-looking. She lifts her hands, palms-up, beseeching. 
AMY Help us. Please. Someone's been hurt. He-- Jeff comes to a halt, five feet behind her. 
JEFF They can't understand you. She turns, her voice quickened with PANIC: 
AMY Say it in Spanish. Tell them he-- 
JEFF They don't speak Spanish.

BOY W-I-L-L-I-E. 
HELMUT Fine.  I'll just write that on top of your head. 
Using the eraser end of the pencil, Helmut carefully traces the letters on top of the boy's head.  The youngster peers upward, wondering. 
HELMUT There.  See, this way we'll all be able to tell everybody else's name just by looking at his head. 
CLOSE SHOT - BOY 
still looking up, but now doubtful. 
BOY Did you really? 
MED. SHOT - THE GROUP 
HELMUT Of course I did.  Here... 
He pulls an older boy to his feet, winks at him and points to the first boy's head. 
HELMUT (to the older boy) Tell him what it says. 
OLDER BOY (giggling) It says Willie. 
BOY (impressed) Really?  Truly? 
He puts his hand to his head. 
HELMUT Be careful.  Don't smear it. (he glances around) Let's see now... Yes.  You shall be next. 
He points to a Czech girl of about six.  He motions for her to come over to him.  She shyly bows her head.  Her friends push her forward. Helmut holds out his hand to her, she grabs it. 
HELMUT What is your name? 
She looks at him, then at the other Czech children.  They all giggle. 
HELMUT (squatting down beside her) Forgive me.  I don't speak your language. 
He gently plants a kiss on her cheek and she puts an arm around his neck. 
HELMUT (to others) See!  We understand each other. Now... (he points to Willie) Willie. (he points to himself) Doork. (points again to Willie) Willie. (pointing to himself) Doork. 
The child's eyes light up and she whispers into Helmut's ear. 
HELMUT A beautiful name!  Now you tell all the children. 
CZECH GIRL (almost a whisper) Inga. 
HELMUT It's such a pretty name... say it again. 
CZECH GIRL (more sure of herself) Inga! 
She quickly bows her head for Helmut to outline her name on the top of it. 
HELMUT (with a flourish of his pencil) I-N-G-A.  There it is. 
The little girl gives a quick curtsy and hurries back to her group.  Helmut glances around at the children. 
HELMUT Let's see now.  Who wants to be next. 
The little girl with the doll presses forward. 
HELMUT You? 
Shaking her head she holds up the doll. 
HELMUT Her? 
LITTLE GIRL So the little children will know her name. 
HELMUT Of course.  That way she can't get lost, can she?  What's her name? 
LITTLE GIRL Frederika. 
HELMUT (mock dismay) Frederika? 
He studies the top of doll's tiny head.  Then he holds up his hand and measures off a distance of about three inches in the air with thumb and forefinger. 
HELMUT Frederika! 
Next he puts the doll's head between his thumb and forefinger, illustrating that the head is too small for the name. 
HELMUT Couldn't we just make it Freda? 
LITTLE GIRL (solemnly) Oh, no!  Frederika. 
Helmut shrugs, closes one eye and begins writing in tiny letters on the doll's head.  The children laugh delightedly. 
EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - FULL SHOT - DAY 
Sergeant Hoffmann is walking his post beside the open door of the boxcar.  Inside we can see Helmut and the children and HEAR their laughter. 
The CAMERA PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff sits in the front seat smoking a cigarette and waiting.

He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.

In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.

Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door. 
95   IN - MR 
ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead- ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is his last shell. 
ASHLY 
(To himself) More shells. Where did I see that box of shells?

From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun. He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.

The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back- wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully, ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for something to happen. He is tense and more determined than ever to survive. He whispers to himself. 
ASHLY 
C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this? 
Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's necklace. 
ASHLY 
...Linda. (He whispers) 
The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion. CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and fires at her head.

Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL is jolted from the door. 
99   IN - M.R. 
ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands. Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several steps, then continues after ASHLY.

He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS. 
She watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him. 
The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but he is gone. 
EXT. PLAZA 
Rath races wildly across the darkening market square. 
INT. BURNED HOTEL 
Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS. 
BAIN Die, bitch! 
He FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the floor around her feet. 
Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall. 
His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as -- 
She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall. 
Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until -- 
Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed. 
She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is PERFORATED with BULLETS. 
BAIN Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you doing?  I don't believe this is happening! 
She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go. 
BAIN You're dead!  You're fucking dead! I'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this! 
Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves he'll know her position. 
He FIRES another. 
Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. 
Another SHOT. 
She FIRES back. 
Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS, flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets. 
Her gun empties first. 
He laughs hearing the CLICK. 
BAIN Game over, bitch! 
RATH Bain! 
Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building. 
Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream- like grid resembling a chess board. 
Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. 
The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she races back to the room. 
BAIN Fuck no! 
Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty. 
RATH Shit! 
Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to the end of the hall. 
Rath sees it all happening. 
RATH Electra! 
Bain snaps into a targeting stance. 
Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly touching the floor -- 
TELESCOPIC SIGHT 
When the cross-hairs find her back. 
BACK TO SCENE 
RATH Electra! 
Time becomes syrup. 
RATH Down!  Get down! 
Bain FIRES. 
Electra dives. 
The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her. 
She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room. 
Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the stairs.

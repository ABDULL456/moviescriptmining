EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVE. DAY (LATER). 
Eating and drying in the powerful afternoon sun. A little self consciousness has returned but it's sweet-natured and fun still..... 
MEGAN I really can't eat all this chocolate by myself... Never mind, yes I can! 
KRISTI So have you got a girlfriend, Aron? 
ARON Well, there's not really anyone special. 
MEGAN Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends. 
KRISTI There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet. 
MEGAN Yeah, we meet lots of guys and there's always a girl. 
ARON Long story. 
KRISTI With lots of characters in it.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINTOP. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
Aron on top of a snowy peak. Self shot. Classic pose. Breathtaking backdrop. 
ARON (V.O.) I've done 46 of the 59 winter solo ascents. 
MEGAN Wow, highest person in Colorado. 
ARON Well I figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter. 
KRISTI ... you can be the highest person on the continent!

EXT. STILL CAMERA. IMAGE OF `MOTEL 6' 
Megan shows the image to Aron. 
MEGAN Didn't you see it? 
ARON What? No. 
MEGAN Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's house - the roof's caved in and someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on the side. Smelled weird though. 
ARON Just like a MOTEL 6 then?

WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything. 
Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod. 
SVEN Oh shit. 
From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights. 
Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his lunch. 
SVEN Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out. 
BRODSKI (over radio) Dead? 
SVEN Oh yeah. 
Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend. KICKER (into radio) Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got it to. Real slice and dice. What should we do? 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro. 
BRODSKI Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt. 
KICKER IN THE GRID 
KICKER Roger that. (to himself) Time to kick some ass! 
From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the darkness. 
KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready! 
IT'S SVEN! 
SVEN Sorry! 
KICKER Don't friggen do that! 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Brodski is in assault mode. 
BRODSKI Yllo, what's your head count? 
YLLO Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa. 
JANESSA You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that? 
Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment. 
BRODSKI This place should be safe. Get them back here. I don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. As much as I've dreamed of doing that. 
Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin. 
BRODSKI I need to know what you know about this guy. 
RIZZO Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it. 
BRODSKI Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. 
Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy. 
BRODSKI I've been a grunt for fifteen years. There's not a problem I can't fix with enough ammunition. 
Yllo is getting no response. 
YLLO Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately! (beat) I'm going to see if I can find them. 
Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp. 
Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over to her with a blanket. 
KKINSA Sstoney's dead! 
They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo puts her head in her hands...not again. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall. 
YLLO ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends. 
BRODSKI Not a chance. 
YLLO JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. 
BRODSKI You got that right. 
They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM. 
YLLO This thing could be worth a great deal.... scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with you 50/50... 
The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind. 
BRODSKI You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!! 
KICKER Fuckin A... 
BRODSKI Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do! 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to do. 
YLLO That bastard! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors. 
Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

DUKE I can't hear you. 
PRESIDENT YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE! 
DUKE (to Brain) Get me the diagram. 
BRAIN Duke... Don't kill Plissken.  We need him. 
The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance. 
DUKE Get moving, Brain. 
Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the President's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down and kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then puts it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had. 
Which is not saying much. 
EXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON Helicopters fly above ground.  A group stands with a car, gesturing wildly. 
INT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON 
PILOT People out below in the park.  Can you see them? 
INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON 
PILOT Surveillance 2 to Security Control.  We're getting that readout, mostly in the infrared. 
Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor.  At least something's going on. 
PILOT We have a visual sighting on it.  It's a crowd of prisoners in Central Park.  They're waving at us.  Signaling us in the food drop area. They're waving us down. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON The prisoners wave the helicopters down.  A group of guards lands and runs over to the station wagon.  They get the briefcase which has been sawed off the President's handcuffs. 
INT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON Snake is awake and surrounded by guards.  The cheers are louder. 
INT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun.  It's one of Snake's. 
BRAIN I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was telling the truth or not.  God, I hate that guy. 
Brain stands in front of his maps.

Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too intense. 
23   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                23 
Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and voice). 
CHARLIE Are you trying to have some sex? 
Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She climbs on top of him and -- 
-- they start having sloppy, drunk sex. 
After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving. She looks down to discover that -- 
-- he's passed out. 
Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her unconscious husband. 
24   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                24 
Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there isn't more alcohol in the house. 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Kate puts on her slippers, robe and -- 
25   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          25 
Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her robe and slippers). 
26   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT                               26 
Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf. 
Kate sets the bottles on the counter.                             * 
The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate with pity. 
CLERK You know I can't sell you this, Kate. 
An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at Kate.                                                             * 
KATE What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me. 
CLERK Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late. 
The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45). 
KATE C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two... 
Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch. 
CLERK (not amused) Stop it. 
KATE It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything. 
CLERK I don't think so. Sorry. 
Kate gives him a big, flirty smile. 
KATE Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want. 
Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance. 
CLERK It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that. 
KATE Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends. 
CLERK I could lose my job. 
Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.                   * 
KATE (to the elderly man; meant to be a whisper, but way too loud) You distract him, okay?! 
The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of it.

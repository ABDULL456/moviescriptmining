JODY And the police did nothing? 
MARGE EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. 
JODY How could you? 
MARGE I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town. 
JODY The word is Mob. 
MARGE I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd. 
JODY Who were they? 
Marge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that. 
MARGE Who? 
JODY The men. Do any of them still live around here? 
MARGE Two men left town right after it happened. 
JODY You're not telling me something. 
Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say. 
MARGE Mr. Sisler was one of them. 
JODY (shocked) The principal? 
MARGE Yes. 
JODY Who was the fourth? 
Marge is stricken. She looks down. 
MARGE God. It's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground. 
Jody gets it. 
JODY Dad? 
Her mother can't deny it any longer. 
JODY(CONT'D) (horrified) THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them. 
MARGE Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have... 
JODY NO! 
Jody gets up. MARGE He dedicated his life to law enforcement after... 
Jody runs off, very upset. 
EXT.  LIBRARY 
Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off. 
EXT.  GARDEN 
Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed. 
EXT.  INDIANA DIRT ROAD 
The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman' Brent's police car turns into the driveway. 
INT.  CAR 
Brent pulls up to the house. he sits and stares for a moment. 
EXT.  LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE 
It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign stands crookedly in the front yard. 
Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty tools and old auto parts. 
EXT.  FRONT DOOR 
Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks. 
No one answers. 
He knocks again. 
No one answers, again. 
A WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house.

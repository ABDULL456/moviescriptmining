CUT TO: 
179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179 
Fran has just arrived. She scans the place. Doesn't see Mackelway. Great. She reaches for that cel-phone again... 
CUT TO: 
180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180 
Mackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED. 
And he is staring into his own REFLECTION. 
He lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor, just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look at but himself. 
He strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them. He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to watch it all with perfect clarity. 
A few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet. 
O'RYAN Are you afraid? 
There was a delight to that question - we can see it on O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the gag. But the answer's obvious. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) (quoting himself, as Daitz:) "Imagine a killer with no patterns, no tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of evil." 
All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) And the name we give that killer... is Zero. (again:) Are you afraid? 
Slowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on the floor. It GLOWS. Good God... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) It'd be customary at this point to start praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't seen too many answers though. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either. You're alone. 
Mackelway tries to speak. It's impossible. 
O'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for Mackelway to say: 
MACKELWAY Where's the boy? 
O'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily. 
O'RYAN (re: the mirror) My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic. I'm almost envious. (MORE) 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) (casually) The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are you afraid? 
Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it... 
O'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) I know what you're thinking: "There is pain coming. Am I going to take it like a man?" Let me put you at ease: You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It's pathetic. Are you afraid? (of course, no reply) Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated. They're just mine. And they're helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender... well, it's almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don't want you to miss it. Are you afraid? 
With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful. 
But Mackelway can't look at anything else. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) How about now? 
Just like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke rise from its edge. 
And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it. 
He struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound comes out of him. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you afraid? 
O'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes... 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you? 
Two things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry... 
O'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) Are you? 
Mackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is awful. He stares at his own reflection. 
...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) (top of his lungs) Are you afraid?! 
That bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight - can't watch this anymore. 
O'RYAN (CONT'D) (infuriated) Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit or I'll cut the fucking lids off!! 
Mackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep sobs shudder through him, as... 
O'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm: O'RYAN (CONT'D) ARE YOU AFRAID?!?! 
Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag. 
With his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS, obliterating the image. 
...and everything goes black. 
Then, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them back: 
180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a 
Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of the Navaho.

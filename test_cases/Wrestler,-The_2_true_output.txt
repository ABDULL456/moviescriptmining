WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Trust me, babe. You're gonna be happy. 
Randy, hearing this, slows. 
DUDE #1 (O.S.) We said the other one. 
DUDE #2 (O.S.) The redhead. With the belly chain. 
Randy peeks through the curtain. Inside, he sees CASSIDY (36), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white spandex dress. With her are six hair-gelled, goombah-wannabe BACHELOR- PARTY DUDES (early 20s). The BACHELOR is sitting in a chair in the middle. 
CASSIDY Sorry, guys, she's on break. 
DUDE #1 Well, I'm sorry, but we don't want you. 
DUDE #3 How old are you, anyway? 
BACHELOR You're, like, my mom's age. 
Stifled laughter from his buddies. 
OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN: 
Randy's anger builds as he watches. 
VIP ROOM: 
Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, straddles the bachelor. 
CASSIDY There's nothing like experience. (into his ear, seductive) I've done things your little fiancee's never dreamed of... 
DUDE #2 Yeah, like graduate in 1985. 
This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN. 
RANDY (to Dude #2) Apologize to this lady. 
Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy. 
DUDE #3 Who the hell are you? 
RANDY You speak to her with respect. 
Cassidy wedges herself between Randy and Dude #2. 
CASSIDY I got this. It's okay. 
RANDY No, it's not okay. This is definitely not okay. 
He turns to the bachelor. 
RANDY (CONT'D) I guarantee this woman's 50 times hotter than whatever goombah skank you're about to marry. 
DUDE #4 (to Dude #1) You hear what he just called Gina?! 
DUDE #1 That's my fuckin' sister! 
Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified. 
Randy makes like he's going to hit the guy with the chair. Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL. 
DUDE #2                         DUDE #1 Jesus!!                         What the FUCK!! 
The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like that, they're GONE. 
Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead he gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE. 
CASSIDY Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks just walked out. 
Randy is totally taken aback. 
RANDY I was just trying to help. 
CASSIDY Did I ask for help? (BEAT) Did I need help? 
Randy looks down, silent and sheepish. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Then don't fuckin' help. 
RANDY You're right. I'm sorry. (BEAT) I'm sorry. 
Cassidy calms down a little. 
CASSIDY That's okay. 
She looks at him with a warm smile. 
CASSIDY (CONT'D) Good to see ya, man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER 
MUSIC: KHIA - "MY NECK, MY BACK" 
Randy is getting a LAPDANCE from Cassidy. She plants her hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just inches from his face.

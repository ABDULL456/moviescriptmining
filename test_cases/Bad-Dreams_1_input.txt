CYNTHIA Yes. (to Miriam) See you later. And...     thanks. 
MIRIAM Thank you. 
Miriam then gets into the elevator.         The doors remain open, Alan turns to Cynthia. 
ALAN How are you feeling? 
CYNTHIA Fine. 
ALAN Good. 
He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him. She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person. 
Miriam smiles and waves. 
Cynthia smiles and waves. 
From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and waves. 
The elevator doors close. 
CYNTHIA No! 
Alan whirls around.       Cynthia rushes to the elevator. 
CYNTHIA (CONT'D) Miriam!    Stop! 
She bangs on the buttons. She pounds on the doors.          Everyone in the corridor turns to look. 
ALAN Cynthia? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
He starts to approach.   She runs to a stairwell. 
93   INT. STAIRWELL                                                      93 Cynthia sprints down a flight.    She goes out onto 
94   INT. HALLWAY, ONE FLIGHT DOWN                                       94 Cynthia runs to the elevator and pounds on the button, but the elevator car has already passed. 
CYNTHIA (yelling into the door) Miriam, get out! 
She races back to 
95   INT. STAIRWELL                                                      95 She flies down the steps.    We can hear ALAN tailing her. 
ALAN'S VOICE Cynthia! 
She swings around a turn into a flight and trips.     Suddenly she's ROLLING DOWN A 
96   EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT                                               96 She SLAMS into a tree.   We see the Unity House in the distance. 
VOICE Cynthia! 
ANOTHER VOICE She's trying to get away! 
There are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her. She gets up and runs along the path into the forest. 
VOICE Cynthia! We want you to stay with us! You mustn't be afraid! 
She is in total panic, running blindly. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Please, no. 
Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black as night. 
The people are getting nearer. 
FEMALE VOICE She's over here. 
We see someone nearing through the brush. 
HARRIS No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand. 
Cynthia looks down the cliff. 
ORDERLY'S VOICE Take my hand.

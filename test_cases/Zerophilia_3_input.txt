Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off. 
INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN 
Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with Jeremy. 
JEREMY This shirt? I've had it for years. 
SYDNEY Well, it's very sexy. I love men's clothes. What else have you got in your closet? 
Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches, her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside. 
JEREMY Polly, are you alright?   Didn't mean to walk in on you. 
POLLY Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love, tears. That's the trade-off. 
She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks behind the bar. 
SYDNEY My God, he's gorgeous. 
POLLY Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the sweetest boy in the world. Sorry, darling, I'm afraid you'll find he's not your type. 
SYDNEY Oh, we'll see about that. 
POLLY I think he may prefer men. 
SYDNEY I certainly hope so. 
Keenan and Janine enter. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) You two better have a seat. 
JANINE Is Luke alright? 
SYDNEY He should have full control over this now. Something must be really confusing him. The only thing I can think of... 
KEENAN What? 
SYDNEY When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine? 
JANINE No.   Not me. 
KEENAN Well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me. 
JANINE No.   Definitely not. 
SYDNEY Wasn't it just the two of you? 
JANINE Not exactly. 
Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out. 
KEENAN Oh, give me a break! No way! Max?! They just had a huge fight. He tried to beat the crap out of him! 
Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look. 
KEENAN (CONT'D) Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!   He was just turnin' into a girl! 
JANINE Exactly.   He was a girl. 
KEENAN Oh!   This is just wrong. 
JANINE Would you rather she was attracted to me? 
KEENAN Would you?! 
JANINE Maybe I would! 
SYDNEY Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke needs your help. He needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants. 
Janine nods. 
JANINE So, what's all this mean?

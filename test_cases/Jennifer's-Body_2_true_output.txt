INT. KITCHEN - (BACK TO REALITY) Needy WAKES UP in a cold sweat, gasping. She's still on the kitchen floor. She peels herself up off the floor, disoriented. 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - CONTINUOUS Needy trudges into her dark bedroom. She strips off her clothes and stumbles into bed. JENNIFER'S VOICE What's up, Monistat? 
Needy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified. Jennifer is curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually. She's freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky T- shirts. Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of bed, pulling the covers with her. JENNIFER God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche. NEEDY Get out! JENNIFER But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties. She winks conspiratorially at Needy. 
NEEDY What the fuck is happening? JENNIFER Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'? 
NEEDY I saw you! I saw you! The car...the...I... JENNIFER (MIMICKING) Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped. NEEDY I'm calling the police. JENNIFER Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEEDY What do you want? JENNIFER I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Remember the night of the fire? NEEDY Yeah, it rings a bell. JENNIFER Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van. 
INT. SOFT SHOULDER'S VAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT 
Jennifer is crouched in the back of the van. None of the band members are speaking. Nikolai Wolf drives down a gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the woods. 
JENNIFER Guys? Where are we going? 
NIKOLAI Shut your mouth, object. 
DIRK (NERVOUSLY) Nikolai... 
Jennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed. There's glow-in- the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls: goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. She sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "Spells and Incantations," "Summoning the Beast," and a copy of the Black Mass. 
Jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the side door. MICK, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking her down. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Are you guys rapists?! 
NIKOLAI You wish. 
Jennifer struggles again, but Mick holds her down.

{"train": "NEW YORK MINUTE by Emily Fox \nrevisions by \nMark Steilen \nREVISED SECOND DRAFT \nFebruary 27, 2003 \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING Quinn hops in her Saab. ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in. \nINT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed, checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and prays. QUINN (to phone) Doctor MacLeod... (beat; winking at Drew) I'm sorry, but my itinerary is booked solid today. Call Dr. Wessels. He's covering for me. (beat) He did? (beat) Are you sure it's the baby's head? (beat) All right. I'm coming. Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound disappointment, turns to Drew. QUINN I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light special in Maternity. Every bed's full and some poor woman is about to give birth in the gift shop. I have to go in. Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom. DREW Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame. It's like fate is conspiring against us. QUINN I know. DREW You absolutely, positively have to promise me we'll do it another time. QUINN I promise. I better hurry. Have Parker drop you at the train station on her way to school, will you? Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: QUINN Kill 'em in that interview. DREW (beat) Mom, you know, I might not get in. QUINN Are you kidding me? You're Drew MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody works harder and nobody, and I mean nobody, is ever more prepared. Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street. With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, \"thank you.\" This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street. DREW Hey!   Stop! Drew takes off running after the car! DREW PARKER!! \nEXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNING Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station. \nINT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNING Parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew collects her bag. PARKER Good luck with your interview. Drew pauses, holding the door open. DREW You know, Parker. Chemistry is important. When you think about it, everything's made of chemicals. (CONTINUED) \nEXT. TRENTON STATION PLATFORM - MORNING Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on the train into the FIRST CAR. PARKER (calling after) I guess you were never young and randy! This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window, smiling and giving her a little victory wave. \nINT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take when he sees Drew. CONDUCTOR Very funny. DREW Excuse me? CONDUCTOR Let's go. He takes her by the arm. DREW What are you doing? Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little inflatable lap desk falling to the floor. CONDUCTOR I tried to be nice about it, but if you want the police involved, this is the way to do it. DREW Police?     I didn't do anything. CONDUCTOR No ticket, no train ride. DREW (realizing) No! That's not me! That was my twin sister you threw off! CONDUCTOR Young lady, in thirty years I have heard every possible line but that's the lamest ever. DREW (pointing) She's right there! \nANGLE ON THE PLATFORM No Parker. He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR, SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS, OUCH! (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY? BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles: DREAM GUY You okay? DREW I'm... ouch. CONDUCTOR She's fine, considering she should be in jail. As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and Dream Guy share a last look before she's... ... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out. Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her wits about her. DREW This   can't be happening! I have a...   a... little paper thingy. What   are they called? Ticket! I have   a ticket! It's right... She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket in the mess. The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as it pulls away. He just waves, victorious. Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other -- oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs inside    and the train is gone. DREW (to the gods) AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR! Parker steps up from behind her. PARKER You get kicked off, too? Why didn't you just buy a ticket? Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DREW Don't. PARKER What happened to your head? DREW Oh, just a minor concussion I sustained while the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought I was you sneaking back on the train! PARKER Sorry. DREW I'll bet. Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a doozey. PARKER (calling after) I am!    Where are you going? DREW To see when the next train leaves. PARKER I already -- But Drew's inside the stationhouse. PARKER -- did. They said something about a delay. Parker follows into the stationhouse. \nCONTINUED: BENNIE So you're headed to the Teamster's Hall on Second Street? PARKER (chewing a lip) You know, Mister... She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin Loyola. PARKER ... Loyola. BENNIE Bennie. PARKER Mr. Bennie? We have a slight change of itinerary. We need to go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th will be fine. Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit. BENNIE It's pre-paid.     No skin off my nose. DREW (whispering throughout) Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th? PARKER (whispering throughout) Barneys. DREW Not Barneys. PARKER We've got five hours.     Relax. He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go. Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS. DREW This was supposed to be someone else's car, wasn't it? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER So? Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can read: DREW 'Scarpelli'?   We're supposed to be Italian? PARKER Northern Italian. DREW This is so... wrong. PARKER What? You need to get to that interview. We now have a ride. We will pay for the ride. End of big deal. This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it. BENNIE Yeah? (beat) No.  The city. (beat) What'a you talkin' about? Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the girls... BENNIE I already got 'em. ... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets worse. BENNIE They're right here in the car. (to girls) 'Scuse me. Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation. The girls are PETRIFIED. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER (low to Drew) Not good. DREW (swallowing) What's happening? BENNIE (to phone) Don't you think that's a little severe? I mean, they didn't see nothin' yet. They can't hear nothin'. YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell. BENNIE You're the boss. (beat) Take it easy. I'll fix it. (beat) No, I don't have a shovel. Not today. It'll be a big mess. Besides, I just had this suit cleaned. The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR! BENNIE I'll take 'em to the wharf, what difference does it make? Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it. DREW (whispered terror) Parker, I think maybe we should get out. Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED. PARKER I agree.   How about... NOW! Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her door open and pulls Drew into the street! An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for the sidewalk. BENNIE (O.S.) Hey?!   Where you goin'?! \nEXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race around the first corner, looking back over their shoulder. PARKER He's stuck at the light! VRROOOM!   Here comes the Lincoln storming around the corner. DREW He has no respect for traffic laws! They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back out, the same way they came. SCREECH!   Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS! They round the same corner going the opposite way and Parker pulls them into the first door... \nINT. MINI-MART - MORNING ... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: \"EMPEROR DEFENDS CROWN.\" Parker peers over the top and out the window. PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street, Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them. DREW Is he gone? I can't believe this. What did you get us into? PARKER We lost him.    Wow. That was a rush. DREW A rush?   Are you out of your mind? BUM (O.S.) Hey.   Give me a quarter, will ya? Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches in her pocket. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER So? You've got the emergency credit card Mom gave you, right? Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS. PARKER What's wrong? DREW (dawning realization) Oh.   My. God. PARKER Where's your, uh, stuff? DREW (near coma) I left it in his car. PARKER Oh. DREW He knows where I live. He's going to hunt me down and kill me. PARKER Come on, Drew. I don't think even the Mafia kills people just for scamming a ride. Quit being paranoid. (beat) So, we don't do the Plaza. I've got... Parker digs in her pockets. PARKER Six dollars and thirty-two cents. DREW That won't get me hosed down at a car wash. PARKER What are we thinking? You've got your secret-safety twenty! DREW (beat) My secret-safety twenty. Of course. But it's only for emergencies. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Parker looks her sister right in the eye. DREW Yeah. Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls out a twenty, then realizes: DREW Hey, how'd you know about my secret-safety twenty? PARKER That's not important now. But let's just say that it's a good thing for you I think those shoes are so ugly I never borrowed them. (pointing) Hey, how about there? Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads: THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS. DREW No. I want to get clean, not contract hepatitis. PARKER (sotto voce) Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents. DREW We touch nothing. Parker leads them inside. \nINT. THE RITZY PLAZA This looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dime's worth of crack. There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the \"desk\" which is       behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead houseplant. An        old easy chair leaks stuffing. PARKER (swallowing) Hello?    Anybody? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something BREAKS.        Then a DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKS to them. DESK CLERK (O.S.) Keep your pants on. What'dya want? The girls look behind them, nobody.       Behind the bars? Still nobody. What the hell? DESK CLERK (O.S.) I don't got all day. PARKER (uh...) We need a room... with a shower. Just for an hour. There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know what he was doing behind the counter. DESK CLERK Sixty bucks. PARKER (getting oriented) Hi. DESK CLERK You want the room or not? DREW Sixty dollars an hour for this -- PARKER (interrupting; covering) -- really nice place. How much for half an hour. DESK CLERK Maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty. PARKER We've only got twenty-five. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DESK CLERK You think because I'm short you can just charm me into making some deal, is that it? PARKER No, not at all. DREW It's all we have. Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents. DESK CLERK Are you the one that stinks so bad? DREW (insulted) I had a little accident, okay? DESK CLERK All right, all right, don't    get your underwear in a bunch.     As a public service, just 'cause    you stink so bad, you can have    it for twenty-five. He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach between the bars. DESK CLERK Ten-dollar deposit on key. DREW What part of 'That is all the money we have' didn't make sense to you? PARKER Sir,   that's every last cent we have   in the world. I swear to you,   we aren't planning to steal your   key. DESK CLERK I give you some special deal, the next thing you know, you two are telling everybody, hey, this midget was a real sap. We gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes. PARKER Quiet.   Don't run. He'll see us. Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off quickly down the street. ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel. DREW HE SAW US! The girls break into a run. DREW How'd he find us? PARKER Maybe it's just coincidence! DREW Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE GOING!! She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   Oops. PARKER Come on! Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, Parker spots a fresh pile of... ... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew, however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her eyes. PARKER Jump! Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT, we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it. Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass. This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors. \nINT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb it's clear: He's lost the girls. \nDREW AND PARKER DREW I don't want to do this anymore. I want to be done. No more rats, no more mob hit men. PARKER Well, Cinderella, your wish has come true. (gesturing) Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle. DREW So?     Hello?   No dinero? PARKER Yeah. I've got what I'd like to call a 'creative solution' to that. DREW No.     I'm calling Mom. PARKER What good will that do? DREW (beat) I'll have her... uh... PARKER Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city? DREW Dad, then. PARKER Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser. Couldn't get to an interview by myself, need full bail out. Yeah. I'm the one who was going to change the world, I just couldn't get across town. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DREW Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is shot to hell! Blue, red -- Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS. DREW I don't even know what that means! I'm running out of time. (noticing) Is that guy looking at me? Parker starts to look. DREW Don't look. PARKER When you ask a question like that, the person is going to look. Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY (MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on them. DREW I think he was. PARKER Drew, we haven't done anything. DREW Yeah, but I'm standing in the lobby of the Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment. In fact, I might attack at any moment. The ELEVATOR behind them opens. PARKER Let's go. The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes, Morty's watching. \nINT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA - DAY The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the corner. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master bedroom and slowly OPENS them. There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply eyes them. He might even be smiling. DREW Oh, no.  Oh my god. A... a... (puzzled) What the hell is it? PARKER A dog? DREW I'm itching already.   See?   Are my arms red? Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door. PARKER Key down. I'll take him in the living room and keep a lookout. You just get in that shower. Parker approaches The Emperor. PARKER (baby talk) Hi, little guy. You don't look so tough, huh? You don't look much like a dog, actually. More like Woody Woodpecker. Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps into Parker's arms. PARKER You're cute, aren't you, in a freakazoidal kinda way. She takes him into the living room and moves to the door. PARKER Was your daddy a rat? Is that it? Well, I still like you. Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to keep a lookout. \nPARKER'S POV The hallway's empty. But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's play! \nBACK TO SCENE PARKER Come back here, little ratdog. Come to Mommy Parker. Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to spook him into running away from her, she steps into the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and dashes down the hallway. PARKER Bad ratdog! She chases him down the hallway     and then around the corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder, until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is COVERED. Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his arms. PARKER (breathless) Wow.   Thank you. ROGER Thank you. Bye bye. No. He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after him: PARKER That's not your dog!      Hey! \nANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty) steps out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry... ... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos' suite. CUT TO: \nCONTINUED: ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns around and lopes back to the suite. MORTY Mrs. Lo Biancho? I'm Mort Sestero, hotel security. MRS. LO BIANCHO Please!   Please help! MORTY Someone took your baby? MR. LO BIANCHO The Emperor is missing. MORTY (somewhat relieved) The Emperor is a dog, right? MRS. LO BIANCHO Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION AND WHY AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FIND HIM! Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads down the hall. MORTY (to radio) This is Remote One to base, Remote One to base. Code 12, I repeat, Code 12. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) You goin' to lunch already, Morty? MORTY (impatient) Code 12 isn't lunch, Bruce! Didn't you read your manual? ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) (beat) I will. MONTY Call NYPD.    We have a dognapping. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) A what? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MORTY Just call the damn police and patch me through. The Emperor's been kidnapped. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) Holy cripes, why didn't you say it was political?! MORTY Political?     THE EMPEROR IS A DOG, MORON! ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) You want me to call NYPD about a dog? MORTY (decrying his fate) I am going to kill you, then fire you, Bruce. Got it? Kill, fire. That order. CUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE PLAZA - DAY Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape. DREW I can't do it! PARKER Yes you can! \nANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and sides: \"Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every time\". DREW No I can't! PARKER Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer Internships' on your college application, you can write 'license plate manufacturing.' (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention. She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears around the corner into traffic. Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster. DREW (astonished) I did it. Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK -- nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE ALLEY at Parker's feet. DREW (O.S.) OW! PARKER Get out of there! DREW (O.S.) (beat) Give me... my... curtain. Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They hurry off down the alley. IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears. MORTY Stop!    Bring back that dog! MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A small dog could easily be concealed under that shower curtain. ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker. DREW He thinks we have the dog! PARKER A painter took it! DREW A pain -- WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands RIGHT ON TOP OF       HER. (CONTINUED) \nINT. RUNWAY - DAY FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk. ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS. This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV MONITOR at the end of the walk. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE HAS DECIDED -- IT'S A SMASH! THEY APPLAUD MADLY! BRAVO! BRAVO! Drew recovers herself a bit.        Wow.   They're clapping for me? \nINT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN) through the back door. Uh-oh. The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker takes the initiative and... \nINT. RUNWAY ... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she was born to it. Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and... ... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy executive! and leans into her sister: PARKER (whispering) The hotel guy's here. The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR! BRAVA! Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing kisses and heading for the girls. PARKER (louder) And the police. Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off the front of the stage into the audience like punks jumping into the mosh pit. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF toward the rear of the room. DREW Everybody washed their hands, right? \nINT. CHARLEY'S '77 FORD PICKUP - DAY Charley's driving,      eating a sandwich and dialing his CELL PHONE at the same      time, veering dangerously and obliviously across      the center stripe. The oncoming CAR careens out of his      way in a blaze of HORN. CHARLEY (to phone) Hello, beautiful Doctor Lady. How goes your day? (beat; huh?) Right next to the magazine rack? What did they name it, Newsweek? (beat) I'm going into the City to meet some big shot publisher. Maybe I'll swing by NYU afterwards and see if I can give Drew a ride home. You talk to her today? (beat) She's probably having too much fun to call. I'll ring her up. Bye bye. He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way. CUT TO: \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LO BIANCHOS' PRIVATE BOX Far below, Garden employees set      up for the dog show. Inside, the Lo Bianchos' luxury      box is likewise being prepared. In one corner, Bruce       and Morty are fumbling with the unfamiliar electronic      tracing gear, readying for the ransom call. Mrs. Lo Biancho turns up her nose at the buffet table. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MRS. LO BIANCHO (to Caterer) What are those? CATERER Rumaki, ma'am. MRS. LO BIANCHO Rumaki! Yech! You might as well wrap dog turds in bacon. Take them away. A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to trade air kisses. BABS Andrea, Andrea. How dreadful!      I shudder to think how the poor Emperor may be suffering. MRS. LO BIANCHO Dear Babs.     I'm at wit's end. When she turns on Morty and Bruce, they both jump a little. MRS. LO BIANCHO (putting on a show) You! Tell the thieves I'll pay anything they want! Anything! BABS Of course.     What price on a loved one? MRS. LO BIANCHO Precisely! BABS I've got to    run. That stupid groomer used    a commercial conditioner    on Coco and she looks like trailer    trash. Babs nabs one of the rumaki on her way out. As soon as Babs is gone, Mrs. Lo Biancho looms over Morty and Bruce. MRS. LO BIANCHO I'll give them ten grand, tops, but only if the dog's back before show time. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: A troubled Bruce isn't having much luck operating the trace machine. BRUCE (aside to Morty; whispered) Do you know how to turn this on? CUT TO: \nEXT. SIDEWALK IN NEW YORK - DAY The girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking cross-town in couture, Drew with only one shoe and in a bad mood. PARKER We're going to make it, Drew. You'll see. There's still plenty of time. You'll get cleaned up, we can trade clothes... this is a nice suit, huh? Right? DREW (abrupt) Yes. PARKER You're going to get accepted, then we can explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything will be okay. DREW Maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking into someone else's hotel room, we can ask them to please keep the mob hit man from whacking us and dropping us into the marina so he doesn't get his suit dirty. PARKER First things first. DREW Parker, I know you're trying to cheer me up, but I have to be honest. This is all your fault. (CONTINUED) \nEXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY The Horse Carriage passes the usual groups of PROTESTORS and TOURISTS outside on the U.N. Plaza and... ... the Girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed for the ENTRANCE where there's a LINE at the door. DOWN THE BLOCK the Detectives' unmarked car appears and parks at the curb. Williamson and Hogan climb out, scanning the crowd. WILLIAMSON (pointing) There they are. \nDETECTIVES' POV -- just a glimpse as they ENTER the building. \nBACK TO SCENE HOGAN What in the world could they be doing here? \nINT. ENTRANCE TO U.N. - CONTINUOUS ACTION The Girls pass through the metal detector and move toward a small group of TOURISTS waiting by the sign that reads: NEXT TOUR 11:00. DREW (re: Warren) Do you see him? Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then scans the group. PARKER No. At the head of the group, the U.N. TOUR GUARD, geeky in a Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not a male model, leans into a petite BRUNETTE and her LITTLE SISTER. TOUR GUIDE (conspiratorially) I can't tell you how much I've looked forward to this. The Brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer. BRUNETTE (in Russian) Momma? Her fierce-looking BABUSHKA MOM gets in the Tour Guide's face. TOUR GUIDE Sorry.   My mistake. This is when Drew notices Williamson and Hogan ENTERING and approaching a U.N. SECURITY GUIDE, flashing their badges. DREW Oh, shit.   What now? PARKER (out loud) Warren? Does anyone know Warren Collier? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks over at them. WARREN Parker? Warren moves back to Drew and Parker. PARKER Gee, Warren. Isn't that strange? I didn't recognize you from your picture. WARREN Yeah, I, uh... DREW (urgently) We don't have time for this now. PARKER Do you have an office or someplace private we could go? WARREN I just have to do this tour and... But Williamson and Hogan, led by the U.N. Security Guy, ENTER the lobby. Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him. DREW We'll get back to that. WARREN What's going on? Parker looks Warren right in the eye.     This is a test. PARKER It's important. WARREN (beat) Okay. Let me get somebody to cover for me. Warren leads them into a small adjoining office... \nINT. U.N. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY The three make their way across the vast lobby, but before they reach the main hall... HOGAN (O.S.) (spotting them) Hey!   You two! Stop! WARREN This way! Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS, Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right. Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn, another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth. Even while running frantically, she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S room and quickly ditches inside. \nINT. U.N. - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath. GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her. Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN can't be ignored. DREW (to person in stall) Are you okay? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE (near fatally nauseous) Ohhh... I'm so sick. The mussels at lunch. You have to help me. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DREW I'm kind of in my own private hell right now. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE What's your name? DREW Drew. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Drew... it's vitally important. A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Please.    You have to take this to Canada. DREW Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE (struggling) In the Assembly. Give the file to Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian representative. (GROANNN!!) Please. I can't... get up. DREW You want me to take this to the Canadian Representative to the United Nations? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Hurry!    This is a crisis! What can she possibly do? DREW (confused but...) Okay. Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door. DREW Where's the Assembly? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE To the left.    Run! Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes. CUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAILROOM On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the corner. \nINT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies. An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty ASSEMBLY ROOM. Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up. WARREN He's gone. Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's an awkward moment of attraction between them. WARREN (no better idea) You have nice breath. PARKER Thank you. (beat) Maybe we should get out of this sack. CUT TO: \nINT. U.N. - MAILROOM Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway. PARKER How are we going to find Drew? WARREN Something tells me that won't be too tough. Warren points to the MONITOR. Parker's jaw drops.         Her sister is addressing the entire U.N. Assembly. CUT TO: \nINT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY Drew glances Williamson EXITING. DREW And besides, who said absurd is necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd is good! For instance, absurd can be sort of... funny! In conclusion, I propose that all of you should talk amongst yourselves. (quickly) Thank you. Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- KOFI ANAN BANGS his gavel. KOFI ANAN Canada has proposed further debate. U.S. REP The United States of America seconds the motion! \nINT. LOBBY OF THE U.N. ASSEMBLY - CONTINUOUS ACTION Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker come running with the Detectives chasing them. The three of them make for the front door but a TOUR GROUP comprised of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks their EXIT. Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE. WARREN Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT! SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour outside, Warren and the Girls following. \nEXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN. WARREN Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai! The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT. The three of them run for the line of taxis. PARKER You speak Japanese? WARREN I may not look like an underwear model, but I'm smarter than a hundred of them put together. Warren grabs a Taxi door. WARREN Come on! PARKER We don't have any money! WARREN I'm smart AND rich! Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through the little Japanese Girls. Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just ahead of... Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar- chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab up ahead. \nINT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle. Parker leans urgently into the DRIVER: PARKER Follow that... uh... DREW They're following US, Parker! PARKER Oh, yeah.   JUST GO! The TAXI pulls away from the curb. \nEXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle. DREW Darn it!   DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT! This is when she sees, parked just down the block... ROGER'S VAN with \"Michelangelo's Painting\" across the back door. DREW That's... that's the painter. Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep out of sight and watch the van. A BLOCK BEHIND THE TAXI -- \nINT. DETECTIVE'S CAR - SAME TIME Williamson and Hogan have the same problem with the traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead. WILLIAMSON Did one of them just get out? HOGAN I think so.   Maybe she's going for the dog. WILLIAMSON Maybe that's what they want us to think. HOGAN So we stay with the taxi? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: WILLIAMSON Unless you want to hoof it after the other one. HOGAN We stay with the taxi. \nINT. ROGER'S VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION Roger dials a cell phone while The Emperor stands on the passenger seat with his front paws on the dash. As far as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped and doesn't mind being mauve. ROGER Get in the back, will ya? The Emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of New York go by. ROGER Stupid dog. But his CALL has gone through.        He imitates a GIRL'S VOICE. ROGER (as GIRL) Hello? CUT TO: \nINT. LO BIANCHOS' BOX (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) - CONTINUOUS ACTION Mrs. Lo Biancho calmly answers her cell phone. MRS. LO BIANCHO Yes?

I want a hundred thousand dollars transferred into this numbered Swiss account -- (CONTINUED) \nEXT. LOADING DOCK (MADISON SQUARE GARDEN) - CONTINUOUS ACTION CHAOS. The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,    sporting nifty sweaters and manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block the door. In addition     to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get inside, they're holding    off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho, Williamson and Hogan. SHOW OFFICIAL #1 (quite disturbed) No entry without official credentials! MR. LO BIANCHO I'm Emile Lo Biancho! I demand to be let in! WILLIAMSON NYPD!   Move aside! At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off. SHOW OFFICIAL #1 (chin set) I'll have to see identification, officers. (to Mr. Lo Biancho) I'm so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go right in. AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not wanting to be seen by the Detectives. WARREN You think she made it? PARKER She's faster than she looks. CUT TO: \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION She is -- but now she's not running to catch a policeman, but to try to keep from being over-taken by... ... A GIANT PACK OF PEDIGREED POOCHES WHO CHASE DREW ACROSS THE SHOW FLOOR. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - LO BIANCHOS' BOX The ROAR of the CROWD and the BARKING of the PACK draw the attention of everyone in the Lo Bianchos' box. MORTY Isn't that The Emperor, ma'am? MRS. LO BIANCHO Good God.   He's mauve. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN Drew makes it across the floor and out the other side into a tunnel... \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONCESSION AREA ... appearing in the concession area. \nDOWN THE STREET Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back window. WARREN What now? PARKER We have to go to the jail and tell them what happened. WARREN What on earth did happen? PARKER Poor Drew. She wanted to get into that program more than anything in the world. With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker. BENNIE You goin' somewhere? She's paralyzed with fear. WARREN (gulp) Hello, sir. PARKER Oh my God!   Please don't kill me! WARREN Kill? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER We don't know anything at all! We didn't see anything or hear anything and I'll swear to that in a court of law! Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying to meet death with dignity. PARKER Just not in the face. BENNIE What's the big idea? You two a couple a nutbags or somethin'? She opens one eye. PARKER Nut bags? No. I mean,    yes. Is there a right answer to  that? See, my sister had this  interview which turned out not to  be an interview, really and I  sort of messed things up because  I wanted to meet him. Indicating Warren. WARREN Really?   You came into town just for me?   Wow. PARKER Not now, Warren. (back to Bennie) Drew was going to be late even though technically she wasn't going to be late since there wasn't an interview and that's when we got in your car. I promise we meant to pay. It was a true emergency. BENNIE I meant, why you runnin' when I'm trying to give you your bag back? Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.      Parker takes it, still trying to comprehend. PARKER You were just...? (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BENNIE I found your mom's number in the book. She said you needed it pretty badly for that big interview. Listen, I gotta go. It's my mother-in-law's birthday and I gotta plant some stupid rose bush and then take her out to dinner at the Pier. See ya around. Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in. PARKER (beat; calling after) Thank you? WARREN Well, he certainly is a good Samaritan. Parker looks at the daybag. WARREN You guys lead a pretty interesting life, don't you? But now Parker's mind is elsewhere.     She pulls out Drew's daybook, opens it. WARREN We going to the jail, or what? I've never been to a jail before. PARKER What time is it? CUT TO: \nINT. JAIL BOOKING ROOM - DAY FLASH! A MUGS HOT is taken of Drew, looking as bedraggled, beaten and defeated as humanly possible. CUT TO: \nDREW staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan finishes fingerprinting her other hand. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: HOGAN There's your alibi. DREW I don't even know him. HOGAN That's what he said. Go home. Get cleaned up, a good night's sleep. None of this will seem so bad in the morning. Hogan leaves them alone.       Bike Guy steps over. BIKE GUY You okay? As an answer, Drew merely points to herself -- look at me? Now answer for yourself. BIKE GUY I'm Jim Wessler. DREW Thanks, Jim.    How'd you know? JIM (BIKE GUY) Who could forget that face? Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face. DREW Huh.    No hives. Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew becomes self-conscious. DREW Well... bye. She walks past him out the door. JIM Wait.    Where are you going? EXT. NYPD STATION HOUSE - DAY Jim catches up to her. DREW Thanks for getting me out of jail but I have to go home now because my entire life is ruined. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JIM Bad day, huh? DREW You turn understatement into an art. JIM Can you just tell me your name? Please? DREW (sigh) I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who won't be going to the NYU Accelerated Program. JIM Why not? Drew looks at her watch. DREW Because short of flying, there's no way to get from here to NYU in five minutes. JIM Sure there is. CUT TO: \nEXT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes but forgot to show up for the semester. Warren's looking over her shoulder. WARREN Wow.   And I thought I was anal. PARKER This is no good. I don't do too well with the whole rehearsal thing. I'm more of a 'wing it' person. Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass. Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER (all business) How's this look? Drewish? WARREN You know, I've always had a thing for librarians. PARKER Warren, honesty is fine. But you could edit a little, you know? WARREN Got it. PARKER Wish me luck. WARREN Good luck, Drew. CUT TO: \nINT. NYU ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - CLOSE ON A HAND about to knock on a door that reads \"Professor Que Spaulding, PhD\" when the door suddenly opens and the last INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and tie, confidence oozing.

MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly) which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW WAGGING. From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD, 17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the shrieking ALARM CLOCK. With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20 T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff. Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit concerned down at her navel. A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the source. She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers: THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M. Parker snickers, types her return from... NOTATWIN:   CONFESS THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER. NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.

MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer... ... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath where it says, \"tweezers.\" She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow. Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too psychotic. She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces them. Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth. PARKER (O.S.) Morning. Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off the water pick, dries her face. PARKER Why the young executive look? DREW I have my interview at NYU today. Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new belly ring. DREW No way Mom knows about that. Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt down. PARKER And she never will. At least until after I'm married. DREW Didn't it hurt? PARKER Like hell. Drew shivers. DREW Piercings are so... unhygienic. A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DREW Breakfast. Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of... ... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post- apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the    Koreas. Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her Blackberry: THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS? NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL? THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT. NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET. THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO. Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein model-type. PARKER (suddenly wide-awake) Hellooo, Warren. Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet. ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking. Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then... nah. Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth, brushes with a finger and spits. \nINT.

You should try one some time. QUINN (to Drew) You ready for your interview? DREW (funny you should ask) I've prepared a color-coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red, double- checked the train schedule, confirmed with the Weather Channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just to account for all the possible glitches. PARKER We'll take that as a yes. CHARLEY I'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years, sweety. PARKER I still don't understand why you want to finish college in two years? What's the big hurry? DREW I want to hit the ground running. All those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene. It just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively. QUINN The Accelerated program would look great on your med school application. PARKER Football games I get. But partying? A waste of time? Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CHARLEY To each her own. QUINN Well, Drew.   I have a surprise. Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT. QUINN I took the day off. (excitedly) I'm going into the City with you. DREW (panicked) What -- ?! Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose. QUINN Isn't that great! We can do some shopping, have lunch, real girl stuff. Won't that be fun? PARKER If you want to have fun, I'm the one who should go, not Mother Teresa over there. Drew is still choking -- pretty badly. PARKER Let me know if you want me to do the Heimlich. It'd be cool to have you owe me your life. WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air. QUINN You okay? DREW (still clearing) No... I mean, it's... impossible. I've got every minute accounted for right up to the interview. Blue and red! It won't work. QUINN I just thought... you know... I've been working and we haven't had a chance to spend much time together... (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up. QUINN ... and both my babies are going away to college next Fall. She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder. PARKER Don't be sad, Mom. Just think, when Drew leaves for school, you won't be losing a daughter, you'll be losing an anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin. Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder. DREW I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet of you. But don't worry. Parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her. QUINN Stop it, you two. Mom blows her nose. PARKER It's not fair you guys get to go into the City and I don't. CHARLEY Don't you have a chem test, young lady? PARKER Chemistry? Please. Name one time you ever used chemistry in your life. CHARLEY (beat) Good point. QUINN (adamant) I use chemistry every day. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER You're a    doctor, Mom. I'm not going to    be a doctor. I can't even say    the word 'orifice,' let alone put    a finger up one. The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go. Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the news that her mother's going to accompany her. DREW (worried) Time to go. \nINT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite.

QUINN (O.S.) Come on, honey! Let's tear up Manhattan! With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself and tries some self-reassurance. DREW You're smart. You're resourceful. You'll find a way to make it work. She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.

THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION The police and security look left, right, across the street. BRUCE Where'd they go? HOGAN They couldn't have gone very far. We'll split up. (pointing) You go that way! You take Fifth! Come on, get on your horse! Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner moves. WILLIAMSON Coffee? HOGAN Sure. Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up next to a NEWSPAPER STAND. WILLIAMSON (to hot dog vendor) Two black. HOGAN Where do you think those two went? WILLIAMSON Beats me. They didn't have any stupid dog with them from what I could see. HOGAN Might have stashed it. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: WILLIAMSON Maybe they ate it. The cops giggle at this. WILLIAMSON The rent-a-cop said the mutt's worth like 50 G's. That makes it grand theft, my friend. Five to ten. \nANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two policemen. HOGAN (to blind cashier) Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a couple of blondes run past here, did you? SPEEDY Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real criminal types. Looked like they were headed to Mexico. HOGAN That's where they all go. \nANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter right next to Speedy. WILLIAMSON See you around. SPEEDY Not if I see you first. The cops head back to The Plaza. HOGAN I say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch. I don't want to be stuck in the same room all day with Leona Helmsley's nasty stepsister.

THOREAU 786:     HOW'D CHEM TEST GO? PARKER (beat; epiphany) Oh my God. Warren works in the city. DREW Warren? WARREN?! So you lied, right to my face. No, Drew, this isn't about the chat room guy. Nah! But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on -- she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a newspaper peers down at the strange sight. SPEEDY (to guy) Take your daughters to work day. The guy pays for his paper, leaves. NOTATWIN: WARREN. MY REAL NAME'S PARKER MACLEOD.         MY SISTER AND I NEED A FAVOR.

PARKER (to Drew) The United Nations? DREW You can't possibly know somebody who works at the United Nations. Maybe he meant United Sub Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats Store. NOTATWIN:     UNITED NATIONS? THOREAU 786:     JUST A DAY JOB.    JOIN THE 11:00 TOUR. SOON. Parker pockets the Blackberry. PARKER So. We're going to the United Nations to use the restroom. DREW How convenient. You arrange a little date while your sister's future hangs in the balance. PARKER Look, he said he'd help and it's only a couple blocks away. You got a better idea? Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: SPEEDY (how's he know?) Coast's clear. PARKER Thank you, Mr. Speedy. SPEEDY You're quite welcome.    Good luck in that interview.

MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe, Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his laptop. The SCREENSAVER, an animated version of         Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing \"All        work and no play...\" When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his chair. He hunts it down through the MAELSTROM on his desk. CHARLEY (to phone) Wal-Mart? (beat) Hey, Marvin. You bet.    Typing away. He glances at the screensaver, the same words pouring out. CHARLEY (suddenly concerned) Today? (beat) Gee, I'm on a real roll, Marv. The juices overfloweth, if you get my meaning. Don't want to plug the juices when they're overflowing, right? (whoa) How much? (beat) Hm. I guess I could carve out some time. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Charley smells his armpit.       Ripe.   He'll need a quick shower. CHARLEY Got it.   See you in the City.

Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn, another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth. Even while running frantically, she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S room and quickly ditches inside. \nINT. U.N. - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath. GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her. Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN can't be ignored. DREW (to person in stall) Are you okay? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE (near fatally nauseous) Ohhh... I'm so sick. The mussels at lunch. You have to help me. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DREW I'm kind of in my own private hell right now. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE What's your name? DREW Drew. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Drew... it's vitally important. A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Please.    You have to take this to Canada. DREW Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away. CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE (struggling) In the Assembly. Give the file to Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian representative. (GROANNN!!) Please. I can't... get up. DREW You want me to take this to the Canadian Representative to the United Nations? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE Hurry!    This is a crisis! What can she possibly do? DREW (confused but...) Okay. Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door. DREW Where's the Assembly? CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE To the left.    Run! Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes. CUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAILROOM On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the corner. \nINT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies. An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty ASSEMBLY ROOM. Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up. WARREN He's gone. Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's an awkward moment of attraction between them. WARREN (no better idea) You have nice breath. PARKER Thank you.

DREW Oh, no. You didn't have the mussels at lunch, too, did you? Even as she holds out the file, he races past her, puckering his bum. She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THE DOORWAY. Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files around. Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one on. \nANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE Williamson's gaze comes to rest on... ... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD.         Hm.   That looks familiar. This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points an accusatory finger at Drew! CHINESE REP This crisis falls at the feet of one nation and one nation only! CANADA! ALL EYES TURN TO DREW. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: CHINESE REP How do you defend such a position! The world is waiting to hear! These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT. Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet. She gulps air. Glances left, right.

DREW (recovering) ... that I NEED to defend our position! Ah, yes, some knowing nods.

NORWAY Weird hairdo. \nBACK ON DREW CHINESE REP That is absurd! DREW Absurd?! Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for emphasis.

JIM (BIKE GUY) Who could forget that face? Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face. DREW Huh.    No hives. Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew becomes self-conscious. DREW Well... bye. She walks past him out the door. JIM Wait.    Where are you going? EXT. NYPD STATION HOUSE - DAY Jim catches up to her. DREW Thanks for getting me out of jail but I have to go home now because my entire life is ruined. (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: JIM Bad day, huh? DREW You turn understatement into an art. JIM Can you just tell me your name? Please? DREW (sigh) I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who won't be going to the NYU Accelerated Program. JIM Why not? Drew looks at her watch.

Warren's looking over her shoulder. WARREN Wow.   And I thought I was anal. PARKER This is no good. I don't do too well with the whole rehearsal thing. I'm more of a 'wing it' person. Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass. Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.

PROFESSOR SPAULDING I'm sorry, but I have a plane to catch. He tries to make a move.      Parker blocks him. PARKER I know. But this is very important. PROFESSOR SPAULDING What is this about?

She scrambles out of the shrub... DREW Fine. ... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns. DREW Wait right there. (beat) I mean, I don't want to be bossy. You don't have to stay right there, if you don't want to. JIM I'll be right here. DREW Great. She launches herself into the building. \nINT. PROFESSOR SPAULDING'S OFFICE - DAY Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap. PARKER (primly) I promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized. This was, and I think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PARKER (CONT'D) I was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard to the dance that I simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, I over-looked it until after the deadline had passed. PROFESSOR SPAULDING Ms. MacLeod, I recall your application being one of the strongest we received. Not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me. I assumed, of course, that you'd changed your mind. PARKER No. Not at all. This program is my number one priority. PROFESSOR SPAULDING Yes, well, I'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process. A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN: DREW Professor Spaulding? I can't apologize enough for barging in like this. The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look. PROFESSOR SPAULDING No. Please. It looks like I'm taking the red-eye now anyway.

An Olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the Tokyo view. Bob is handed a swim cap and goggles. 
Bob watches a Japanese BUSINESSMAN swimming, he looks like an over-grown baby. 
Bob swims laps in the pristine pool. 
He continues his laps. Under water he sees the jumping legs of MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. 
A disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a WESTERN INSTRUCTOR in tight shorts leading an aqua-aerobics class to the group of WOMEN, They jump up and down to Sister Sledge.

INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY 
Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious scholar man's voice speaks clearly : 
DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul beginning with an imprint.... 
Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a turtleneck and glasses.

INT. HOTEL - DAY 
Charlotte follows a JAPANESE FAMILY in formal dress out of the elevator onto the mezzanine level. She wanders down a big hall. 
She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions enthusiastically. 
KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my own stunts! 
The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer. 
Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER. 
SWEATY JOURNALIST What was it like working with Keanu Reeves? 
KELLY It was great. I've known him for a while now- you know we both live in L.A. We both have dogs... 
Charlotte walks out. 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door and peeks in.

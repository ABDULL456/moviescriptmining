The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise. 
Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into some furniture and dives for the door. 
INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape. Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong as he is, but he has the edge in experience. 
Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway, ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went. 
SYKES (struggling with Cassandra) Fire escape!  End of the hall! 
Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and charges down the corridor. 
EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT 
Jetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees Watson reach the ground and take off running for the parking area. 
Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase. 
EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting down other rows trying to make up the distance between them. 
EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT 
Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen feet to the ground. 
EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls his gun, aims. 
The white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there, gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to avoid being hit. 
INT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT 
Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas. Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car. Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass, panics and-- 
EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars. 
Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car. 
Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees. 
SYKES (breathing hard) I'll be damned.  It worked. (sees Jetson run up) How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo! Both barrels.  Dropped him like a bag of cement. 
Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the I.D. 
SYKES Who is he? 
JETSON Todd Watson.  The assistant manager. 
Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one agonized breath. 
WATSON I don't believe this.  Look at my suit.  Look at what you made me do to my car. 
SYKES (laughing) Your girlfriend put up a better fight than you did, pal. 
JETSON We are looking for your employer, Joshua Strader. 
WATSON He's out of town. 
JETSON Why did you run? 
WATSON Because you two were chasing me. 
SYKES We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch. 
JETSON When will Strader return?

She affectionately touches Daisy's cheek. 
THE NURSE (CONT'D) She seems like a sweet woman. 
Caroline nods. 
CAROLINE I haven't spent as much time as I would have like with her the last few years. 
Another NURSE looks in... 
THE WOMAN You busy? 
The Nurse quickly   goes out of the room. Caroline sits back down looking   at her mother...Daisy opens her eyes... they look at each   other... Caroline knowing Daisy wants to hear the sound   of her voice... 
CAROLINE (taking up the book) The next page says... 
Daisy shuts her eyes...

BENJAMIN (V.O.) ...Queenie would let me go with Mr. Daws to Bridge City..To watch the boats go up and down the river... 
71   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY, 1932                       71 
The busy docks... Men waiting, hoping to find work... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) These were hard times... people were doing anything they could to find work... 
And we see Benjamin, with Mr. Daws, "the lightning man," sitting on a bench with a line of other old men, "killing time," watching the boats going up and down the River... 
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I was struck by lightning seven times? Once, when I was in a field tending to my cows. 
And we see just that, Mr. Daws, along with a cow of his, being hit by lightning. 
A MAN'S (V.O.) (shouts) My fourt' hand didn't show up... Anybody want to make $2 for a day's work around here... 
Benjamin turns... And he sees a man in his late 40s with his three man crew, standing on the deck of a TUGBOAT, and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron... The man, its Captain MIKE... Has a thick Irish accent... For some reason none of the able-bodied men needing work respond... 
CAPT. MIKE What's wrong, nobody wants to get their hands dirty...! Nobody wants to do an honest days work for an honest day's pay...! 
A MAN (warning them) He never pays... He always says he'll have to owe it to you...

CAPT. MIKE Are all you afraid of workin' for a livin'? Somebody got to want a job... 
Benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity, waving his arms... 
BENJAMIN I do...! 
CAPT. MIKE You got your sea legs old man? 
BENJAMIN (feeling his legs) I do. I think. 
CAPT. MIKE That's good enough for me! Get your ass on board, we'll sure as hell find out! 
And as Benjamin gets on the boat, heading out to sea... 
72   EXT. TUGBOAT, MISSISSIPPI RIVER, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1932       72 
And we see Benjamin "learning the ropes..." Helping to tow the freighters, into and out of the River ports... Benjamin in this element, like a boy, his hair blowing, thrilled to be on the boat, thrilled by the adventure... willing to do anything... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I was as happy as I could be... I would do anything... 
CAPT. MIKE I needs a volunteah. 
BENJAMIN Yes, Captain! 
CAPT. MIKE (motioning) Scrape off this bird shit. 
BENJAMIN Right away, sir...! 
And he hops to it... Happily scraping off the bird shit... Happy to be doing anything...

73   INT. TUGBOAT WHEELHOUSE - END OF ANOTHER DAY, 1932              73 
Mike's a hard drinker, God's last angry man... He's drinking as they go in for the night... Benjamin sitting with him in the wheelhouse... Capt. Mike jawing away... 
CAPT. MIKE ... What were you born to do, old timer? 
BENJAMIN I haven't found out yet. 
CAPT. MIKE You haven't found out yet?! How old are you, Benjamin, seventy somethin' or other? 
BENJAMIN Not as old as I look.

The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to: 
EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY) 
For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan climbs out of shot. 
WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY) 
revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead. 
Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on the soundtrack. 
Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter. 
It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan. Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his climb. 
A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY) 
near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion. 
ETHAN Whoaa.. 
He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang. 
REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT 
with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To lizard: 
ETHAN You're welcome. 
The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back. 
Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm. 
The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses. 
ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES 
First, a retinal scan. 
ELECTRONIC VOICE Identity confirmed. 
SWANBECK Good morning, Mr. Hunt. 
Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.  Over his introduction of Nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot. 
SWANBECK'S VOICE Your mission, should you choose to accept it, requires you to recover a stolen item, designated Chimera.  Essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.  She is a highly capable professional thief currently active in Spain. 
A series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints, Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville. 
SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd) Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.  You have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall and meet me in Seville to receive further details.  Should you or any member of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. 
Swanbeck's face reappears on screen: 
SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd) And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on vacation, please be good enough to let us know where you're going.  This message will self-destruct in five seconds. 
Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space. 
ETHAN If I let you know where I'm going - 
The glasses explode in a puff of smoke. 
ETHAN (cont'd) - won't be on holiday. 
Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE) 
Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, exits her car and enters the villa. 
A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE) 
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them. 
REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN 
looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another.  Ethan approaches her.

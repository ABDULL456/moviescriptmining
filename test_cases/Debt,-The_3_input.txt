She watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit. 
Suddenly it brakes... 
IN THE VAN 
Stephan throws the gear into reverse.. 
ON RACHEL 
and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards Rachel. 
The Guards at the side-gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors. 
The side door is flung open and Rachel dives in, just as Stephan roars forward again.

P.O.V - THROUGH WINDSCREEN 
The Guard from the bridge has run down the stairs and is now between us and the exit. As we watch he raises his rifle... 
STEPHAN Down! 
The three duck as the Guard fires, punching a neat hole in the windscreen. Seconds later the van thuds into him, sending him flying. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   54.

129     EXT. ROAD NEAR STATION - NIGHT                               129 
STEPHAN'S P.O.V 
On the road ahead a Border Guard Jeep appears, driving directly towards them. 
Stephan has no choice - he floors it. 
At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall.

Stephan fights to keep the van under control, screeches into a turn and off down the road. 
STEPHAN Is he dead? (Beat) Is he dead? 
RACHEL Who? 
STEPHAN The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? RACHEL No. 
Stephen's grim silence says everything. He glances back at the unconscious Vogel lying between the other two. 
STEPHAN How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection? 
Rachel hesitates. 
STEPHAN Did you give him the... 
RACHEL I don't know! I thought I... FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   55. 
STEPHAN Jesus Christ! 
Stephan can't believe it's all fallen apart so quickly. 
STEPHAN We could have gone! 
DAVID It's not over. 
STEPHEN We could have fucking...! 
DAVID WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him. 
Stephan glares at David but doesn't say anything. The van roars on. 
131    INT. SAFE HOUSE. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                            131 
Rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room, staring at something. 
RACHEL'S P.O.V 
...three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room. We hear the three distinct notes of the water drops. 
Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb. A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and David walk in, hair soaked from the rain. 
RACHEL (Standing up) What did he say? 
Stephan stalks past, ignoring her. 
RACHEL You made contact? 
David nods. David looks after Stephan who's walked on into the living room in grim silence.

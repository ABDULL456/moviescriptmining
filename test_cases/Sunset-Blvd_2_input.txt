BETTY Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher. 
GILLIS What teacher? 
BETTY Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it. 
GILLIS You did? 
BETTY He thinks it could be made into something. 
GILLIS Into what? A lampshade? 
BETTY Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck. 
ARTIE Unless you'd rather have Sarah Bernhardt. 
BETTY This is on the level.  Sheldrake really went for it. 
GILLIS O.K.  Where's the cash? 
BETTY Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work. 
GILLIS I was afraid of that. 
BETTY I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man. 
ARTIE Could you write in plenty of back- ground action, so they'll need an extra assistant director? 
BETTY Shut up, Artie. (To Gillis) Now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story. 
GILLIS Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec. 
BETTY I tell you this is half sold. 
GILLIS As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether. 
Max has appeared in the door. 
MAX Mr. Gillis, if you please. 
GILLIS Right with you. 
Max leaves. 
ARTIE The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links. 
GILLIS I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career. 
BETTY It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write. 
GILLIS Sorry if I crossed you up. 
BETTY You sure have. 
GILLIS So long. 
He leaves. 
ARTIE (Patting her hand) Babe, it's like that producer says: In life, you've got to take the bitter with the sour. 
D-6     THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE 
Gillis comes from Schwab's, gets into the car. 
Max takes off. 
NORMA What on earth, darling? It took you hours. 
GILLIS I ran into some people I knew.

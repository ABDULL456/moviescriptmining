BUNCE I'm cussing loving this! 
BOGGIS Who's hyper-cussing-active now? Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant shovels clank against each other, ripping through the tree's roots. 
INSERT: A temperature gauge with its needle pushing the limits of the red. 
CUT TO: A grizzled, white-haired man in a greasy yellow and black jumpsuit and coke-bottle protective eyeglasses. A patch on his pocket says E. Malloy. He watches the farmers digging crazily with the tractors. Sparks from the mayhem reflect dancing on his lenses. 
EARL MALLOY These machines weren't made to be handled like this. 
DISSOLVE TO: The hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree. The tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors. 
DISSOLVE TO: The hill now razed with the fallen, old beech tree laying on its side as the tractors dig deeper. 
DISSOLVE TO: The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater. A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers. A television reporter with an Action 13 camera crew confronts 
BEAN: 
REPORTER Farmer, correct me if I'm misreading the data, you've successfully destroyed the scenery, but the alleged fox remains at large. What will you three prominent farmers do now?

BOGGIS Thirty-five. 
BEAN Bunce? 
BUNCE Thirty-six. 
BEAN And I've got thirty-seven. That's 108 men altogether. Now what do I got here? Two quitters -- or are you staying with? 
CUT TO: That night. A helicopter with a Bean, inc. decal on the side of it circles the crater scanning the dark terrain with a searchlight. There are tents, trucks, and 108 men gathered around the perimeter. They sit on bricks and logs and are armed with bats, pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows and arrows, and hatchets. 
INT. HOLE. NIGHT 
Fox, his family, and Kylie lie exhausted on the floor of their deep hole. The walls are covered with knotted roots and vines. Fox says to Kylie: 
FOX One of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now. 
KYLIE You're paranoid, Foxy. 
CUT TO: Mrs. Bean sitting in her kitchen watching television next to an extremely skinny, freckled twelve year-old boy. The boy points at the screen and laughs to himself:

{"train": "THE BOONDOCK SAINTS \nWritten by \nTROY DUFFY \nShooting Script:  White August 28, 1997 \nINT.  GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAY \nDOWNTOWN BOSTON \nAs we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery of the Lord\u0092s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor. \nThey do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. They mutter their words in Latin. \nCONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair. \nMONSIGNOR (dismissing young priest) Thank you Father Macklepenny, for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker today. I hope you found our little parish to your liking. \nMacklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride for the alter, eyes down, determined. \nANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.) (thick Irish accent) They've never been like anyone else. From the moment they were born, of the same womb, on the same day, they just had their own way, my boys did. And I always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness. I just never expected they would bring about such a... such a reckoning. \nThe MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary. \nThe monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance. \nThe elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous crucifix. \nThey both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon. \nMONSIGNOR (loud, authoritative) ...and I am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of Kitty Geneviese. This poor soul cried out time and time again for help but no person answered her calls. Though many saw, not one so much as called. Her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her lifeless little body. They watched as he simply walked away. Nobody wanted to get involved. Nobody wanted to take a stand... We must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against, what we must fear most (beat) Is the indifference of good men. \nThe MacManuses turn and walk out the door. \nEXT. CHURCH STEPS  SUNNY MORNING \nThe boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious to their synchronicity and mimic. \nCONNOR (Irish accent) I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point. \nMURPHY (Irish accent) Aye. \nThey leave. \nINT. NOLAND'S MEAT PACKING PLANT  4:00 P.M.  SAME DAY \nMurphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, and are looking at him. \nCONNOR What? \nMurphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab. \nConnor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both laugh and the workers cheer. \nTheir boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman. \nHer head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of breath, they turn. \nMCGERKIN Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle... Gurtle. \nROZ Rozengurtle Baumgartner. \nMCGERKIN You'll be training her today, and do a good job. \nBOTH BOYS Aye. \nCONNOR (wipes hand and extends it) Pleased ta meet ya Rozie. \nShe points to a tattoo on her neck that reads untouched by man. \nROZ I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men. \nROZ You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck up! Leave him there. \nRozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to Murphy. \nMurphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands on her back. The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and stands above her. \nMURPHY Guess you'll have ta change that tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!? \nINT. HALLWAY  MACMANUS' TENEMENT APT  BUILDING  DAY \nThe brothers get to the top of the stairs. Connor is hunched over and moving slowly. Murphy giggles. \nCONNOR Fuck you. \nConnor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading doors at the end of the hall. The red brick buildings stretch down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy resting place, directly next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APARTMENT  EARLY EVENING \nThis is a decrepit, illegal loft. The boys enter, hang their rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes. \nConnor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of ice on his crotch. Murphy stands naked in the open quantity shower. Murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the stream. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING \nConnor, still seated, cracks open a Guinness and sips it lovingly. The phone rings. \nCONNOR Hello. \nMOM (V.O.) Connor, is that you? \nSomething is obviously wrong in her voice. \nCONNOR (interested) Mother, is that you? \nMOM (V.O.) Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this. \nCONNOR Ma, what's wrong? \nMurphy shuts off the water. \nMURPHY No fuckin' hot water man. That... \nCONNOR Shut it. It's Ma. \nMurphy sees the concern in Connor's eyes and takes a step closer. \nMOM (V.O.) It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for. \nCONNOR Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here. \nMurphy is drawing closer with concern. \nMURPHY What's the matter with her? \nINT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' HOUSE  IRELAND  NIGHT \nA wrinkly female hand grabs a large revolver resting next to a half empty bottle of Hennessey. \nMOM I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING \nCONNOR What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!? \nMURPHY (widening eyes) What the...? \nMOM (V.O.) I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now. \nCONNOR What?! What are you doin'? \nMOM (V.O.) I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger. \nCONNOR (screaming) Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here. \nBOTH (genuflecting, impassionate) Mother Mary, full of grace. \nMOM What did you do, Connor? \nCONNOR Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts. \nMOM (aghast) What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one! \nCONNOR Well, I didn't but... \nMURPHY (shaking his fist) Don't worry, I respected the hell out of her for ya, Ma. \nMom laughs. \nMOM Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'. \nBOTH (semi-condescending) Yes mother. \nMOM (light-hearted anger) I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry. (grabbing her breast) My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN! \nThe boys laugh. \nMOM Promise me boys. \nMURPHY We promise. \nCONNOR Yeah, we promise. \nMOM Well, there's my boys. (pulls back curtain, looks out window) Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'. \nMURPHY All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh? \nCONNOR Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years. \nMOM Still bickerin' over that, huh? \nCONNOR Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first? \nMOM All right, I suppose you have the right ta know. \nThe boys stand shoulder to shoulder, naked. They peer into the distance, ears to the phone, awaiting this most important information. \nMOM Are ya ready? \nBOTH Aye. \nSlight pause as mom slams a shot of Hennessey. \nMOM (yells) The one with the biggest cock! \nMom slams down the phone and lets out a throaty laugh. The boys sign angrily. Connor walks over and hangs up the phone. \nCONNOR Crazy woman. \nWhen he turns, he notices Murphy is fixated on his brothers crotch. A triumphant smile spreads across his face. \nCONNOR Don't start. I've had ice on mine. \nEXT. AN ALLEY  MORNING \nPAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very good-looking, slender man. \nHe looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers. \nThey approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off. \nOne man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt out and a large cotton bandage is in its place. \nThe other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain- clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took place. \nThe chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position, where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them. \nGREENLY (thick Boston accent) ...so these guys are just kickin' the shit out of each other. This guy (points to Vladdy) Picks up an old kitchen sink that some one threw out and crushes this guy (Checkov) With it. All right, so it makes a big bang and alerts their friend, who's standin' look out around the corner. So he comes over and gets into it with this guy, (Vladdy) He's angry at him, right? They get into an altercation in which the look out guy crushes this guy by jumpin on him. And look at the damage here. (Vladdy) I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger man. His spine is crushed. He's all twisted and shit. That guy had to be one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 pounds, fuckin huge. \nDOLLY How did you know that? \nSMECKER Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue. \nCHAFFEY I can't find the second one, sir. \nSMECKER Look under the body. \nCHAFFEY (obeys) Got it. \nSmecker turns to detectives with a smirk. \nSMECKER You guy's ready for this? \nThey both nod. \nSMECKER This was no gangland assassination. Though creative, it was way too sloppy. Something went wrong here. This has personal written all over it. Now, these men were crushed and the first natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up. So now the two shots fired here were reflex rounds. These guys weren't shooting at anything, but they were just about to. \nMitchell returns. \nMITCHELL Agent Smecker, (pointing to MacManus building) This is all illegal loft housing so there's no manager on the premises but I found a lady on the fourth floor said she's had water dripping down on her whole place. Started just this morning. \nSMECKER Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading to the fifth. Let's go up and see just how right I am. \nINT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  FIRST FLOOR  MORNING \nThe detectives pile into the elevator, Smecker last. Greenly has rejoined them. Smecker sips his latte. \nDUFFY So what are you thinkin' here? \nSMECKER Really want to know? \nAll the detectives chant the affirmative. The doors close. \nINT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  ELEVATOR  FIFTH FLOOR  MORNING \nAs the doors open, all the detectives chorus their disbelief. \nGREENLY No way. You know how big a guy's gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge. \nSmecker turns to Greenly in disbelief. \nSMECKER (beat) Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel with my coffee. \nSmecker exits the elevator leaving the three silent detectives with that thought. \nGREENLY (to Dolly) I ain't getting him no fuckin' bagel. \nThe detectives exit the elevator. \nINT. MACMANUS' DOORWAY  INSIDE APT  LOOKING OUT TO HALL MORNING \nSmecker appears first, glancing in momentarily. The detectives pile in behind him. They survey the situation in total awe. \nSMECKER (to Greenly) We'll start the ass kissing with you. \nEXT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  FRONT STEPS  MORNING \nSmecker saunters out, detectives on his heels. \nMITCHELL (approaches Smecker) Agent Smecker. I know this neighborhood pretty good. There's a bar called McGinty's down the block. It's a good bet they were there last night. \nSMECKER (turns to detectives) Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that out myself. \nDuffy starts walking down the street. A REPORTER is hot on his heels. \nREPORTER Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened here? You owe me. This is the one I want. \nDUFFY Let's go get a cup of coffee. You ain't gonna fuckin' believe this one. \nSmecker is standing on the front steps in front of uniformed officers and homicide detectives. \nSMECKER I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more uniforms on the streets. One thing's for sure, wherever these guys are they're hurting. \nCHECKOV You insult me. I would never drink that sewage. Especially with you people. You are fools. \nCheckov slaps the beer to the floor. \nCHECKOV This is no game! If you won't go, we will make you go! \nThe boys look at each other, remembering what Mom said. \nThey still hold the shots. \nCONNOR If ya want a fight, you can see you're outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil here, so I suggest you take our offer. \nCHECKOV I make the offers, ass-hole. \nRocco pushes off the bar. He's had enough. \nROCCO (standing between the two brothers) Hey, there Boris. What would you say if I told you that your pinko, commie mother sucked so much dick... \nWham! Ivan punches him in the face. He is quickly down and out. Connor and Murphy's faces turn to stone as they speak the next few lines in flawless fluent Russian with English subtitles. \nCONNOR \"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?\" \nMURPHY \"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan.\" \nCheckov is completely taken aback. All the Irish are fairly impressed as well. \nCONNOR I don't think Ma would mind. \nThey clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down for the count, writhing on the floor. \nThe boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, pushing them all back. \nCONNOR Let the boy go. He knows what the fuck he's doing! \nThey all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine. \nThere is shock and silence. \nCONNOR Nicely done, boy! \nINT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT  A FEW MINUTES LATER \nThey have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach. \nConnor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks. \nThey all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage. \nTwo friends subdue him as all chuckle. \nCONNOR Now, like my fine brother says, on St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And this piece of shit is about to be initiated. \nAs they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the match on Ivan's butt. \nThe Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They furiously pat him out and turn on Connor. \nFRIEND #1 Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck? \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY NEXT MORNING \nConnor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds. \nThey wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain. \nBoom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in surprise. \nIvan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base. \nCHECKOV (almost whispering) I was going to kill you. But I'm not... I'm going to kill your brother. I'm going to take him down to the dumpster and I'm going to shoot him in the head. Then I'm going to throw his dead body in the garbage. (looks at this watch) Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, gotta go. \nCheckov walks towards the door and says \"let's go\" to Vladdy. \nMURPHY It was just a bar fight. You guys are fuckin' pussies! \nThe brothers laugh. Chaffey enters. \nCHAFFEY Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem. \nSMECKER What? \nCHAFFEY The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do? \nSMECKER You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them? \nCONNOR Absolutely not. \nMURPHY No pictures, either. \nSMECKER Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front. \nCONNOR Our mother can see through bags. \nMURPHY Aye, she can. (beat) Any way we can stay here? \nCHAFFEY Sure, we have an empty holding cell, They can... can they stay? \nSMECKER Well, we'll have to check with your mother, but it's ok with me if your friends sleep over. \nThey all chuckle. Chaffey is embarrassed. Smecker stands. \nSMECKER Time to feed the dogs. \nSmecker leaves. \nCONNOR He's a nice guy. \nMurphy speaks with the characteristic gay man's lingering \"S\". \nMURPHY Yes... he is. \nThey laugh. \nEXT. BOSTON POLICE STATION  FRONT STEPS  EARLY EVENING \nThe police chief is standing on the front steps of the police station making a statement to the ravenous press: cameras and pushy reporters. Agent Smecker stands slightly behind him. \nRocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins. \nCHIEF This is our official statement. The MacManus brothers are not being charged with a crime. It was a clean- cut case of self defense. We have thanked them for their cooperation and we thank you, the media, for your tireless pursuit of the truth. \nThe press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who has already passed him. \nINT. MACMANUS' CELLS  EARLY EVENING \nRocco approaches the wide open cell as Chaffey and Mitchell play cards with the brothers. Happy to see each other the boys and Rocco embrace. He hands them their clothes. \nINT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT \nThe boys are in a tight cell with a bed on each side. They are in their own clothes now. The brothers are fast asleep. \nSuddenly, they lurch forward, throwing their chests out, lips tight, still asleep. \nINT. POLICE STATION BATHROOM  NIGHT. \nAn officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash his hands. We go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain basin. An old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor. \nINT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT \nA water leak starts on the ceiling. It drips faster and faster. The water begins to follow a water damaged crack along the ceiling. It slowly spreads in two directions. \nThe brothers struggle for air in their sleep. Then slowly, and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something. \nTheir straining faces are brought from darkness to light as they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling. \nTheir eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads. \nThey look at each other across the room in shock as the drips of water still fall between them. \nRocco starts for the door. Vincenzo begins whispering in Yakavetta's ear. \nYAKAVETTA Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here. \nROCCO Yeah boss? \nVincenzo continues whispering for a few more seconds, long enough for Rocco to see. Vincenzo's lips are tight. His teeth grind. \nYAKAVETTA I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you? \nROCCO (totally intimidated) The... The funny man. \nYAKAVETTA The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke. \nROCCO (terrified) Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy. \nYAKAVETTA He's a nigger. \nROCCO Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, \"Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys... \nVINCENZO AND YAKAVETTA Niggers! \nROCCO Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the planet get double what he wishes for. \"I'll take a million dollars,\" he says. Genie give it to him and says every nigger on earth just got two million. \"I don't care gimme a yacht.\" Poof there it is. (intimidated, losing steam) E-every bl... every nigger just got two yachts. Genie goes... (gives up) I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This joke sucks. \nYakavetta takes a long pause. \nYAKAVETTA Continue the joke. \nROCCO (deflated) He says, \"What's your third wish?\" And the guys says, \"I-I want you to beat me half to death.\" \nThere's a long tense pause. Suddenly, Yakavetta throws his head back and roars with laughter. Vincenzo joins in. Rocco lets out a semi-audible sign of relief and gradually starts laughing himself. \nYAKAVETTA (still in guffaw) Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good stuff. Tell me another one. \nRocco returns to terror. Yakavetta erupts again pointing at Rocco. \nINT  COMMON BOSTON HOME  ANTEROOM  TWILIGHT \nConnor and Murphy give a huge Irishman guns, money and gold watches. He hands them two big black duffle bags and motions for them to help themselves as he counts the money. They enter a well equipped arsenal. They are giddy as they go on their first shopping spree. They toss in masks and gloves. \nThey toss in four identical black finished 9mm handguns with silencers. \nCONNOR Know what we need, man?... some rope. \nMURPHY For what? \nCONNOR Charlie Bronson's always got rope. \nMURPHY What? \nCONNOR Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it. \nMURPHY Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya? \nCONNOR I'm serious. \nMURPHY Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for. \nCONNOR I don't know they just always need it. \nMURPHY What is all this \"they\" shit? This ain't a movie. \nConnor pulls a large hunting knife from Murphy's bag. \nCONNOR Is that right, Rambo? \nMURPHY All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope. \nINT. SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nPaul Smecker lies in bed with his young lover, Reuben (mid- twenties). He has an innocent, feminine look and a GQ air about him. The two have just had sex and Reuben is far more excited about it than Smecker. \nReuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience. \nDUFFY (surprised) The fat man. \nSMECKER Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon? \nDUFFY He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head. \nSMECKER And the pennies? \nDUFFY New hitman wants to leave his mark \nSMECKER That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. (pause) Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent. \nDUFFY Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver. \nSMECKER The Greeks. The Italians. \nDUFFY The Sicilians. \nDOLLY What's the symbology there? \nSmecker tosses the Idiot glance to Dolly. \nSMECKER Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has relinquished his King Bone Head crown I see we have an heir to the throne. I'm sure the word you were looking for was symbolism. What's the symbolism there? Let me explain it to you. In Greek and Roman mythology when you died you would have to pay the toll to Charon, the boatman who ferried you across to the gates of judgment. This made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives, Detective... \nSmecker looks at his I.D. \nSMECKER Dollapoppaskalious. \nThe detectives are impressed. \nDOLLY (DOLLAPOPPASKALIOUS) Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that. \nSMECKER (aside) Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology. \nThe detectives chuckle. \nINT. PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT \nSmecker is chain smoking. His clothes appear unkempt. His eyes show emotion at every new found clue. The detectives watch closely. He is hunched over the body of the fat man probing his wounds with his gloved fingers. Greenly has re- entered. He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too intimidated to interrupt Smecker. He sets it down and folds his arms. \nSMECKER I've seen burns like these before. They used silencers. Look at these entry and exit wounds. They're identical. \nHe stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives. \nHe points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull. \nSMECKER The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy. \nDUFFY They shot him at a downward angle. (makes connection) They put him on his knees. \nSMECKER Excellent! Number two. Greenly. \nGREENLY Uh. (thinking hard) Shit, I, uh... \nSMECKER It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men (fans across the corpses with his hand) Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! (psychotic laugh) They sure as fuck did! \nA wide-eyed Duffy joins with Smecker, by nodding his head. \nSmecker is seducing all of them. \nSMECKER And number three, Dolly. \nDOLLY Uh... two shooters! \nSMECKER Fan-fuckin-tastic! \nGreenly and Duffy want to know how. \nSMECKER Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote! \nDUFFY What about one guy with two guns? \nSMECKER Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two. \nThey jump into the air shaft. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nThey start crawling with Connor in front and Murphy behind. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThe plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living room. \nHis eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U- shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nConnor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is starting to look a bit confused. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThe fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming and pointing at each man. \nThey seem to be taking it seriously. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nTheir brows are drenched with sweat. Murphy crawls up next to Connor. There is only enough room for the two to lie on their sides facing each other. \nMURPHY Where the fuck are you going? \nCONNOR We'll find it. Just calm down. \nMURPHY No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds. \nMurphy takes off the rope. \nCONNOR We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole. \nMURPHY Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! \nCONNOR Sh, sh! Fuck you! \nConnor grabs Murphy's shirt. \nMURPHY No, fuck you! \nThe boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThey crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as they spin. Taking four shots apiece. \nThere are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted over the couch. \nThey notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in \na heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison. \nBOTH And shepherds we shall be. For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. So we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et Fili e spiritu sancti. \nWith the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with Latin script being read in the background. They take their rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle. \nCONNOR (looks up) That was some good fuckin' rope. \nThey both laugh. \nMURPHY That was way easier than I thought. \nCONNOR Aye. \nMURPHY On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch. \nCONNOR Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes. \nMURPHY Oh, we're good man. \nMURPHY Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it. \nRocco ponders this as the boys continue to clean their weapons. \nROCCO You guys should be in every major city. \nThe boys chuckle. Rocco steadily works himself into a humorous frenzy. \nROCCO This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know? \nMURPHY (chuckling) Hallelujah, Jaffar. \nROCCO So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit? \nThe boys look at each other and nod. \nROCCO Well fuck, you guys could do this every day. \nMURPHY We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open. \nCONNOR Nicely put. \nINT.   ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NIGHT  ONE HOUR LATER \nThe three are partying hard. There's a pizza surrounded by Guinness cans as they whoop it up, sitting at the round table. \nRocco wears one of the masks. They're all drunk. The house cat is lounging on the table comfortably. \nROCCO You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy. \nMURPHY Who says that? You could take credit on it. \nROCCO What are you serious? \nMURPHY Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit. \nCONNOR Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco. \nROCCO Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place. \nThe boys nod in agreement. \nROCCO (working into a frenzy) They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they can suck my pathetic little dick. And I'll dip my nuts in marinara just so the fat fucks can get a taste of home while they're at it. That's it, it's done, I'm doing it. \nRocco slams his fist down on the table next to Murphy's gun. \nThe gun goes off with a bang! and blows the lounging cat right off the table. A softball-sized hole is blasted in the wall as a large splatter of blood sprays the area surrounding the hole. Everyone is in shock for a second. \nMURPHY I can't fuckin' believe that just happened! \nINT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NEXT MORNING  11:30 A.M. \nThe three are passed out all over the apartment. Rocco awakens. He stumbles past the wall with the large, round, pink stain on it. There is a crooked picture hanging in the middle of it. \nRocco staggers to the kitchen and throws water in his face over a sinkful of dirty dishes. Connor awakens, grabs his jacket and follows Rocco out. \nEXT.  ROCCO'S FRONT STEPS  CONTINUOUS \nCONNOR (hung over) Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. \nROCCO Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. (beat) But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. \nCONNOR (chuckles) You sound real remorseful. \nConnor lights up two smokes and hands one to Rocco. \nROCCO She ain't been around in weeks anyhow. \nCONNOR (beat) Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night. \nROCCO What? \nCONNOR Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room? \nCONNOR (packing up gear) Who did you kill? \nMURPHY (packing up gear) Holy shit. Who? How many? \nROCCO (rummaging through his drawers) Hurry the fuck up! \nMURPHY This is some crazy shit, man! \nROCCO Those cocksuckers sold me out! \nCONNOR Did I fuckin' tell ya, Rocco? They pull on you first? \nDONNA ROCCO! \nROCCO What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview. \nCONNOR Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit! \nMURPHY Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of coconut balls man! \nDONNA/RAYVIE ROCCO! \nROCCO (turns in rage) What? \nDONNA (softly) Where's my cat? \nROCCO (slight pause) I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch! \nDONNA (shocked, hurt) You... oh god, why? \nROCCO I felt it would bring closure to our relationship! \nDONNA (crying) You killed my... my... \nShe stops, unsure of the cat's name. \nROCCO (screaming) Your what?! Your fuckin' what?! \nDONNA My, my... \nROCCO (puts his gun to his own head) Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... (waiting for her response) \nDONNA (flustered, crying) Pee...Per...Man. \nROCCO Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!! \nDONNA It was... It was... \nROCCO Male or female, bitch?!! \nRAYVIE Don't you yell at her you fuckin' prick! \nROCCO Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't buy a pack of smokes without running into nine guys you fucked. \nDONNA Don't you yell at her! \nRocco rummages through her purse and finds her car keys. \nROCCO All right, let's get the fuck outta here! \nThey exit. Rayvie and Donna are hugging each other, crying. \nRAYVIE Is my... I mean it's not really...? \nDONNA No. No. It's not fat. \nINT.  CAR  EARLY EVENING \nRocco is in the back. Connor is driving. \nROCCO Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man! \nMURPHY You sure you killed them? \nThe three wind down long dark hallways with Rocco leading the way until they reach a green door. The boys stand, side by side, directly in front of it. Rocco is just behind them. \nThe three pull identical 9mm.'s and the boys pull on their masks. Rocco puts on a mask that he made from a dock worker's cotton hat. He looks ridiculous. \nMURPHY Okay Roc, this is... \nHe turns and is instantly taken with laughter at Rocco's appearance. Connor turns, and has the same reaction. \nROCCO What? You guys got masks. \nThey are now pointing and laughing. \nMURPHY (through laughter) You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert. \nROCCO (takes off mask) Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no... \nCONNOR (still laughing) No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it back on. It's good. \nHe begrudgingly puts it back on. They reassume their position. \nCONNOR (imitating mush mouth) Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B? \nINT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT \nThey burst into the room, climb up a few steps and are in a small round room with a couch in it. A topless dancer sits, smoking and drinking coffee, on the couch in front of three big black steel doors with money slots in them. Rocco seizes her, puts a hand over her mouth and a gun to her head. \nROCCO Which one is he in? \nShe points to the middle door. \nROCCO (takes his hand off her mouth) What's his routine? \nDANCER H... h... he jerks off in there. Th... then he puts money through the slot and I raise the door. \nMURPHY How? \nShe points to an orange button. Each door has a button to the left of it. \nROCCO Then what? \nDANCER He watches me do my thing and f- finishes himself off. \nINT.  SIN BIN  CENTER BOOTH  NIGHT \nWe see the fuzzy reflection of a cheap porno movie being reflected in Vincenzo's Elvis style sunglasses. He is shaking as he masturbates. \nVINCENZO (grunting, muttering) Don't you talk to me like that, you dirty little... give it to daddy... give it ta da King... garbage mouth, garbage mouth. \nINT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT \nRocco is looking through the peep hole down on Vincenzo. He still holds the terrified, crying dancer. \nROCCO Oh man. He is some sicko. \nThey back up and focus on the money slot. A hundred dollar bill comes through. Connor gives it to the dancer. \nCONNOR You've earned this. \nThe boys begin to recite their prayer. Rocco is smiling and excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer. \nThey press the button. The door goes straight up. Vincenzo has one moment of shock before the MacManuses decimate him through the glass with silenced bullets. The glass silently spiders and begins to fall in spots. His chest explodes, sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth. \nThe dancer faints and Rocco lays her down gently. \nThe boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual. \nRocco watches intently, intrigued. They finish and turn around to see Rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious dancer's breasts. They pull up their masks. \nCONNOR What the fuck are you doing? \nROCCO I-I'll tip her. \nMURPHY We've teamed up with a sex offender. \nAUGUSTUS Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here. \nYAKAVETTA Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something. \nAUGUSTUS Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster. \nINT.  PRISON PROCESSING ROOM  DAY \nThis is a gigantic three tiered room with guards on all tiers. \nThey all cock their shotguns. \nA PRISONER is shackled barefoot to a small metal cart on wheels. His hands are cuffed before him with a chain linking his hands and feet. A guard is pulling the cart through the prison to the parole board room by a long chain. The cons have their mirrors out to get a better look. His face is in shadow as he bows his head. \nA metal cage is lowered around him from the ceiling. The parole board looks him over. A stenographer sits poised \nMR. COBB (English accent) Do you feel you have been rehabilitated? \nNo response is given by the prisoner. The stenographer looks at MR. COBB who gives her the nod. She begins typing though no words are spoken. \nINT.  RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  DAY \nAUGUSTUS I've had this guy in front of me, and I couldn't tell you what he looks like, sounds like. He is the Picasso of assassins, kid. He plants hair samples, blood. Puts skin under fingernails. He is a fucking genius. Only one problem. He's been rotting in prison for twenty-five or thirty years. Don't even know if he's still alive. Or if he's even up to it. \nAugustus hands him a piece of paper he scribbled on. \nYAKAVETTA There's ways around that. \nAUGUSTUS Go find one. \nINT.  PAROLE PROCESSING ROOM  DAY \nA large piece of paper is placed on the table and stamped with the words parole granted across it. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM  BOSTON  DAY \nThe prisoner, Il Duce enters. He is clad in a long dark trench coat with the collar pulled up, dark round glasses and a dark hat. He puts a suitcase on the bed. \nHe walks over to the window. He slowly puts his hand outside and watches the sun bounce off it. Tears begin to flow from beneath his glasses as he breaks down. He begins to take off his clothes as he weeps, casting them aside. \nEXT.  HOTEL ROOM FIRE ESCAPE  BACK ALLEY  DUSK \nThe Duke is fully naked, except for a hotel blanket which is wrapped around his waist, sitting on the fire escape. He smiles and is still misty-eyed as he beholds the sun setting. \nScattered around him are all the furnishings of freedom; Snickers bars, all kinds of empty candy wrappers, Coke cans, and many assorted magazines. \nINT.  COFFEE HOUSE  NIGHT  2:00 A.M. \nRocco and the brothers sit in an old Boston coffee house. \nROCCO Let's talk some business here. I know a sick fuck... makes the ones we been doing look like altar boys. Worst night of my life when I met this guy. \nFLASHBACK  EXT.  SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER-TYPE HOUSE  DUSK \nRocco waits in a late model Chevelle in front of a white house. A man exits the house and walks across the sprawling front lawn. Rocco leans over and says How ya doin', man? \nThe man doesn't respond and sits in the passenger seat. \nDuring the following scenes we FLASHCUT between bits of Rocco's experience that night to the coffee house and catch bits of dialogue as he explains. \nROCCO The guy never says a fuckin' word to me. We're driving for 25 minutes. Never a sigh, no throat clearing, nothing. And his face, blank man. Just nothing there. \nEXT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  NIGHT  CONTINUED \nFLASHCUT: They pull up to a house in a scummy, Boston Logan Airport neighborhood. Rocco gets out and sits on the hood smoking as the man makes his way up the walk. \nINT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  CONTINUED \nTwo tough looking wiseguys walk across a hallway cocking shotguns. They disappear into a room. \nFLASHCUT : He quietly enters the house and pulls a large bright-blue plastic tarp from his coat and spreads it across the floor in the hallway. We hear the sound of Sega video games being played. He pulls out two pistols with silencers and walk. \nHe disappears into the living room. Two white flashes and the sounds of silencers. A hookerish looking mom enters frame in the B.G. in the kitchen. She is talking on the phone. She disappears from view. The man reappears and walks to the kitchen. A white flash and the sounds of silencer. \nConnor, Murphy and Rocco sit in a parked van, down the street from the Beaver Cleaver house. The three are sitting next to each other in the longer back seat. They have a counter in front of them with all their guns and accessories on it. \nThe clicking of bullets into clips, and smacking of clips into guns are heard. Smecker sits in the captain's chair directly across from them, calmly smoking a cigarette. They finish their preparation. Rocco holds up his guns. \nSMECKER They waited in a parked car down the street for the kid to leave. \nMurphy spies a young boy peddling his bike out of the driveway. He goes to the front of the van. \nMURPHY There he goes. (turns back to them, pulls his guns) Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord? \nCONNOR (cocks his pistol) A-fuckin'-men! \nROCCO This is so fuckin' cool! \nEXT.  SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE  DAY \nConnor, Murphy, and Rocco make a frenzied exit from the van and walk across the front lawn, each carrying a black duffle bag and clutching a mask. The garage is opened a crack. \nThey pull it up all the way. The sun shines in on Smecker who stands there smoking. \nINT.  SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  GARAGE  DAY \nThey enter and close the door behind them \nSMECKER They went in through the garage. The kid says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out. \nThey dive into their bags and suit up with leather gloves, masks, navy P-coats and their guns. \nINT.  SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  DAY \nThe three open the door and enter the house and walk deliberately down the hallway. \nSMECKER (V.O.) Now, they know the wife is the gate keeper. She knows the code. \nEXT. SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  BACKYARD  DAY \nThey walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel door pool house entrance. There is a number pad next to the door. Rocco positions her in front of it. \nROCCO Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill you. \nShe slowly punches in the numbers. Smecker is standing there smoking. \nSMECKER The wife says she doesn't know what happened after she hit the code. She just remembers going down. But, judging by the burn mark on her back, I think what they did... \nRocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it. She goes down. \nSMECKER ...was use a stun gun on her. \nConnor reaches for the knob but Rocco stops him. They wait, guns drawn and focus on the door knob. \nSMECKER Now the guy knows a friend is coming to the game. And they know that this door can only be opened from the inside. So they wait... and when that door opens, man... \nThe knob turns and they kick it in. \nINT.  POOLHOUSE - DAY \nThey burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder, guns aimed. \nSmecker stands beside Rocco with his thumb and forefinger extended to mimic guns. Five mafiosos sit around a poker table in front of time. Two men are playing pool to their left. Rocco quickly scans the room. \nROCCO All of them. \nThey begin firing. Men are dying, their chests exploding. \nSmecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the noise. \nSMECKER Nobody was ready for it. Devastation, panic! This was like shooting fish in a fuckin' barrel! \nSmecker points to the pool table as the two players dive under it. \nSMECKER Now these guys dove under the table. The trajectory on the bullets show they came from straight across. So this means one of our shooters... dropped to his knees... \nSmecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with Rocco. They are side by side and leaning back. \nRocco exits a package store just down the street. He is opening a new pack of cigarettes. He is surprised when he sees Smecker at the other end of the block. He follows the stumbling agent, fumbling for his gun. \nEXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH  EARLY MORNING \nPaul sees a church and reflects for a moment before crossing the street and going in, Rocco a safe distance behind. \nINT.  CHURCH  EARLY MORNING \nConnor and Murphy are at prayer in the back of the church. \nIt is mostly empty because of the early hour. \nConnor looks up and sees Smecker and Rocco way up in the front. His eyes are ablaze. He is up and walking and does not bother Murphy, who remains penitent. There are two confessional booths with a priest booth in the middle. \nSmecker goes in the booth on the far left. Rocco tries the door, it's locked. A middle-aged PRIEST slips a key in the priests booth and opens the door. Rocco shoves him in and goes in behind him. Connor has quickened his pace. He tries both doors. They're locked. He goes into the confessional on the right. \nINT.  CHURCH  PRIEST'S BOOTH  EARLY MORNING \nRocco puts his gun to the priest's head. \nROCCO You gonna do what I say, got it? \nPRIEST Yes. \nROCCO I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me! \nPRIEST I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see. \nROCCO Shut up! Shut the fuck up! \nINT.  CHURCH  CONNOR'S CONFESSIONAL  EARLY MORNING \nConnor is furiously working his fingers through the lattice work to open the slider to the priest's booth from his side. \nINT.  CHURCH  PRIEST'S BOOTH  EARLY MORNING \nRocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the slider to Smecker's booth, gun to the back of his head. \nPRIEST Don't do this my son. \nROCCO Open it! \nPRIEST Have you no fear of God? \nROCCO That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing. \nConnor gets the slider open. Rocco's long hair hangs just inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of Rocco's hair. Rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his head. \nROCCO Father, I'll do you right here. \nPRIEST (slowly obey, whispering) God have mercy on my soul. \nRocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to Smecker's now open slider. \nJust then Connor snags a piece of Rocco's hair and pulls him back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the lattice work. Rocco grabs the priest back into position. \nConnor grabs a nice wad of Rocco's hair with his left hand, so that the side of Rocco's face is now pressed to the lattice. Connor then puts a gun to Rocco's head. \nCONNOR (hard whisper) You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here. \nROCCO Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing. \nCONNOR Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. (pulls hammer back) \nROCCO You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man. \nINT.  CHURCH CONFESSIONAL BOOTHS  EARLY MORNING \nSmecker wakes up from a drunken stupor. He looks through the slider window at the barely discernible face of the now crying priest. \nSMECKER (slurred, loud) Hello? You there? \nPRIEST Y-Yes my son. \nROCCO (whispers to priest) Goddam right, I am. \nSMECKER I'm beginning to see. I've been doing my job... well for fifteen years and it's just not enough. All the things I wish I could do, these guys are doing. Millions of dollars in tax payers' money wasted on shit like wire taps and surveillance. Theses boys go in and take care of it for the price of a bullet. (looks up) Ww-what do you think I should do? Because I'm a law man. \nRocco jostles the priest again. \nPRIEST The laws of God are higher than the laws of man. \nSMECKER (the clouds have lifted) Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them. \nPRIEST (whispers) Forgive me father. \nSMECKER Thank you, Father, thank you. (he attempts the sign of the cross but screws it up) Whatever. Goodbye, amen. \nSmecker exits and they all let go after a brief pause. Rocco turns and starts fixing up the priest's ruffled suit. \nROCCO I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father. (signs cross) Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone. \nPRIEST Just go! \nINT.  CHURCH  EARLY MORNING \nRocco exits the booth and shuts the door behind him. Connor is standing outside, hands on his hips. Rocco smiles at him as Connor fumes. \nROCCO (giggling) The Lord works in mysterious ways. \nConnor slaps him in the back of the head and kicks him in the ass. Rocco's still giggling as they exit. \nINT.  PHONE BOOTH  UPTOWN  LATER \nSMECKER That's all you can give me? \nINT.  PHONE BOOTH  DOWNTOWN  CONTINUOUS \nWe shoot alternating coverage between the two locations. \nCONNOR Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties. \nSMECKER So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen? \nCONNOR I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again. \nSMECKER I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you? \nCONNOR We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here. \nSMECKER Be careful. \nCONNOR I'll call you tonight, afterwards. (hangs up) \nINT.  RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  NIGHT \nSmecker stands beside Augustus, just the way Yakavetta did. \nAUGUSTUS I don't know who he is. Nobody does. \nSmecker tosses an envelope of cash in his plate, just as Yakavetta did. \nSMECKER What did he bring him in for? \nAUGUSTUS Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away. \nSMECKER Just for him? \nAUGUSTUS Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there. \nSMECKER Up where? \nAUGUSTUS Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid. \nSMECKER Oh fuck! (runs out) \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT HALL  NIGHT \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S FRONT FOYER  NIGHT \nThere is a knock at the door. Geno jumps with fright and then looks out the peep hole. He sees a well-formed pair of woman's breasts in a cheap dress. He opens the door. A stunning blonde stands before him. She looks like a hooker. \nShe wears a short, hot pink dress and a white scarf around her neck, as well as six inch platform heels. \nSMECKER AS WOMAN Joey Bevo sent me over. As entertainment. \nThe woman speaks and it is apparent that this is actually Smecker in drag. \nGENO Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night for this shit. (beat) Bevo's so great. Always sending us hot girls. \nSMECKER You look like you could use a quickie. \nSmecker kisses him full on the lips and rubs up against him. \nGeno is convinced. He brings her inside. \nGENO Hey, Chappy! \nCHAPPY (Chappy, emerges way down the hall) What the fuck? \nGENO I ain't been laid in a week. Take five minutes. \nCHAPPY If I die cause you're getting a piece of ass, I'll come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick. \nGENO Don't worry about it. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  NIGHT \nHe takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer. \nThey are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker uses a silencer, shoots him in the head. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  HALL  NIGHT \nHe starts to whisper, \"It's on now. It's on now. Too far.\" as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses. \nHe is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him. \nThe Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT \nConnor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. \nHe rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. \nThe boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. \nHe stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks. \nINT.  CHEAP BOSTON HOTEL ROOM  NIGHT  3 MONTHS LATER \nBoth sleeping boys throw their arms out, mimicking a crucified Christ. Their father turns, sees this, turns back. \nThe boys wake with a start. Connor looks to his father, who is already staring at him. \nCONNOR How far are we going with this, Da? \nFATHER The questions is not, \"how far?\" The question is, \"Do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith to go as far as is needed?\" \nINT.  COURTHOUSE  BACK FOYER AREA  MORNING \nSmecker opens the door from the inside and lets the MacManus father and sons in. He walks one way they walk the other through the grand courthouse halls. \nINT.  COURTROOM  MORNING \nThe media, with their cameras and notebooks, are at the back of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He is cocky. The judge warns Yakavetta that he will have no more of this behavior in his courtroom. \nMEDIA MAN 1 (whispering to #2) Look at his charisma. He's the next John Gotti. \nMEDIA MAN 2 He'll walk. Even with all this evidence. \n", "test1_input": "SMECKER Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah. \nMITCHELL What makes you think they're dangerous? They were just protecting each other. \nEXT. BOSTON POLICE STATION STEPS  DAY \nThe two are limping up the precinct stairs. Connor is draped over Murphy who helps his brother along, they are still attired as in the E.R. \nINT. BOSTON POLICE STATION  PRECINCT OFFICE  DAY \nSMECKER Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one. \nCHAFFEY Any tips on where these guys may be? \nSMECKER (to Officer Mitchell) \nAny word back from the E.R.s? \nMITCHELL No help at all. Swamped from St. Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody Irish. \nSMECKER Just hit the bricks nice and hard. \nGrunt police work is going to bring this one in. \nGREENLY (talking loudly) These guys are miles away by now. \nThe brothers quietly enter in the back of the room. All the officers are seated with their backs to them. Smecker and the brothers make eye contact. He knows who they are. They don't interrupt Greenly. \nGREENLY But if you want to beat your head against a wall, then here's what you look for. These guys are scared like two little bunny rabbits. Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights will spook them. So the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and drag it through South Boston. \nThere is light chuckling from the police at this crack. \nMURPHY (loud) You'd probably have better luck with a beer. \nEveryone turns and looks. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM  BOSTON POLICE STATION  LATER \nThe boys sit in two chairs at a plain table with a recording device on it. They are very serious and alert. Mitchell enters with coffee for them. He shakes their hands and says he really respects what they did. Surprised, they thank him. Chaffey enters with donuts and a repeat performance of respect. Slowly officers start to gather around the interrogation room door. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM  BOSTON POLICE STATION  DAY LATER \nThere are at least 20 officers and detectives packed in the tiny room. The MacManus' visit with the excited cops. All are in high spirits. \nThe room is loud as Smecker walks in. \nSMECKER What the fuck is this!? This isn't a fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only thing I want in here is them. \nThey all file out. Smecker and the boys look each other over. \nSMECKER This conversation is going to be recorded. Just answer to the best of your knowledge. \nSmecker reaches for the record button. Murphy puts out his hand to stop him. \nMURPHY (politely) Excuse me, sir. \nMurphy turns to his brother and speaks in Latin, in hushed tones. It is subtitled in English. \nMURPHY \"What do we tell him about the guns and money?\" \nCONNOR \"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there.\" \nMURPHY (to Smecker) Okay. We're ready. \nSmecker in intrigued with this tiny display. He hits the record button. \nSMECKER You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh? \nCONNOR We... met them last night. \nSMECKER They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that? \nThey look at each other. \n", "test1_true": "McGinty's's is packed to the walls with drunken Irish. A lot of faces are recognizable from Noland's Meat. Connor is in front of the bar. He and Doc are staring at each other as if waiting for one man to give in. Connor has his arms across the chests of Murphy and some friends, holding them in place. They are interested in the competition. \nPRESENTLY... \nCONNOR (presently, imitating Doc's voice) Would someone please come over here and... \nDOC Fuck! \nCONNOR me up the... \nDOC Ass! \nEveryone falls down laughing. Doc is angry and starts throwing ice at them. DAVID DELLA ROCCO makes his way through the crowd. Rocco is thirty-two years old. He has shoulder-length, dark hair and a full beard and mustache that wrap around his big smile. He charges up to the bar and yells to Doc. \nROCCO Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer! \nThis sends everyone even further into laughter. Doc throws two huge fists full of ice at him. He backs away laughing. \nThe boys get up off the floor and have a huge group hug with Rocco as they all scream each others names. \nThey all laugh and commence drinking. \nINT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT \nThe bar is trashed. It's mostly empty now except for the brothers, Rocco, Doc and four friends. Everyone is very drunk, including Doc. \nROCCO (trying to connect with Connor) ...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm just afraid of faggots. \nConnor pauses then bursts out laughing. Doc calls everyone to gather round. \nDOC I got some bad news. Looks like I'm gonna have ta close d-down the bar. The Russians have been buying up buildings all over town, including this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're not letting me renew my lease. I got 'til the end of the week to come up with 26,000 dollars, or they take the place. I left them a note telling them not to show their faces t- tonight. They been pressuring me ta close and take the last few days ta get all my shit outta here but it's my right to stay open ta the last. \nLong pause as everyone absorbs. They are upset. \nROCCO Let me talk to my boss, may I can... \nHe is cut off by everyone who obviously opposes Mafia involvement. \nDOC L-l-listen I don't want anyone ta know until the last possible moment. So you guys keep your traps shut. ya know what they say; People in glass houses sink ships. \nEveryone has quizzical looks on their faces. \nROCCO Y'know Doc, I gotta get you a, a, like a proverb book or something. This mix and match shit's gotta go. \nDOC What? \nEveryone chuckles. \nCONNOR (imitating Doc) A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush. \nMURPHY (imitating Doc) Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen. \nEveryone laughs heartily. Just then, three large Russians in suits enter. The obvious leader, CHECKOV, stands in front with VLADDY behind one of Checkov's shoulders, with another guy behind the other shoulder. They mean business. The laughter fades. \nCHECKOV (thick Russian accent) I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing now. \nMURPHY (after a long pause) This is McCoy... we find Spock and we got enough for an away team. \nEveryone laughs. Ivan is angry. \nCHECKOV Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of Irishmen... and they are being drunken idiots. You are killing the stereotype. I'm in no mood for discussion. (points to Doc) You! You stay. The rest of you go now. \nDOC Why don't you make like a tree and get the fuck outta here! \nThe locals roll their eyes at Doc's blunder. \nCONNOR Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're reasonable fellows. \nHe and Murphy each grab a Guinness and a shot of Hennessey and they approach the Russians with the peace offering. \nCONNOR Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya? \nMURPHY Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us? \n", "test1_id": 2385, "test2_input": "DOLLY (approaches Smecker) She was in here when it went down. \nSMECKER Can she I.D. them? \nDOLLY They were wearing masks. \nSMECKER Of course they were. How many? \nDOLLY Three. \nSmecker looks at Dolly surprised. \nDOLLY Only two did the shooting. (beat) So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation? \nSMECKER Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here. \nSmecker sits next to the girl. He has Compassion. She Cries. \nSMECKER Probably shouldn't work another shift for awhile. \nDANCER Fuck this job. I'm getting out of the porno business and I don't care who I gotta blow to do it. \nINT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT \nThe bodies have been removed and chalk outlines replace them. \nThe bullet holes in the walls have been marked either A or B. The detectives watch Smecker. He is a mess. His clothes are disheveled and his hair is frazzled. \nSMECKER After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out. (pause) Why the two extra victims? \nGREENLY Witness? \nSMECKER No way they could have seen it. \nSmecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the first booth. He does the same thing to the last booth, leaving the middle one open. Both doors possess peep holes. \nSMECKER (sarcastic) Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's (makes a masturbatory gesture with hand) little fireman time. \nDUFFY No way they could have seen it? \nSMECKER Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why? \nDOLLY Maybe the three of them had something in common. \nSMECKER No. This guy is big time. (points to middle booth) These two are street-walking scum. \nGREENLY (kidding) Then that's what they had in common. They were all bad guys... now they're all dead bad guys. \nSmecker seems side-tracked and ponderous at Greenly's observation. He hits the orange buttons and raises the doors. \nSMECKER We got another thing to think about here. We got us a genuine Kennedy assassination style bullet theory. Two guns were used here, guns A and B. The guy in the middle was done with both. But this guy... (denotes right booth) ...he was killed with bullets from gun A only. And this guy... (denotes left booth) ...gun B only. But ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from over here where the victim was done with A. \nSmecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth on the left. Each is marked \"B\". He walks over to the right booth where in the exact location are two identical holes marked \"A\". \nSMECKER And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? (beat) Theories. \nDOLLY That's just fucking weird. I have no idea. \nDUFFY Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out. \nSMECKER What? \nDUFFY A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him. \nSMECKER (angry) Why was I not informed of this? \nGREENLY They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur. \nSMECKER Who were the victims? \nGREENLY A couple of peons for the mob and... \nSMECKER (livid) Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW! \n", "test2_true": "Smecker comes barreling back in, shoving them out of the way. He looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked \"A and B\" again. Something has clicked. \nSMECKER (wide-eyed) Oh... it looks like we got us a cowboy. \nINT. LAKEVIEW LUNCH  NIGHT \nSmecker surveys photos and papers, as he smokes profusely. \nHe stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked over. Body chalk and blood stains are everywhere. The detectives seem like they don't want to be there, again. \nSMECKER The shooter knew these guys, huh? \nDOLLY How do you figure? \nSMECKER Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends. \nSmecker flashes them a photo of a dead body. The victim is shot in the head and face down in his plate of food. His hands are on the table in front of him. \nSMECKER These guys were packing. Not one hand near a gun. It's simple human behavior. Someone you don't know approaches you, you put your hand on it. This guy's got his hands on the table. He's eating his food, for Christ sakes. They were friends. \nSmecker looks over the bar. \nSMECKER These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender? \nDUFFY Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets. \nSMECKER Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident. \nDUFFY Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking. \nSMECKER Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. (angry) God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet. \nHe storms to the entry way. \nINT.  LAKEVIEW LUNCH  ENTRY WAY  NIGHT \nSmecker walks across the street, still angry, and goes to a payphone. There's an extreme close-up on his hand as he puts in a quarter. As the quarter jingles in... \nFLASHBACK  EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF LAKEVIEW LUNCH  DAY \n...there is a close-up on a hand pulling back from the coin slot. The hand moves up to pull a cigarette from its possessor's mouth. It is Rocco. He dials the phone. \nMURPHY (V.O.) Hello? \nROCCO Hey, Murph. \nMURPHY (V.O.) Roc. You okay? \nROCCO Yeah. Anybody call for me? \nMURPHY (V.O.) No. You sure you're okay? \nROCCO I'm fuckin' fine. (beat) Catch you on the flip side. \nHe goes across the street and enters Salamone's. \nINT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  DAY \nDonna and Rayvie are laying on the couch. Connor is spit- shining his boots by the window. Murphy lights his cigarette on the gas stove and pours some salt in a pot of water with a handful of pennies boiling to a shine in it. Rocco bursts through the door, hysterical. Tears are streaming down his face. \nROCCO Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! \nCONNOR (hopping into his boots) What happened? \nROCCO I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!! \nDONNA Rocco? \nMURPHY Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us what happened! \nROCCO No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go! \nDONNA Rocco! \n", "test2_id": 2386, "test3_input": "Rocco, Connor and Murphy walk toward the front door. \nEXT.  SUBURBANK \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  SIDEWALK  DAY \n(Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house. \nEXT.  SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT STOOP  DAY \nThe boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of them. They look out to the walk, stunned. \nSMECKER Now they are staring at six guys with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush. \nOur three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded in front of him. \nSuddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and aims. \nSMECKER And this was a fucking bomb dropping in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few seconds this place was Armageddon! There was a fire fight! \nThey all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening. \nThe Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles. \nRocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls a gun and starts firing. \nMurphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk. \nIt's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment. \nConnor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and his own blood splattered on the sidewalk. \nIL DUCE No!... No! No!... \nHe drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on the stoop. \nThe Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two blood stains. \nIn a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house. \nThey then pick up their things and run off. \nEXT. SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT LAWN  DAY \nSmecker comes back to reality and lights a cigarette in front of Dolly, Duffy, and Greenly. \nGREENLY What if it was just one guy with six guns? \nSMECKER Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius? \nHe turns to the forensics guys at the front of the house and begins to walk over to him. \nSMECKER What is taking so long with those blood samples? \nFORENSICS WOMAN #1 I can't get a good sample. There is variable here I'm not seeing. \nSmecker puts his finger through a big blood stain on the door and smells it. \nSMECKER (in shock, and rage) They used ammonia... none of this shit is any good... Fuck... You know what this means?! Even if we get suspects in this case, we got nothing... Nothing! \nHe starts kicking the bushes and trying to tear them with his hands as he rages. The police and forensics all back off. \nSMECKER (screaming) Who the fuck are they?! I've never seen any-fucking-thing like this in my whole fucking life. Who the fuck are they?!! \nHe backs against the building and slides down to a sitting position in the bushes as if he has given up. He raises his head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered in the bushes. He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket and scoops it up. He shoves it back into his pocket and races off. \nDUFFY What? That's it?! \nINT.  ROCCO'S MOM'S KITCHEN  NIGHT \nRocco, Connor, and Murphy are sitting around the table. \nThey are numb with pain and silently sipping beers. Suddenly, Smecker comes on the news making an announcement that he is heading up the investigation to find the three of them. \nRocco shuts it off. \n", "test3_true": "ROCCO What? (points to TV) What, that guy? \nMURPHY That's the guy that got us off the hook with the \"Checkov\" thing. \nCONNOR And he is one smart man. \nROCCO They got nothing. \nCONNOR This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will. \nMURPHY You bet your ass he will. \nROCCO Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility. \nThe boys look at each other. \nCONNOR He isn't to be touched. \nMURPHY He's a good man. \nROCCO Okay... whatever. (looking at the bloody mess) My Mom's gonna kill me. \nINT.  SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nSmecker is sitting at a computer terminal. He has just hooked into the F.B.I.'s computer network with his authorization code. He is disgusted as he puts on surgical gloves and finger prints the severed finger onto a scanner. He waits for a moment. Rocco's face and rap sheet come up on his screen. He is in disbelief. \nSMECKER No. This is all wrong. David Della Rocco? \nFLASHBACK  EXT.  POLICE STATION FRONT STEPS \nRocco on the steps of the police station when Rocco brought the boys their clothes. \nBACK TO PRESENT  INT.  SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT \nHe picks up the phone. \nMARIA (V.O.) Boston Police Department. \nSMECKER Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could you find me the visitor's list for the day the MacManus brothers were in and read me all the names? \nShe reads a few names then hits David Della Rocco. \nSMECKER Okay, thank you. \nHe hangs us, puts in a smoke, and knocks his head back in deep thought. \nINT.  GAY BAR  NIGHT \nSmecker is drinking like a fiend. He is disturbed and rowdy. \nHe's a bad drunk. He downs a shot and motions for another one. The BARTENDER comes over. \nBARTENDER You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are you sure you... \nSMECKER Pour the drink, faggot-ass! \nHe obeys. A good looking gay man comes up and whispers in Smecker's ear and points to the back room. \nSMECKER Okay... But I don't cuddle. \nThey proceed to the back. Smecker is stumbling. \nEXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH  EARLY MORNING \nRocco pulls Vincenzo's car to the curb and the MacManus' exit. \nROCCO Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit. \nMURPHY We have to go now.

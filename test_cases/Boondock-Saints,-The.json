{"test1_input": "ROZ You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck up! Leave him there. \nRozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to Murphy. \nMurphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands on her back. The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and stands above her. \nMURPHY Guess you'll have ta change that tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!? \nINT. HALLWAY  MACMANUS' TENEMENT APT  BUILDING  DAY \nThe brothers get to the top of the stairs. Connor is hunched over and moving slowly. Murphy giggles. \nCONNOR Fuck you. \nConnor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading doors at the end of the hall. The red brick buildings stretch down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy resting place, directly next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APARTMENT  EARLY EVENING \nThis is a decrepit, illegal loft. The boys enter, hang their rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes. \nConnor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of ice on his crotch. Murphy stands naked in the open quantity shower. Murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the stream. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING \nConnor, still seated, cracks open a Guinness and sips it lovingly. The phone rings. \nCONNOR Hello. \nMOM (V.O.) Connor, is that you? \nSomething is obviously wrong in her voice. \nCONNOR (interested) Mother, is that you? \nMOM (V.O.) Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this. \nCONNOR Ma, what's wrong? \nMurphy shuts off the water. \nMURPHY No fuckin' hot water man. That... \nCONNOR Shut it. It's Ma. \nMurphy sees the concern in Connor's eyes and takes a step closer. \nMOM (V.O.) It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for. \nCONNOR Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here. \nMurphy is drawing closer with concern. \nMURPHY What's the matter with her? \nINT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' HOUSE  IRELAND  NIGHT \nA wrinkly female hand grabs a large revolver resting next to a half empty bottle of Hennessey. \nMOM I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING \nCONNOR What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!? \nMURPHY (widening eyes) What the...? \nMOM (V.O.) I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now. \nCONNOR What?! What are you doin'? \nMOM (V.O.) I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger. \nCONNOR (screaming) Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here. \n", "test1_true": "MOM (V.O.) I... \nCONNOR No ma! No! \nMOM (V.O.) BLAME... \nCONNOR & MURPHY Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma! \nMOM (V.O.) YOU...! \nConnor and Murphy are both screaming in panic. \nEXT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' BACK STOOP  NIGHT \nMom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her hip. She holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and the gun directly next to it, in her right. She squeezes off a loud shot toward the heavens. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING \nAs soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver, Connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position. The bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across it. He throws the receiver and covers his ears with both hands. \nThe phone then falls to the ground, skipping through the cubes as the boys dive for it screaming. The two naked, hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their stomachs in the field of ice. They finally catch it and both put their ears to the receiver in panic. As they scream MA intermittently, the pauses get longer and longer. \nINT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' APARTMENT  NIGHT \nMom's got her hand covering her mouth, face red from holding back laughter, as she walks back into the house. She can take it no longer and she bursts out with hearty guffaws. \nINT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APARTMENT  EARLY EVENING \nThe boys are relieved, but angry. \nCONNOR (grabs his balls, rolls over) Aaaww, shit!... evil woman! \nMURPHY Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma. \nMOM (V.O.) Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No! \nMurphy holds the receiver in the air. Mom's still laughing. \nMURPHY (to Connor) Oh, she's quite proud of herself. \nMOM Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now. \nThey both put an ear to the phone. \nCONNOR All right, we're both here. \nMom pauses and cackles endlessly once again. \nMOM (finally) It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil. \nMURPHY Just called ta torture us did ya? \nCONNOR How's Uncle Sibeal? \nMOM Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us. \nThey all laugh. \nMOM But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl. \nMURPHY Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does. \nCONNOR Oh, Jesus. \nMURPHY I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today. \nCONNOR Don't even do it, ya bastard. \nMURPHY (laughs) He got beat up by a girl. \nCONNOR If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes. \nMOM (dogmatically) Lord's name. \n", "test1_id": 2385, "test2_input": "They jump into the air shaft. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nThey start crawling with Connor in front and Murphy behind. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThe plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living room. \nHis eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U- shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nConnor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is starting to look a bit confused. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThe fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming and pointing at each man. \nThey seem to be taking it seriously. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT \nTheir brows are drenched with sweat. Murphy crawls up next to Connor. There is only enough room for the two to lie on their sides facing each other. \nMURPHY Where the fuck are you going? \nCONNOR We'll find it. Just calm down. \nMURPHY No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds. \nMurphy takes off the rope. \nCONNOR We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole. \nMURPHY Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! \nCONNOR Sh, sh! Fuck you! \nConnor grabs Murphy's shirt. \nMURPHY No, fuck you! \nThe boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out. \nINT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT \nThey crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as they spin. Taking four shots apiece. \nThere are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted over the couch. \nThey notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in \na heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison. \nBOTH And shepherds we shall be. For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. So we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et Fili e spiritu sancti. \nWith the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with Latin script being read in the background. They take their rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle. \nCONNOR (looks up) That was some good fuckin' rope. \nThey both laugh. \nMURPHY That was way easier than I thought. \nCONNOR Aye. \nMURPHY On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch. \nCONNOR Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes. \nMURPHY Oh, we're good man. \n", "test2_true": "They are already striding for a suitcase full of money. \nMurphy picks up a wad of bills. \nMURPHY I love our new job. \nJust then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front of him. \nThey look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in. \nConnor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns right in his face. \nROCCO Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. (almost crying) They call me the funny fuckin' man! \nCONNOR (attempting to hide accent) Where's your gun? \nROCCO Chest pocket. (they take it) Shit! \nCONNOR This is a six-shooter. \nMURPHY (hiding accent) Nine bodies. \nCONNOR Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man? \nROCCO Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out. (trying to make friends) Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them? \nCONNOR Let's do him right here. \nMURPHY Right now. \nROCCO (screaming like a baby) Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny. \nThe boys put their faces close to his and demask. They start laughing but Rocco just lays there, wide-eyed, in shock. \nThey boys saunter to the bar. Rocco takes a long beat. \nROCCO What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!! \nCONNOR Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word. \nThe brothers laugh. \nROCCO What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS! \nCONNOR (slaps his face) Get a hold of yourself, man. \nRocco is silent and surprised. Murphy, also surprised, looks at Rocco. All is quiet. \nMURPHY Yeah, get a hold of yourself. \nMurphy jokingly slaps Rocco a second time. Rocco instantly jumps on Murphy, cursing and punching. The brothers burst into laughter as they subdue Rocco. As he calms down, they release him. \nCONNOR Listen, we gotta get outta here now. We'll take separate exits and meet at Rocco's. \nMurphy puts the two suitcases in his duffle bag and the two brush by Rocco who is still unsatisfied with his explanation. \nROCCO Fuck! \nBACK TO PRESENT  INT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NIGHT \nRocco has removed his hotel jacket. \nROCCO Anybody you think is evil? \nCONNOR Yes. \nROCCO Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? \nCONNOR Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison. \nMURPHY Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day. \nCONNOR Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers. \n", "test2_id": 2386, "test3_input": "INT.  YAKAVETTA'S FRONT FOYER  NIGHT \nThere is a knock at the door. Geno jumps with fright and then looks out the peep hole. He sees a well-formed pair of woman's breasts in a cheap dress. He opens the door. A stunning blonde stands before him. She looks like a hooker. \nShe wears a short, hot pink dress and a white scarf around her neck, as well as six inch platform heels. \nSMECKER AS WOMAN Joey Bevo sent me over. As entertainment. \nThe woman speaks and it is apparent that this is actually Smecker in drag. \nGENO Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night for this shit. (beat) Bevo's so great. Always sending us hot girls. \nSMECKER You look like you could use a quickie. \nSmecker kisses him full on the lips and rubs up against him. \nGeno is convinced. He brings her inside. \nGENO Hey, Chappy! \nCHAPPY (Chappy, emerges way down the hall) What the fuck? \nGENO I ain't been laid in a week. Take five minutes. \nCHAPPY If I die cause you're getting a piece of ass, I'll come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick. \nGENO Don't worry about it. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  NIGHT \nHe takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer. \nThey are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker uses a silencer, shoots him in the head. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  HALL  NIGHT \nHe starts to whisper, \"It's on now. It's on now. Too far.\" as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses. \nHe is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him. \nThe Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out. \nINT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT \nConnor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. \nHe rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. \nThe boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. \nHe stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks. \nINT.  CHEAP BOSTON HOTEL ROOM  NIGHT  3 MONTHS LATER \nBoth sleeping boys throw their arms out, mimicking a crucified Christ. Their father turns, sees this, turns back. \nThe boys wake with a start. Connor looks to his father, who is already staring at him. \nCONNOR How far are we going with this, Da? \nFATHER The questions is not, \"how far?\" The question is, \"Do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith to go as far as is needed?\" \nINT.  COURTHOUSE  BACK FOYER AREA  MORNING \nSmecker opens the door from the inside and lets the MacManus father and sons in. He walks one way they walk the other through the grand courthouse halls. \nINT.  COURTROOM  MORNING \nThe media, with their cameras and notebooks, are at the back of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He is cocky. The judge warns Yakavetta that he will have no more of this behavior in his courtroom. \nMEDIA MAN 1 (whispering to #2) Look at his charisma. He's the next John Gotti. \nMEDIA MAN 2 He'll walk. Even with all this evidence. \n", "test3_true": "MEDIA MAN 2 Look at him. He doesn't have a care in the world. He's gonna walk. \nINT.  FOYER TO COURTROOM  DAY \nThe MacManusus stand in the foyer. There are a pair of doors that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the inside courtroom. There is an armed guard directly inside the courtroom, in front of the doors. \nThe door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and drooling as the boys handcuff him. \nConnor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer. He locks them in with a padlock. \nFATHER How long do these put a man down for? \nMURPHY Ten minutes. \nThe father zaps the incapacitated man a second time as he lay. \nFATHER Twenty is a bit better. \nThey suit up, Connor and Murphy in their usual masks and gloves, Dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses. \nThe boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds them back. He takes a moment, then slowly removes his hat and glasses. His sons look at one another and then remove their masks. The three look into each others eyes for a moment. \nINT.  COURTROOM  DAY \nJUDGE Due to the lack of hard evidence...... \nThe three burst in, guns drawn, and are walking down the aisle. \nFATHER All media to the back! Drop the cameras! Drop 'em! \nTerrified, they all obey. Connor and Murphy pull Yakavetta from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the occupants of the courtroom. The father walks up and motions for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in protest, to come off the stand. \nAs soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the media stands in horror. He turns and walks back down the aisle. \nFATHER (loudly) You people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world. You will witness what happens here today and you will tell of it afterwards. \nAll eyes to the front. \nYAKAVETTA (looking to his comrades) Fuckin' do something! \nThe father keeps them covered. He passes the front, he looks and sees a VIRGINAL-LOOKING WOMAN with her head down crying into her hands. She is on the left side. He gently tilts her chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on the back of his hand. \nFATHER (WHISPERS) (whispers) You must watch dear. It'll all be over soon. (she obeys) \nThe father takes out a flask. He pours the booze on the judges bench and set it ablaze. Fire alarms start to sound. \nConnor and Murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. Murphy on the prosecution side, Connor on the defense. The father has his sawed-off to the back of Yakavetta's head. \nCONNOR (yelling over the alarm) Now, you will receive us. \nMURPHY (yelling over the alarm) We do not ask for your poor or your hungry. \nCONNOR We do not want your tired and sick. \nMURPHY It is your corrupt we claim. \nCONNOR It is your evil, who will be sought by us. \nMURPHY With every breath we shall hunt them down. \nCONNOR Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies. \nMURPHY Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace. \nCONNOR These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. (points to Yakavetta) \nMURPHY There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth (pointing to Yakavetta's people) Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain. \nCONNOR For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it. \nMURPHY And we will send you to whatever God you wish. \nConnor and Murphy jump off the table. They approach Yakavetta and stand on either side of their father. All three men hold guns to his head and recite the prayer. As they speak, the right side of the courtroom screams in protest. The left watches in wide-eyed terror, although some men encourage them to do it. The MacManus' read the prayer. They do not falter as the flames rage behind them. \n", "test3_id": 2387}

{"train": "WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S \nROMEO & JULIET \nAdapted by \nCraig Pearce & Baz Luhrmann \nShooting script \nOctober 6, 1995 \nEXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON. \nA ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold, headlights blazing, powers directly for us. \nCUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward the sedan. \nWIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing. \nTIGHT ON: The sedan. \nTIGHT ON: The pickup. \nLike thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a deafening cacophony of noise. \nINT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. \nTIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the disappearing sedan. \nGREGORY A dog of the house of Capulet moves me! \nHe and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON, explode with laughter. \nThe red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road. \nEXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON. \nThe truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy driveway of a large gas station. \nEXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. \nAttendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank. \nINT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. \nGregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously. \nGREGORY A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Capulets. \nSampson, sarcastically. \nSAMPSON That shows thee a weak slave. For the weakest goes to the wall. \nGREGORY 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore, I will push Capulet's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. \nBenvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car. \nBENVOLIO The quarrel is between our masters... \nGREGORY (yelling after him) ...and us their men. \nEXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. \nFOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom. \nPICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol. \nSUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart. \nThe front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots - decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other pairs of well-shod feet. \nHOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame. \nCRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO. \nAbra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad girls exit. \nFOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car. \nSUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the girls to: \nINT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON. \nSampson is trying to out boast Gregory. \nSAMPSON I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads. \nGregory; mock outrage. \nGREGORY The heads of the maids? \nSAMPSON I do bite my thumb, sir. \nINT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. \nCUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She motions her children to the floor. \nEXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. \nCustomers run for cover. \nCLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks: \nABRA Do you bite you thumb at us, sir? \nSAMPSON (sweating, murmurs to Gregory) Is the law on our side if I say \"Ay\"? \nGREGORY No. \nINT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON. \nCLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them. The sound of a toilet flushing. \nPAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio. \nEXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. \nCLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating. \nSAMPSON No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir - but I do bite my thumb, sir! \nCUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry. \nGREGORY Do you quarrel, sir? \nCUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile. \nABRA Quarrel sir, no sir. \nCLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado... \nSAMPSON But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you. \nCLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question. \nABRA No better? \nCLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped. \nSAMPSON Well sir... \nINT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON. \nCUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys. \nEXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON. \nCUT TO: Gregory's P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the bathroom - he whispers maniacally. \nGREGORY Here comes our kinsman. Say better! \nEXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams: \nSAMPSON \nYES SIR, BETTER! \nEXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars: \nABRA \nTHOU LIEST! \nCUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys. \nDISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks: \nABRA \nDRAW IF YOU BE MEN! \nLIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns. \nSLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams: \nBENVOLIO Part, fools! You know not what you do! \nMUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads: \n'Sword 9mm series S' \nCUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation: \nCAROLINE Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe! \nMONTAGUE (shrugging her off) Hold me not, let me go! \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nCrouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load. \nCLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and presses into Benvolio's forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly. \nTYBALT Look upon thy death, Benvolio. \nCLOSE ON: Tybalt's finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror. \nSUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him. A command booms from the chopper's public address system. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE (over PA) Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground. \nINT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone and repeats the command. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground! \nEXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT. \nTybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a halt. \nAn almighty orchestral chord. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT. \nSUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket. \nIn the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET. \nWe hear: \nVOICE OVER Two households, both alike in dignity. In fair Verona, where we lay our \nSCENE From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life. Whose misadventured piteous \nOVERTHROWS Doth with their death bury their parents strife. \nA dark chord. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH SKYLINE. NIGHT. \nA swarm of helicopters thunder into frame. We see compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey. \nSLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the emblem reads; \"Verona Beach Police Department: In God We Trust\". \nHOLD: \nINT. CAPTAIN PRINCE'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Captain Prince's grim features. He eyes Capulet and Montague. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Three civil brawls, bred of an airy \nWORD By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets. \nCapulet's lawyer tries to intervene. \nLAWYER My noble Prince I can... \nCaptain Prince overriding, slams the desk. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. \nHold on Captain Prince's determined gaze. \nEXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN. \nA majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the now peaceful city. \nINT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. \nTed Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence. \nCaroline finally speaks her anger. \nCAROLINE O where is Romeo? Saw you him today? (pointedly to Montague) Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \nMontague snorts derisively and stares out the window. Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance. \nBENVOLIO Madam, underneath The Grove of \nSYCAMORE So early walking did I see your son. \nTed Montague speaks with contempt. \nROMEO (CONT.) What fray was here? \nBenvolio starts to reply. \nROMEO (CONT.) \n(ANGRILY) Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. \nRomeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides along the sidewalk raging. \nROMEO (CONT.) Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness, serious vanity, Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! \nRomeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway of a sex club. \nROMEO (CONT.) This love feel I, that feel no love in this! \nThe bouncer's hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him, turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears: \nROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not laugh? \nBenvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out of danger. \nBENVOLIO No, coz, I rather weep. \nRomeo smiles. \nROMEO Farewell, my coz. \nRomeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio pursues him down the street. \nEXT. ROMEO'S CAR. DAY. \nCLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy - \nBALTHASAR. \nPULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent silver car. \nThree or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the already gleaming car. \nBalthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car door for Romeo. \nBenvolio intercepts Romeo at the car. \nBENVOLIO Tell me in sadness, who is it that you love. \nROMEO In sadness, cousin, I do love...a woman. \nBENVOLIO I aimed so near when I supposed you loved. \nRomeo leans against the car. \nROMEO A right good marksman; and she's fair I love. \nRomeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo. \nCLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE. \nBENVOLIO Rosaline! (he is impressed) A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. \nROMEO She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit, And in strong proof of chastity lives well armed. \nBenvolio can't believe it. \nBENVOLIO Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? \nROMEO She hath; and in that sparing makes huge waste. \nBenvolio - a plan. \nBENVOLIO Be ruled by me; forget to think of her. \nROMEO O, teach me how I should forget to think! \nBenvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting the foot path. \nBENVOLIO By giving liberty unto thine eyes. Examine other beauties. \nRomeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back. \nROMEO Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. \nBENVOLIO I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. \nBenvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle. \nINT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY. \nAn orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the word MONTAGUE. \nCAPULET But Montague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike; \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. \nAs the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle. \nSuddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes. \nThe Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar. \nConfused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips. \nRomeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face snaps abruptly away. \nINT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. \nCUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world. \nJuliet warily moves closer to the glass. \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. \nRomeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad builds. \nSLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and... \nINT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. \n...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank. \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. \nRomeo presses his nose lightly against the glass. \nINT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT. \nJuliet; a tiny smile. \nSuddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns, startled. It is the Nurse. \nNURSE Juliet, your mother calls. \nThe Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy. \nINT. BALLROOM. NIGHT. \nRomeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd. \nCUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone. \nJuliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor. \nDave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet. \nDAVE Will you now deny to dance? \nJuliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor. \nGLORIA (whispering to Juliet) A man, young lady, such a man. \nAs Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy. \nCUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness. \nHOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon. \nTYBALT What, dares the slave come hither to fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honor of my \nKIN To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. \nTybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet slams a hand into his chest. \nCAPULET Why how now kinsman, wherefore storm you so? \nTYBALT Uncle, this is that villain Romeo. A Montague, our foe. \nCapulet peers across the ballroom. \nCAPULET Young Romeo is it? \nTYBALT 'Tis he. \nCAPULET Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him. \nTybalt can't believe it. \nTYBALT I'll not endure him. \nCLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage. \nCAPULET He shall be endured! (slapping Tybalt viciously) What, goodman boy! I say he shall! Go to. \nCapulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground. \nSuddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely. \nNURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. \nWe see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty. \nNURSE (CONT.) Come, let's away. \nShe takes firm control of her charge. \nJuliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room. \nCUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris. \nInaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo. \nCUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure. \nCUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'. \nCUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation. \nROMEO (under his breath) Is she a Capulet? \nCUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back. \nCUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is. \nCUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear. \nNURSE His name is Romeo, and a Montague, The only son of your great enemy. \nAn orchestral treatment of Joy Division's \"Love will tear us Apart\" swells; \nHOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a dark coldness descends upon her. \nCUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo. \nMERCUTIO Away, begone, the sport is at its best. \nMercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door. \nROMEO Ay so I fear, \nA covert glance over his shoulder. \nROMEO (CONT.) The more is my unrest. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. \nMercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the stairs to the waiting getaway car. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT. \nCUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT. \nCUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos. \nA huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words \"CAPULET.\" \nAs the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant sparkles light in her eyes. \nPUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper: \nJULIET My only love, sprung from my only hate. Too early seen unknown, and known too late. Prodigious birth of love it is to me \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT. \nCUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the falling curtain of fiery embers. \nJULIET (CONT.)(V/O) That I must love a loathed enemy. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT. \nWarm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass. \nCRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind. \nTYBALT I will withdraw. But this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall. \nINT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT. \nCaught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio. \nBOYS \"I am a pretty piece of flesh, I am a pretty piece of flesh...\" \nRomeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns, toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER. NIGHT. \nUnderwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of arms, legs and bodies. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT. \nCUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves toward the pool area. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT. \nCUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get distance from her attacker. \nJULIET What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel? \nRomeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water. \nROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to \nMYSELF Because it is an enemy to thee. The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water. \nCUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool area. \nGUARD'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water. \nCUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish. \nCUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns the way he came. \nCUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile. \nJULIET Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? \nROMEO Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. \nJuliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo toward a small grotto at the end of the pool. \nJULIET How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and whyfore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art. \nROMEO (with splashy bravado) With love's light wings did I o'er perch these walls. For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. \nJuliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto. \nJULIET (a real fear) If they do see thee, they will murder thee. \nRomeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him. \nROMEO I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their \nHATE Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. \nThe lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly fearful, pushes Romeo away. \nJULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form - fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? \nRomeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him. \nJULIET (CONT.) I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. \nROMEO Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops - \nJULIET O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. \nROMEO What shall I swear by? \nJULIET Do not swear at all. Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee. \nShe touches his cheek. Romeo moves his lips close. \nROMEO If my heart's dear love - \nConfused, Juliet breaks away. \nJULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too \nSUDDEN; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'it lightens.' Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. \nShe rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately. \nROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? \nJuliet - a shocked look. \nJULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? \nCLOSE ON: Romeo. \nROMEO The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo. \nA feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie. \nROMEO (O/S) Good morrow, father! \nFather Laurence snaps off the television and exits the workroom. \nEXT. WALL. DAWN. \nRomeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately on a wooden door set into a high stone wall. \nROMEO Good morrow, father! \nEXT. COURTYARD. DAWN. \nFrom the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo bursts in. \nFATHER LAURENCE Benedicite! What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? \nWithout pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard and toward the church. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Young son, it argues a distempered \nHEAD So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed. Or if not so, then here I hit it right - Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight. \nThe priest enters the back of the church. \nINT. SACRISTY. DAWN. \nRomeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest into the sacristy. \nROMEO The last is true. The sweeter rest was mine. \nFATHER LAURENCE (he stops) God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline? \nROMEO With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No. I have forgot that name and that name's woe. \nThe Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray for mass. \nFATHER LAURENCE That's my good son! But where hast thou been then? \nUnconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear he knows the routine by heart. \nROMEO I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me. That's by me wounded. Both our \nREMEDIES Within they help and holy physic lies. \nFATHER LAURENCE (buttoning a long black cassock) Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift. Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. \nROMEO Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set, On the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow, I'll tell thee as we pass. But this I pray, That thou consent to marry us today. \nCUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter. \nALTAR BOYS Good morrow, Romeo. \nThe apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the message and bolt. \nFATHER LAURENCE Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon foresaken? Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. \nROMEO Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. \nFATHER LAURENCE (very angry) For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. \nROMEO I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow. The other did not so. \nFATHER LAURENCE O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. \nThe Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of hymns. \nCHOIR How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold, Maybe I'm just too demanding, Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold, Maybe you're just like my mother, She's never satisfied. Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry... \nWe recognise the hymn as \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince. \nPUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo. \nFATHER LAURENCE But come, young waverer, come, go with me. In one respect I'll thy assistant be. For this alliance may so happy \nPROVE To turn your households' rancor to pure love. \nRomeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments. \nROMEO O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste. \nFather Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze. \nFATHER LAURENCE Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast. \nThe procession is joined by the two little altar boys and the mass begins. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. \nAs the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand, green sea and blue sky. \nMercutio, evading, heads for shore. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou... \nEXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY. \nRomeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls suddenly serious. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) \n(QUIETLY) What thou art, by art as well as by nature. \nA moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them. Romeo looks up. \nROMEO Here's goodly gear. \nStanding above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a ridiculous, all red, \"Jackie O\" style disguise of sunglasses, scarf and parasol. \nMERCUTIO \n(BEMUSED) God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman. \nThe nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo. \nNURSE I desire some confidence with you. \nShe turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the chauffer waits beside the limousine. \nBenvolio and the other boys look on curiously. \nMERCUTIO A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! \nBut Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to Benvolio, who shrugs. \nBENVOLIO She will endite him to some supper? \nEven more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine. \nMERCUTIO (taken by surprise) Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither. \nROMEO (as he closes the door) I will follow you. \nMERCUTIO Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell. \nThe car pulls away. \nEXT. STREET. DAY. \nThe limousine drives through Verona Beach. \nINT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY. \nCLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks in cold deadly earnest. \nNURSE If ye should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing. \nBEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully. \nROMEO Bid her to come to confession this afternoon, And there she shall at Friar Laurence's cell Be shrived and (PUSH IN ON: Romeo) married. \nINT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window. \nJULIET O God she comes! \nEXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY. \nPULL BACK: JULIET'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the front door, the Nurse alights. \nJuliet bolts from the room. \nINT. LANDING. DAY. \nJuliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead, disappears into a doorway. \nINT. STAIRWAY. DAY. \nJuliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels of the house. \nINT. KITCHEN. DAY. \nThe kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying, beauty. \nJuliet bursts breathlessly into the room. \nJULIET O honey nurse, what news? \nThe Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the refrigerator, does not turn around. \nJuliet cries impatiently. \nJULIET Good afternoon to my ghostly confessor. \nBut before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately. \nFATHER LAURENCE \n(DRYLY) Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. \nThe choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple. \nThe choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Come, come, and we will make short work. For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. \nA young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He launches into a wailing solo. \nMACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring. Engraved on the inside of the band are the words 'I love thee.' \nPULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet's finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage. \nINT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nCRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nThe music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss. \nPeter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car. \nAs the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside. \nHOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away. \nEXT. UNDERWATER. DAY. \nFISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the water. \nA muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. \nWe see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to the beach - is hunting fish. \nBenvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower. \nA shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds. \nBENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire. The day is hot, \nMercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot. \nBENVOLIO (CONT.) The Capels are abroad. And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl. \nMercutio strides out of the water. \nMERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee!' (he hands Benvolio his gun) and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. \nAnother incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple. \nThe joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang. \nSuddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot. \nBENVOLIO By my head, here comes the Capulets. \nMERCUTIO By my heel, I care not. \nEXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. \nThe sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from Benvolio and Mercutio. \nTybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio. \nTYBALT Gentlemen, good day. A word with one of you. \nThe boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge - eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns. \nMercutio smiles mockingly. \nMERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a... \nLeaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) ...blow. \nMercutio scores. The boys laugh. \nTYBALT \n(FURIOUS) You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, (clutching at his side arm) And you will give me occasion. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Tybalt, you ratcatcher, \n...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Will you walk? \nTybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood. \nTYBALT What wouldst thou have with me? \nHe swipes at Mercutio. \nMERCUTIO \n(AVOIDING) Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. \nMercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps. \nTYBALT I am for you. \nTybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head. Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away. \nUnarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio, slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of glass. \nLightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them. \nROMEO Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio! \nSeizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach. A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence, sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at Tybalt. \nABRA Away Tybalt! \nThey bolt for their vehicle. \nBenvolio goes to Mercutio. \nBENVOLIO Art thou hurt? \nBut Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs. \nMERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch. \nHe turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs. With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the conqueror. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) A scratch! \nThe boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio down the stairs. \nROMEO Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much. \nMercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain. \nMERCUTIO 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. \nHe turns the next thought to the assembled audience. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) (through crazy laughter) A plague o' both your houses! \nMercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is struggling to support his weight. \nMercutio - through weak and desperate breathing. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes. \nROMEO I thought all for the best. \nLike an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap, Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if falling in the dark: \nMERCUTIO A plague o' both your houses! They have made worms' meat of me. \nMercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt. Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling through the chilling cold. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) (a silent whisper) Your houses! \nEverything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm finally breaks. \nEXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY. \nTiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle Mercutio's lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain. Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of Benvolio whispering: \nBENVOLIO Mercutio is dead! \nTears streak Romeo's face. He cries out. \nROMEO Oh sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor's steel! \nThe sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage. \nShrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo runs to his car. \nEXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. \nEXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON. \nAway, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour. \nTHE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt. \nShe cries: \nGLORIA Tybalt! \nCops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on. \nGLORIA (CONT.) Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child! O, the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman. \nPolice lines part as Captain Prince arrives. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray? \nBenvolio struggles forward. \nBENVOLIO O noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. \nGloria appeals hysterically: \nGLORIA Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague! \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? \nBENVOLIO (pointing to Tybalt's corpse) There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio. \nGloria interjects savagely. \nGLORIA He speaks not true! Affection makes him false! \nBENVOLIO Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of \nTYBALT Deaf to peace! \nGLORIA He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live! \nCaptain Prince turns to Gloria. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? \nTed Montague pleads: \nMONTAGUE Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt. \nCaptain Prince eyes Montague coldly. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him. \nMontague, body guards in tow, surges forward. \nMONTAGUE Noble Prince...? \nPrince silences him. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE I will be deaf to pleading and \nEXCUSES; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. \nThe Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last. \nCLOSE ON: Captain Prince. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. \nINT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON. \nAn acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart.' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm. \nJULIET Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a \nLOVE But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new \nROBES And may not wear them. \nEXT. CAPULET'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON. \nJuliet's P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway. \nPULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the room. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. \nThrough the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs. \nThe music surges. \nThe priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint for the car. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT. \nSobs echo through the house. \nDave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge bunch of flowers. \nFulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand. \nCUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet. \nGLORIA She'll not come down tonight. \nDave, an understanding smile. \nDAVE These times of woe afford no times to woo. \nCapulet guides Dave into the house. \nCAPULET Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly. \nGLORIA \n(JOINING) And so did I. \nCAPULET (a cold glance at Gloria) Well, we were born to die. \nCapulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to Dave. \nGLORIA I'll know her mind early tomorrow. Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness. \nAs Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door. \nINT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet's face. Tears stream onto the pillow. Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet's eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her. \nA still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes. \nJuliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto the bed. \nINT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT. \nCapulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken excitement. \nCAPULET We'll keep no great ado - a friend or two. For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman if we revel much - But soft what day is this? \nDAVE Monday my lord. \nCAPULET Well Wednesday is too soon - what say you to Thursday? \nGloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned. \nDAVE My lord I... \nCAPULET (leaning close) I will make a desperate tender of my child's love. (a drunken good humour) I think she will be ruled in all respects by me; (exploding with hearty laughter) Nay, more, I doubt it not! \nCUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens. \nCAPULET (to Dave) But what say you to Thursday? \nDave is trying to catch up. \nDAVE My lord I... \nCUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently. \nDAVE (CONT.) I would that Thursday were tomorrow. \nDelighted, Capulet jumps to his feet. \nCAPULET A Thursday let it be then! \nCapulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise. \nCAPULET Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed. Tell her, a Thursday she shall be \nMARRIED To this noble sir! \nCLOSE ON: The glasses clink. \nEXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN. \nA pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion. \nINT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN. \nA tangle of young limbs. \nRomeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps into the room. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses her cheek. \nDAVE (CONT.) Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. \nDave leaves. \nTRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy. \nThe priest follows. \nINT. SACRISTY. DAY. \nJuliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the small room. \nThe priest goes to her. \nFATHER LAURENCE O Juliet, I already know thy grief. \nJuliet pulls away. \nJULIET Tell me not, Father, that thou hearest of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it. \nFATHER LAURENCE It strains me past the compass of my wits. \nJULIET \n(DESPERATELY) If in thy wisdom thou canst give no \nHELP Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently! \nShe pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself. \nHorrified, Father Laurence moves to her. \nJuliet, panicked, levels the gun at him. \nFATHER LAURENCE Hold daughter! \nJULIET (through tears) Be not so long to speak. I lone to die! \nFather Laurence holds out a soothing hand. \nFATHER LAURENCE I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an \nEXECUTION As that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt \nUNDERTAKE A thing like death... \nWe hear the distended chords of Faur\u00e9's Requiem. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) to chide away this shame... \nIt continues throughout as; \nThe entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue liquid. \nReflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father Laurence. \nThe face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into a clear water solution. \nLike a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a cobalt hue. \nINT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY. \nPULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by Father Laurence. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest. Each part, deprived of supple government, Shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the \nMORNING Comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou, dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, And hither shall he come. And that very Night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. \nThe priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Take thou this vial, being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord with speed to Mantua. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nAs Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express envelope addressed \"Romeo - Mantua.\" The envelope pulls away from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with hundreds of like envelopes. \nTRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into the back of an express delivery van. \nHeavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the slogan 'Speed Express.' \nThe van pulls away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MANTUA. DAY. \nA burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged wasteland. \nCRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the distance. \nMEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO) Mortal drugs? \nMEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO) Of lethal quantity as 'twould render death. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY. \nThey enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked with wedding decorations. \nCapulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background Gloria stares vacantly. \nMoving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY. \nThe door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it. \nFATHER LAURENCE (to the man in black) As the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church. \nWhen the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker. \nUNDERTAKER She shall be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. \nINT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY. \nA thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension.' \nPAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet mausoleum. \nOn view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet's peaceful body. \nWe move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows of the front door a young man hides. \nCLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar. \nPUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum. \nEXT. MANTUA. DAY. \nWe are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway. \nAs a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo's voice over: \nROMEO (V/O) If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand... \nCRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office. The driver alights and goes inside. \nINT. TRAILER. DAY. \nRomeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook. The \"WE CALLED\" card lies next to an overflowing ashtray. \nHis voice over continues. \nROMEO (V/O) And all this day an unaccustomed \nSPIRIT Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me \nDEAD And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself \nPOSSESSED When but love's shadows are so rich in joy. \nStubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park. \nROMEO News from Verona! \nAn excited Romeo rushes from the trailer. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY. \nCRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept Balthasar's car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps out. \nRomeo yells joyously. \nROMEO How now, Balthasar? \nBathlasar cannot speak. \nROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How doth my lady Juliet? That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well. \nBalthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell. He looks away. \nBALTHASAR Then she is well and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault. \nFor a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm. \nROMEO Is it e'en so? \nBalthasar nods. \nRomeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland. \nCLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination. \nFather Laurence is worried. \nFATHER LAURENCE By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune! The letter was of dear import. (PAUSE: the priest listens) Adieu. \nHe hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Now must I to the monument alone. Within this hour will fair Juliet awake. \nDISSOLVE FROM: The clock to... \nINT. APOTHECARY'S APARTMENT. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table. \nPULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism. \nAPOTHECARY Drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight. \nRomeo takes the vial and hands over the money. \nROMEO There is my gold - worse poison to men's souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. \nINT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT. \nMotor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to a halt. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. \nRomeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight catches his face. The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet. \nINT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: The cop. \nCOP This is that banished haughty Montague. \nINT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. \nBalthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches forward. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. \nTires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of Balthasar's moving vehicle. \nSiren blaring, the police car gives chase. \nAERIAL SHOT. NIGHT. \nBalthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car gaining. \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT. \nA police car U-turns over a median strip. \nEXT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT. \nTIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood. \nThe tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the speeding car through city traffic. \nCRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast. \nINT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. \nCaptain Prince barrels through the corridors of police headquarters pulling on his flying jacket. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT. \nTIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt. \nBalthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus. \nWHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare. \nCUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking to avoid collision. \nMiraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path and onto the other side of the roadway. \nThe sedan slams into the following patrol car. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT. \nBalthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach Eternal Rest Cemetery. \nINT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. \nCaptain Prince scans the night time city below. He speaks to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply. \nEXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky. \nINT. PRIEST'S CAR. NIGHT. \nOrange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police vehicle. \nFather Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration. \nFATHER LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed tonight! \nAcross the road Police swarm around the entrance to the cemetery. \nFATHER LAURENCE Fear comes upon me. O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing. \nHOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds pulse away. \nINT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. \nTRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames. \nDISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel. \nThe chapel is dark. \nAs Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets. \nRomeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death. \nRomeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her. \nROMEO O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there. \nRomeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers. \nROMEO (CONT.) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial \nDEATH Is amorous and keeps thee here in \nDARK To be his paramour? For fear of \nTHAT I still will stay with thee. Here, oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious \nSTARS From this world-wearied flesh. \nHe lays himself close. \nROMEO (CONT.) Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss... \nGently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly, Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice. \nROMEO (CONT.) A dateless bargain to engrossing death. \nRomeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet. \nROMEO (CONT.) (fighting for breath) O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. \nBehind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo. \nJULIET Oh Romeo, what's here? \nForcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips. \nJuliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip from her eyes. \nJULIET (CONT.) Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on \nTHEM To make me die with a restorative. \nShe delicately kisses Romeo's lips. \nJULIET (CONT.) (a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm. \nDesperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers: \nROMEO Thus with a kiss I die. \nThere is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her. \nJULIET Romeo. O' my true love Romeo. \nShe looks to the gun in his hand. \nEXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT. \nTRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car. \nTwo police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them. \nDiscover Father Laurence arriving. \nCUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum. \nHe sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to him. \n", "test1_input": "CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo. \nBENVOLIO At this same ancient feast of \nCAPULET'S Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou so loves, With all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and with unattained eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. \nROMEO One fairer than my love? \nCrusty returns. He hands the boys their guns. \nROMEO (CONT.) The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. \nCUT TO: TELEVISION. \nSUSAN If you be not of the house of Montagues, Come and crush a cup of wine! \nRICH Rest you merry! \nCUT TO: Romeo, he considers. \nROMEO I'll go along, no such sight to be shown. But to rejoice in splendour of mine own. \nThe boys move off. \nPUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION. \nEXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY. \nAn aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the grounds. The telecaption reads \"Capulet Mansion.\" \nThe file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations for tonight's celebrations, and into the house. The music darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name. \nVOICE OVER \nJ U L I E T ! \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - CORRIDOR. DAY. \nCUT TO: A long deserted corridor. \nVOICE OVER \nJ U L I E T ! \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - DRAWING ROOM. DAY. \nCUT TO: An echoey Chinoiserie style drawing room. \nVOICE OVER \nJ U L I E T ! \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY. \nCLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water. \nWe hear, though faintly, the calling: \nVOICE OVER \nJ U L I E T ! \nWith a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise that she is in fact, in a bath. \nWe hear the calling loudly again. \nVOICE OVER \nJ U L I E T ! \nJuliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the water. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY. \nA Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and servants preparing for tonight's party. \nGloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume. \nDissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and calls maniacally. \nGLORIA \nJ U L I E T ! \nGloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic woman. \nGLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me. \nNURSE I bade her come. God forbid! Where's this girl? Juliet! \nCUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet. \n", "test1_true": "(COOLLY) Madam, I am here. What is you will. \nGloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her daughter toward a doorway. \nGLORIA Nurse, give leave awhile, we must talk in secret. \nINT. GLORIA'S DRESSING ROOM. DAY. \nGloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and closes the door. She circles with nervous vexation searching for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out to the Nurse. \nGLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, come back again. I have remembered me, thou's hear our counsel. \nThe Nurse enters. Gloria, still refusing eye contact, checks her appearance once more in the mirror. She takes a hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her hair. \nGLORIA (CONT.) Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age. \nNURSE (to Juliet) Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed. \nThe hair brush clatters onto the dresser. A moment of tense silence. Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry. \nBack still turned, she speaks to her daughter. \nGLORIA By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. \nA nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria's mouth. She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face Juliet. \nGLORIA (CONT.) Thus then in brief, the valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \nCUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare. \nThe Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation. \nNURSE A man, young lady! Lady, such a \nMAN As all the world - why, he's a man of wax. \nThe medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria. She joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris's favour. \nGLORIA Verona's summer hath not such a flower. \nNURSE Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. \nGLORIA This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen. This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him only lacks a cover. So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less. \nGloria probes Juliet's thoughts. \nGLORIA Can you like of Paris' love? \nJuliet, adept at negotiating her mother's strange moods, chooses her words precisely. \nJULIET I'll look to like, if looking liking move, But no more deep will I endart mine eye, Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. \nPETER the chauffeur enters. \nPETER Madam. The guests are come. \nGLORIA (checks the mirror) We follow thee. \nShe exits, Nurse in tow. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water. \nSuddenly the Nurse's face leers into shot. She whispers enthusiastically into Juliet's ear. \nNURSE Go girl, seek happy nights to happy days. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet's face. \nEXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT. \nJUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink against the inky sky. \nEXT. BEACH. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with fake chain mail and sword. \nRomeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke. \nBehind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle. \nSuddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt. \nCLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt. \nCUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement. \nCUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans. \nPAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO. \nCUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously. \n", "test1_id": 3087, "test2_input": "CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music. \nMERCUTIO Strike drum! \nMercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys. \nAggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares: \nMERCUTIO We'll on without apology. \nRomeo lets the invitation fall to the sand. \nROMEO I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I will bear the light. \nRomeo pulls on the bong once more. \nSuddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand. \nMERCUTIO Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. \nRomeo pushes Mercutio away. \nROMEO Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead. \nMercutio in mock sympathy. \nMERCUTIO Too great oppression for a tender thing. \nROMEO Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. \nRomeo lies staring up at the stars. \nMERCUTIO If love be rough with you, be rough with love. \nMercutio jumps on Romeo. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. \nRomeo fights Mercutio off. \nROMEO Under love's heavy burden do I sink! \nCUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn. \nBENVOLIO Every man betake him to his legs! \nMercutio heads Romeo toward the car. \nMERCUTIO Come, we burn daylight, ho! \nRomeo pulls away. \nROMEO But 'tis no wit to go. \nMercutio turns, exasperated. \nMERCUTIO Why, may one ask? \nROMEO I dreamt a dream tonight. \nMERCUTIO And so did I. \nROMEO Well, what was yours? \nMERCUTIO That dreamers often lie. \nROMEO In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \nMercutio produces a tiny gold pill case. \nMERCUTIO O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate \nSTONE On the forefinger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep. \nTantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat. \nWith a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray pill. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; \nHe palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo's ear. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. \nThe pill box glints in the moonlight. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck; And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. \nMercutio now intensely angry: \n", "test2_true": "He screams into the night. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage. This is she, this is she... \nCLOSE ON: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a strange stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend. \nROMEO Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace. Thou talkest of nothing. \nMercutio meets Romeo's gaze. \nMERCUTIO True, I talk of dreams; Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the \nNORTH And, being angered, puffs away from \nTHENCE Turning his attention to the dew- dropping south. \nCUT TO: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught up with him and he looks a little queasy. \nBENVOLIO This wind you talk of blows us from \nOURSELVES: Supper is done and we shall come too late. \nRomeo looks toward the distant city. \nROMEO I fear, too early, for my mind \nMISGIVES Some consequence yet hanging in the \nSTARS Shall bitterly begin his fearful \nDATE With this night's revels, and expire the term Of a despised life closed in my breast, By some vile forfeit of untimely death. \nPAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across the bay. Romeo smiles. \nROMEO (CONT.) But he that hath the steerage of my \nCOURSE Direct my sail! \nHe takes the pill and drops it into his mouth. \nROMEO (CONT.) On, lusty gentlemen! \nWith the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch into Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar by Ravi Shankar. \nEXT. MERCUTIO'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT. \nPULL OUT: From Romeo's eyes. He is lying in the passenger seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire. \nINT. CAPULET'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT. \nPULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band. The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio. \nCUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor. \nCUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction. \nMERCUTIO Everyman betake him to his legs! \nRomeo moves off through the crowd. \nCUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp. \nSuddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck. \nDISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's. \nCAPULET Ah, I have seen the day that I \nCOULD Tell a whispering tale in a fair ladies ear. Such as would please. \nCapulet screams above the music: \nCAPULET (CONT.) Come musicians play! \nBlood drums in Romeo's ears. Breaking free from Capulet's grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. \nSilent, underwater shot. Romeo's tranquil features submerged in a basin of water. \nBEAT. \nWith a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms. Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror. He turns: \nThe entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank. \nRomeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers. \nINT. BALLROOM. NIGHT. \nAs the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad. \n", "test2_id": 3088, "test3_input": "FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back. \nGloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward Romeo as he silently mouths: \nROMEO Adieu, adieu! \nAs Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers a little prayer to herself. \nJULIET O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle, Fortune, Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back. \nINT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN. \nJuliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother. Gloria turns to her. \nGLORIA Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor I looked not for. \nJuliet plays along. \nJULIET Madam, in happy time. What day is that? \nGloria takes a deep breath. \nGLORIA Marry, my child, early next Thursday \nMORN The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak. \nJULIET Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride! \nFear passes across Gloria's face. \nGLORIA Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself. \nCapulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the room. \nCAPULET How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? \nGLORIA Ay, sir. But she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave! \nCapulet - a dangerous calm. \nCAPULET How? Will she none? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have \nWROUGHT So worthy a gentleman to be her bride? \nJULIET Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate. \nPAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then - \nBAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it into a thousand pieces. \nCAPULET Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next ... \nCapulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the hallway. \nJULIET Hear me with patience but to speak a word... \nINT. LANDING. DAY. \nThe Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and shakes her like a rag doll. \nCAPULET Speak not, reply not, do not answer me! \nHe throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into her face. \nGLORIA \n(SCREAMING) Fie, fie! What are you mad? \nGloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her, sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he advances on his cowering daughter. \nCAPULET Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch. \nThe Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet. \nNURSE God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. \nFurious, Capulet shunts her aside. \nCAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool! \nCapulet yanks his daughter's face close to his. \nCAPULET (CONT.) I tell thee what - get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face. And you be mine, I'll give you to my friend. And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn. \nCapulet storms off down the hall. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the stairs. \nJULIET O sweet my mother, cast me not away! Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not, make the bridal \n", "test3_true": "A trickle of blood issues from Gloria's cut lip. She checks her appearance in the hall mirror. \nGLORIA Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. \nGloria leaves. \nJULIET O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? \nThe Nurse doesn't reply. \nJULIET (CONT.) What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. \nA heavy silence. \nThe Nurse goes to Juliet. \nNURSE Faith, here it is. I think it best you married with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman! I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not, Your first is dead - or 'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him. \nJuliet is very still. \nJULIET Speakest thou from thy heart? \nNURSE And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both. \nJULIET Amen. \nNURSE \n(UNSURE) What? \nJuliet is matter of fact. \nJULIET Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Friar Laurence, To make confession and to be absolved. \nThe old woman nods. She strokes Juliet's hair. \nNURSE This is wisely done. \nJuliet does not look up. \nA disturbing choral chant: \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHURCH. DAY. \nSunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister underscoring. We hear Dave Paris' voice: \nDAVE (O/S) Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death... \nCRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the front of the church. \nDAVE (CONT.) ...Now, sir, her father counts it \nDANGEROUS That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our \nMARRIAGE To stop the inundation of her tears... \nFather Laurence turns. Juliet stands framed in the white glare of the doorway. \nDave smiles. \nDAVE Happily met, my lady and my wife. \nCLOSE ON: Juliet's hand concealed beneath her coat - we can just see the handle of a gun. \nJuliet advances slowly, an icy calm: \nJULIET That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. \nDAVE That 'may be', must be, love, on Thursday next. \nJuliet stares past Dave. \nJULIET What must be, shall be. \nFather Laurence, a forced cheerfulness. \nFATHER LAURENCE That's a certain text. \nDAVE Come you to make confession? \nJuliet forces a smile. \nJULIET Are you at leisure, holy father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass? \nFATHER LAURENCE My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. (to Dave) We must entreat the time alone. \nDAVE God shield I should disturb devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye; \nDave bends. \n", "test3_id": 3089}

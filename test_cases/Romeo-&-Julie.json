NIGHT. \nCrouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load. \nCLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and presses into Benvolio's forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly. \nTYBALT Look upon thy death, Benvolio. \nCLOSE ON: Tybalt's finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams a scream of mortal horror. \nSUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him. A command booms from the chopper's public address system. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE (over PA) Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground. \nINT. CHOPPER. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone and repeats the command. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground! \nEXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT. \nTybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a halt. \nAn almighty orchestral chord. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT. \nSUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket. \nIn the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET. \nWe hear: \nVOICE OVER Two households, both alike in dignity. In fair Verona, where we lay our \nSCENE From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life.

We see compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey. \nSLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the emblem reads; \"Verona Beach Police Department: In God We Trust\". \nHOLD: \nINT. CAPTAIN PRINCE'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Captain Prince's grim features. He eyes Capulet and Montague. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE Three civil brawls, bred of an airy \nWORD By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets. \nCapulet's lawyer tries to intervene. \nLAWYER My noble Prince I can... \nCaptain Prince overriding, slams the desk. \nCAPTAIN PRINCE If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. \nHold on Captain Prince's determined gaze. \nEXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN. \nA majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the now peaceful city. \nINT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. \nTed Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in uncomfortable silence. \nCaroline finally speaks her anger. \nCAROLINE O where is Romeo? Saw you him today? (pointedly to Montague) Right glad I am he was not at this fray. \nMontague snorts derisively and stares out the window. Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance. \nBENVOLIO Madam, underneath The Grove of \nSYCAMORE So early walking did I see your son. \nTed Montague speaks with contempt. \n", "test1_true": "SEEN With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew. \nCaroline struggles to contain her emotion. \nCAROLINE Away from light steals home my heavy son And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night. \nMontague barks into the car intercom. \nMONTAGUE Westward from this city side. \nEXT. STREET. DAWN. \nThe limousine U-turns heading west. \nEXT. BEACH. DAWN. \nTo the melancholic strains of Mozart's \"Serenade for Winds\", we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an empty beach. \nCLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean he sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely in a small worn note book. \nWe hear his voice over. \nROMEO (V/O) Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; Being vexed, a sea nourished with lovers' tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall and a preserving sweet. \nINT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. \nThe limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the beach. \nOpposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub. A broken neon sign reads: \"The Grove of Sick Amore.\" \nTed, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of Romeo on the beach. \nMONTAGUE Black and portentous must this humour prove Unless good counsel may the cause remove. \nEXT. BEACH. DAWN. \nP.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front. \nINT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN. \nBENVOLIO So please you step aside. I'll know his grievance or be much denied. \nBenvolio clambers out of the limo. \nCLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile. \nMONTAGUE Come Madam. Let's away. \nEXT. STREET. DAWN. \nThe limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo. He pauses. A deck at the rear of \"Sick Amore\" sprawls onto the beach. At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo squatting in discussion with an old drunk. Benvolio approaches with a not very convincing casualness. \nBENVOLIO Good morrow, cousin. \nRomeo turns. Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at Benvolio. \nROMEO Is the day so young? \nBENVOLIO But new struck, Coz. \nRomeo rises, Benvolio follows. \nROMEO Ay me! Sad hours seem long. \nRomeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time. \nROMEO (CONT.) Was that my father that went hence so fast? \nBENVOLIO \n(GUILTY) It was. \nBenvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars. \nBENVOLIO What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? \nROMEO Not having that which having makes them short. \nBENVOLIO In love? \nROMEO Out. \nBENVOLIO Of love? \nROMEO Out of her favor where I am in love. \nBENVOLIO Alas that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof! \nROMEO Alas that love, whose view... \nRomeo is halted by the sight of last night's disturbance displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar. \n", "test1_id": 3087, "test2_input": "JULIET Good afternoon to my ghostly confessor. \nBut before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace, kissing passionately. \nFATHER LAURENCE \n(DRYLY) Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. \nThe choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly amorous smooching of the young couple. \nThe choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple. \nFATHER LAURENCE (CONT.) Come, come, and we will make short work. For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. \nA young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He launches into a wailing solo. \nMACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring. Engraved on the inside of the band are the words 'I love thee.' \nPULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet's finger as the priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage. \nINT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nCRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass, and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo. \nEXT. CHURCH. DAY. \nThe music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss. \nPeter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car. \nAs the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside. \nHOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away. \nEXT. UNDERWATER. DAY. \nFISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the water. \nA muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera. \nEXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY. \nWe see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to the beach - is hunting fish. \nBenvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard tower. \nA shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds. \nBENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire. The day is hot, \nMercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound of the shot. \nBENVOLIO (CONT.) The Capels are abroad. And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl. \nMercutio strides out of the water. \nMERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee!' (he hands Benvolio his gun) and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. \nAnother incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple. \nThe joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang. \nSuddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot. \nBENVOLIO By my head, here comes the Capulets. \nMERCUTIO By my heel, I care not. \nEXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY. \nThe sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres from Benvolio and Mercutio. \nTybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio. \nTYBALT Gentlemen, good day. A word with one of you. \nThe boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge - eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns. \nMercutio smiles mockingly. \nMERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a... \nLeaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) ...blow. \nMercutio scores. The boys laugh. \nTYBALT \n(FURIOUS) You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, (clutching at his side arm) And you will give me occasion. \n", "test2_true": "MERCUTIO (a breathy, coquettish \nVOICE) Could you not take some occasion without giving? \nThe boys fall about again. Tybalt cracks. \nTYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. \nThe accusation stings - Mercutio's anger flares. \nMERCUTIO Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick. \nIndicating his holstered gun. \nMERCUTIO (CONT.) Here's that shall make you dance. (barking at Tybalt) Zounds, (goading him to go for his gun) consort! \nCLOSE ON: Tybalt. \nCLOSE ON: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio tries to diffuse things. \nBENVOLIO Either withdraw unto some private place. Or reason coldly of your grievances. Here all eyes gaze on us. \nMERCUTIO Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. \nAt that moment, Romeo's car pulls into the lot. Tybalt smiles. \nTYBALT Well sir, here comes my man. \nTybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of happy news. \nTYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can \nAFFORD No better term than this: \nCLOSE ON: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side arm and issues the challenge. \nTYBALT (CONT.) Thou art a villain! \nCLOSE ON: Mercutio. \nCLOSE ON: Benvolio. \nAll eyes are on Romeo. \nRomeo calmly approaches his now cousin. \nROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining \nRAGE To such a greeting: villain am I none, Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not. \nRomeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused. He hurls himself into his sedan. \nKicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short distance to Romeo's car. Slamming into the back of it he blocks Romeo in. \nTybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down. Tybalt shatters the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming him against the savaged fuselage. \nTYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the \nINJURIES That thou hast done me! \nHe smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the roadway. \nTYBALT \n(YELLING) Turn and draw. \nA cut has opened in the side of Romeo's mouth. He unsteadily lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt's gaze, speaks through bloodied teeth. \nROMEO I never injured thee, And so, good Capulet, which name I \nTENDER As dearly as mine own... \nRomeo cautiously extracts his gun... \nROMEO (CONT.) ...be satisfied. \n...and throws it at Tybalt's feet. \nStorm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from the parking lot. \nMercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes. \nMERCUTIO O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! \nEXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY. \nTybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray. Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces. \nTybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo. \nSuddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden palings and yells... \n", "test2_id": 3088, "test3_input": "MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO) Mortal drugs? \nMEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO) Of lethal quantity as 'twould render death. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY. \nThey enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked with wedding decorations. \nCapulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background Gloria stares vacantly. \nMoving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds. \nINT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY. \nThe door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it. \nFATHER LAURENCE (to the man in black) As the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church. \nWhen the man in black allows two other dark suited men into the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker. \nUNDERTAKER She shall be borne to that same ancient vault Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. \nINT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY. \nA thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension.' \nPAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet mausoleum. \nOn view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet's peaceful body. \nWe move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows of the front door a young man hides. \nCLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar. \nPUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum. \nEXT. MANTUA. DAY. \nWe are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway. \nAs a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo's voice over: \nROMEO (V/O) If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand... \nCRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office. The driver alights and goes inside. \nINT. TRAILER. DAY. \nRomeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and writing in his notebook. The \"WE CALLED\" card lies next to an overflowing ashtray. \nHis voice over continues. \nROMEO (V/O) And all this day an unaccustomed \nSPIRIT Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreamt my lady came and found me \nDEAD And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself \nPOSSESSED When but love's shadows are so rich in joy. \nStubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway and into the trailer park. \nROMEO News from Verona! \nAn excited Romeo rushes from the trailer. \nEXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY. \nCRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept Balthasar's car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and Balthasar jumps out. \nRomeo yells joyously. \nROMEO How now, Balthasar? \nBathlasar cannot speak. \nROMEO (CONT.) Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my father well? How doth my lady Juliet? That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well. \nBalthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell. He looks away. \nBALTHASAR Then she is well and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault. \nFor a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm. \nROMEO Is it e'en so? \nBalthasar nods. \nRomeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland. \nCLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination. \n", "test3_true": "Romeo moves to the car. \nROMEO I will hence tonight. \nBalthasar tries to restrain him. \nBALTHASAR Have patience... \nExploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the vehicle. \nROMEO Leave me! \nCUT TO: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to his truck, the priest's undelivered envelope in his hand, the messenger looks toward the two boys. \nCUT TO: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo. \nBALTHASAR Your looks are pale and wild and do \nIMPORT Some misadventure. \nROMEO (with cold serenity) Tush, thou art deceived. (a niggling thought) Hast thou no letters to me from the Priest? \nBalthasar shakes his head. \nRomeo smiles. \nROMEO No matter - I will hence tonight. \nRomeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car. Balthasar reluctantly gets behind the wheel. \nAs silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the setting sun. \nPUSH IN: As he whispers: \nROMEO Well Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. \nBalthasar's car roars out of the park. \nCUT TO: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope in his hand, then gets back into his truck. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT. \nBalthasar's car speeds along the night-time highway. \nCRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT. \nBalthasar's car pulls into an alley and stops outside a decrepity apartment block. \nINT. APARTMENT BLOCK. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a shotgun protrudes menacingly. \nCUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway. \nROMEO Let me have A dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead. \nThe eye considers, a voice rasps back. \nAPOTHECARY Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them. \nRomeo speaks with fury. \nROMEO The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law. Then be not poor, but break it and take this. \nRomeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY'S face. \nBEAT. The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open. \nStanding in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something, he has a face scarred with age and abuse. \nAPOTHECARY My poverty, but not my will consents. \nCLOSE ON: Romeo. \nROMEO I pay thy poverty and not thy will. \nINT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT. \nCLOSE ON: Father Laurence. He speaks into the telephone with concern. \nFATHER LAURENCE Who bore my letter then to Romeo? \nINT. SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT. NIGHT. \nA bored clerk is on the other end of the line. The priest's letter is on the counter beside him. \nCLERK I could not sent it - here it is again. \nINT. PRESBYTERY.

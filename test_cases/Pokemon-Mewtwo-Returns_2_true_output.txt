Brock That may be for living beings but Mewtwo was made by humans. 
Misty But now he's a living being. 
Ash Now they are all living beings. Mew and Mewtwo, Pikachu and that other Pikachu. (Mew and Mewtwo's fight finally goes on ground and they both take off there force field. Mew and Mewtwo both shoots a beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing the 2 beams coming!) Stop! 
Brock Ash! (Both beams hit Ash and he falls to the ground and turns to stone.) 
Mewtwo It can't be. A human tried to stop our fight. (Pikachu runs out to Ash and starts shaking Ash. Then he thunder shocks him many times and Ash still doesn't move. Pikachu begins to cry. Then all the other pokémon look at Pikachu - including the copies and they start crying. All there tears float over and land on ash then last, Pikachu's tears fall onto Ash and Ash regains his hold on life, and turns back to flesh from rock) 
Ash Pikachu! 
Pikachu Pika pi!! 
Mewtwo Actually, both you and I are pokémon that already exist.

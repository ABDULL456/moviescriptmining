The elevator doors close and the car beneath the skylight begins to descend. 
GERARD 
Pulls up. 
GERARD Kimble! 
Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble and Nichols into... 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness. 
EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the shaft. 
GERARD'S POV 
Kimble's car disappears into the darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT 
Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency stop and the doors open. He disappears into... 
INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the giant machines. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves carefully into the laundry. 
... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers. 
... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by conveyor and dollies to automated dryers. 
The NOISE is DEAFENING. 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro. 
GERARD (to radio) Where did the elevator stop? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
NEWMAN IN SECURITY 
Newman checks the computer board for the elevator position. 
NEWMAN (to radio) Level five. 
INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT 
Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving. 
KIMBLE 
Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving between the large conveyors. 
ANGLE - SORTING ROOM 
Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters standing by a small conveyor as he enters. 
GERARD Get out of here. 
He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station. 
Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the main room. 
GERARD (to Renfro) We're going in. Give me five minutes. Keep C.P.D. out. 
He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main room. 
INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT 
He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover. 
He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker. 
Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a voice from the other end of the laundry. 
GERARD (V.O.) (above the din) Kimble! 
Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away. 
ON NICHOLS 
Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room where Gerard enters. 
ON GERARD 
The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro. 
They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated equipment. 
GERARD ... There is no way out of here. 
The building is locked down. 
CUT TO: 
KIMBLE 
Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts. 
GERARD (O.S.) Kimble... I know about Nichols. I know about Sykes. Kimble stops. 
ON GERARD

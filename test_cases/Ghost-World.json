{"test1_input": "Ghost World \n\"GHOST WORLD\" \nby \nDANIEL CLOWES \nand \nTERRY ZWIGOFF \nOPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING \nWe MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that define and establish our setting, from commercial district to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. As we track past at window-level we see: \nA glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays.. \nAn empty room... \nA large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed potatoes with his fingers... \nA dazed old woman staring out the window. \nThe silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself. \nWe enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted back as she dances along to the video while trying on a GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY. \nA modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner with a \"Coca Cola\" logo reads: \"GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM.\" \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY \nA graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh. \nShe makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices. \nSPEAKER High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences.  After all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. In coming to terms with my own personal setback, which I'm sure you've all heard about, I've been able to learn a lot about myself. I've learned for one thing that I don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol (APPLAUSE) and that I'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself weren't hurt in the accident; I've learned that I'm blessed with wonderful parents, teachers and above all the best classmates in the world -- I love each and every one of you guys!! (APPLAUSE) and I've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor. (BIG APPLAUSE) \nA trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. The audience loves them. \nEBONY No more eduCATION... \nVANILLA It's time for celeBRATION... \nJADE 'cause this is the day of our high school GraduATION... \nEBONY We've stayed for the durATION... \nVANILLA Achieved matricuLATION... \nJADE Now we're the newest members of the general popuLATION... \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release. \nEnid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath. \nENID God, what a bunch of retards... \nREBECCA I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up. \nENID I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her. \nREBECCA It's totally sickening. (she unrolls her DIPLOMA) Let's see if they gave me the right diploma... \nEnid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page. \nENID What?... Oh suck my fucking dick! \nREBECCA What? \nENID These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class! \nREBECCA Why? \nENID Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an \"F\" that means you have to take the class over again. \nREBECCA You loser. \nEXT. \"DAYS INN\" HOTEL - EVENING \nThe sign reads \"Welcome Graduates\". \n", "test1_true": "Party in progress in the \"Gold Room\". A band plays TOP-40 \"lite\" rock \nREBECCA (watching band) This is so bad, it's almost good. \nENID This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again... \nCLOSE-UP ON ENID, we see the party from her POV: The six or seven MOST POPULAR STUDENTS huddle closely together. \nENID Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again. \nREBECCA Unless they're in your Summer school class! \nENID Shut up! \nREBECCA Uh oh... don't turn around... \nENID What? Why? \nREBECCA Forget it... \nMELORRA, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate, approaches them. \nMELORRA Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it! \nENID Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing. \nMELORRA So what are you guys doing this Summer? \nENID Nothing. \nMELORRA I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer! \nENID Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen... \nMELORRA (spotting better people to talk to) Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS! \nMelorra leaves. \nENID Since when is she an \"actress\"? \nREBECCA I know, she needs to die immediately. \nTODD, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy, approaches from behind. \nTODD Hey Rebecca! \nREBECCA Oh... hi... \nTODD (pause) So... we finally -- \nENID What about me? Am I not even here? \nTODD Oh, hey Enid... (starting over) So... we finally made it! \nREBECCA Yep. \nTODD (awkward pause) So... where are you going to college? \nENID (before Rebecca can answer) We're not. \nTODD Really? Both of you?... Why not? \nENID Just because. \nREBECCA We have other plans. \nTODD I guess I should have figured that you two would do something different. \nENID What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd? \nTODD Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications. \nENID See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. (pause) \nTodd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off to the side. \nTODD So... I -- \nEnid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he can finish his sentence. \nENID Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh? \nREBECCA How perfect. \nENID He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her. \n", "test1_id": 2922, "test2_input": "ENID (sighs) ...maybe we should be lesbos... \nREBECCA Get away from me! \nINT. ENID'S FANTASY - EVENING \nStarts on full moon in night sky, framed right -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n...a dark moonlit room. Enid lies on her stomach in bed. We MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts, which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of light -- a cracked-open bathroom door. \nWE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed. \nThey begin to kiss. After a passionate moment, the door opens. Rebecca stands there, stunned. \nCUT BACK TO: \nWe see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness. She sighs. \nINT. ART CLASS - DAY \nCLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS. \nROBERTA Who is this, Enid? \nENID It's supposed to be Don Knotts. \nROBERTA And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject? \nENID I dunno... I just like Don Knotts. \nROBERTA I see... interesting... \nShe moves on. \nROBERTA What do we have here, Margaret? \nMARGARET It's a tampon in a teacup... \nClass GIGGLES. \nROBERTA I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this? \nMARGARET It's a \"found object\"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art. \nROBERTA Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent? \nMARGARET I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like... \nROBERTA This shocking image of repressed femininity! \nMARGARET Right, exactly! \nROBERTA I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret! \nEnid gives Margaret another dirty look. \nROBERTA This illustrates perfectly what I was saying about not being afraid to use controversial imagery, class... \nEXT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - DUSK \nSeymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an obnoxious AM Disc Jockey. \nDISC JOCKEY KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening. \nSEYMOUR God, that asshole's voice is so hateful! No wonder I never listen to the radio! \nENID (shutting it off) Relax, Seymour, relax... \nSEYMOUR That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face! (imitating insincere DJ voice) KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening... \nShe changes the subject and holds up a 78 record. \nENID So, why did you bring this along? \nSEYMOUR I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult! \nENID This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from. \nSEYMOUR I'm not holding my breath in that department. \nSeymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross.. \nSEYMOUR What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!? \n", "test2_true": "EXT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT \nA marquee reads, \"TONITE: BLUESHAMMER also FRED CHATMAN\" \nINT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT \nFRED CHATMAN, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. He's good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS. Most of them are more interested in a baseball game showing on a big-screen TV. \nSEYMOUR I can't believe these people! They could at least turn off their stupid sports game until he's done playing! \nFRED finishes to POLITE APPLAUSE. An M.C. takes the mic. \nM.C. Let's hear it for Fred Chatman. (a little more APPLAUSE) Hey don't go away because we've got Blueshammer coming up in just a minute! \nA CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her drink. Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as if to say, \"check it out.\" \nSEYMOUR Yes, that would certainly do... \nENID Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it? \nSEYMOUR Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No... \nENID Just wait here. \nEnid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving Seymour a \"thumbs up.\" \nCUTE GIRL Hi. \nSEYMOUR Hello. Uh... that was great music, huh? \nCUTE GIRL (sitting down) Yeah, I just love blues. \nSEYMOUR Actually, technically what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the \"ragtime\" idiom. Although of course not in the strictest sense of the more classical ragtime piano music like that of Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic Blues has a more conventional twelve- bar structure in its stanzas. \nCUTE GIRL Oh if you like authentic blues, you've just gotta see Blueshammer!  They're so great! \nANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on. \nShe sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty boys. \nLANCE (LEAD SINGER) All right people! Are you ready to BOOGIE? Cuz we gwine play you some authentic, way-down-in-the-delta blues to rock your world! One, Two, Three... \nA din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music. \nSeveral horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's still sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her. \nSeymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward the bar where Enid sits. \nSEYMOUR What did you tell that girl? \nENID I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label. \nSEYMOUR Jesus... \nINT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - NIGHT \nSEYMOUR Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet. \nENID We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all. \nSEYMOUR Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless. \nENID It's not hopeless... \nSEYMOUR Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity. \nENID Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless... \nSEYMOUR But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me... \nENID I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else... \nSEYMOUR Hooray for me. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S APT. - NIGHT \nEnid walks in behind Seymour. \nSEYMOUR I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some -- \nENID It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet. \nSEYMOUR \"Yet.\" \nINT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 2923, "test3_input": "ENID (pause) Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more. \nEXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING \nA LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nEnid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord friendly J. Crew outfits. \nENID Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood... \nREBECCA It's a totally normal, average neighborhood! \nENID I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life. \nREBECCA Josh says this is a really good neighborhood... \nENID What? When did you see Josh?! \nREBECCA He came into work. \nENID Why? What did he say? \nREBECCA Nothing. \nENID When was this? \nREBECCA I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes. \nThey walk along in conspicuous silence. \nREBECCA Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? (looks around) That must be it... \nENID (without enthusiasm) Great... \nREBECCA What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it? \nENID I said \"great\"... \nREBECCA Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it! \nENID Well, what am I supposed to say? \"I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere\"?! \nREBECCA There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?! \nENID Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it. \nA few passersby stop to watch. \nREBECCA You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended! \nENID You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy! \nREBECCA (as she walks away giving her the finger) FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life! \nINT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nEnid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn about the floor. \nENID God FUCK YOU TOO! \nWe see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends to be asleep. \nDAD Pumpkin? What's wrong? \nENID (her back to him, doesn't move) Nothing. \nDad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her shoulder. \nDAD If there's something wrong I wish you'd tell me about it... \nEnid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of the bed, facing away from him \nENID It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it... \nDAD I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling... \nENID What? \nDAD (speaking slowly and methodically) Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want. \nEnid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before she bursts into tears, utterly defeated. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY \n", "test3_true": "INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS \nRoberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE. \nThey're covering a STUDENT in plaster. \nENID Hi I brought over my application for the art academy... I hope it's not too late... \nRoberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid. \nROBERTA Just a minute... \nThen, realizing who it is... \nROBERTA Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened. \nENID What do you mean? \nROBERTA The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely -- \nENID Huh? \nROBERTA Didn't Principal Jaffee call you? \nENID I didn't check my messages... \nROBERTA Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you. \nENID Help me what? \nROBERTA Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall! \nENID (pause, overwhelmed) But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy? \nROBERTA I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can -- \nThe PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning noise. \nEX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE (flustered, to Roberta) Hey, can you help me out over here? \nEXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY) \nEnid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER \nShe continues walking until she's across the street from Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly, a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls up to the stop and Norman gets on. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM) \nA knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants, and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees Enid. He opens the door. \nSEYMOUR What are you doing here? \nENID I had to see you. \nSEYMOUR What's up? \nENID Can you at least let me in? \nSEYMOUR Uh... sure... come in. \nENID (crying) Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone. \nSEYMOUR What's the matter? \nENID Do you have anything to drink? \nEnid goes to look for herself. \nSEYMOUR Uh... I think there's some root beer... \nENID What about this? \nShe returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne. \nSEYMOUR That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not -- \nENID (as she starts opening) FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana. \nShe opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's look says: \"Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up.\" \nINT.

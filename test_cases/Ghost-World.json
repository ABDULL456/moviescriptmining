{"train": "Ghost World \n\"GHOST WORLD\" \nby \nDANIEL CLOWES \nand \nTERRY ZWIGOFF \nOPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING \nWe MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that define and establish our setting, from commercial district to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. As we track past at window-level we see: \nA glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays.. \nAn empty room... \nA large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed potatoes with his fingers... \nA dazed old woman staring out the window. \nThe silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself. \nWe enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted back as she dances along to the video while trying on a GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY. \nA modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner with a \"Coca Cola\" logo reads: \"GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM.\" \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY \nA graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh. \nShe makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices. \nSPEAKER High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences.  After all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. In coming to terms with my own personal setback, which I'm sure you've all heard about, I've been able to learn a lot about myself. I've learned for one thing that I don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol (APPLAUSE) and that I'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself weren't hurt in the accident; I've learned that I'm blessed with wonderful parents, teachers and above all the best classmates in the world -- I love each and every one of you guys!! (APPLAUSE) and I've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor. (BIG APPLAUSE) \nA trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. The audience loves them. \nEBONY No more eduCATION... \nVANILLA It's time for celeBRATION... \nJADE 'cause this is the day of our high school GraduATION... \nEBONY We've stayed for the durATION... \nVANILLA Achieved matricuLATION... \nJADE Now we're the newest members of the general popuLATION... \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release. \nEnid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath. \nENID God, what a bunch of retards... \nREBECCA I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up. \nENID I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her. \nREBECCA It's totally sickening. (she unrolls her DIPLOMA) Let's see if they gave me the right diploma... \nEnid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page. \nENID What?... Oh suck my fucking dick! \nREBECCA What? \nENID These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class! \nREBECCA Why? \nENID Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an \"F\" that means you have to take the class over again. \nREBECCA You loser. \nEXT. \"DAYS INN\" HOTEL - EVENING \nThe sign reads \"Welcome Graduates\". \nTodd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around by himself. \nENID God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again. \nREBECCA Good. \nENID God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing. \nINT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY \nThe QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her sketchbook when Rebecca arrives. \nREBECCA Hi. \nENID Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists. \nREBECCA Why? \nENID Just look at them! \nREBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up. \nREBECCA So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment? \nENID Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes. \nREBECCA Did you sign up yet? \nENID Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest. \nREBECCA God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling. \nENID I know, it hasn't really hit me yet. \nEnter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual smirk. \nJOHN Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend. \nENID You're late, asshole. \nJOHN Fine, and how are you? \nENID Did you bring that tape? \nHe puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach. \nJOHN You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine. \nENID I did too! \nJOHN Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money... \nENID Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick! \nREBECCA Hey, look, the satanists are leaving! \nENID We should follow them! \nAs the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even though it's a bright, sunny day. \nREBECCA Totally... Oh my God, look! \nThe girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape. \nENID (to John) Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke. \nJOHN Hey, where are you going? \nENID Later, \"Dude\". \nREBECCA Much later. \nENID In fact, never. \nEXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY \nUnder harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block behind the SATANISTS. \nREBECCA What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway? \nENID You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff... \nREBECCA That lets us off the hook. \nEXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED \nREBECCA We should call him and pretend to be the redhead. \nENID Oh, we totally have to. \nEnid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook. \nCU of sketchbook. \nINT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nEnid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see. \nNASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.) So what happened next, Donna? \nDONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.) Then I told him he'd better take out his hose and pump me! \nNASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.) Don-na?! \nDONNA (V.O.) You guys! My car was out of gas! \nLAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca. \nENID (whispers) Does Oomie really like this show? \nREBECCA (whispers) Isn't it weird? It's her favorite. \nOOMIE Girls! Shh! \nEnid and Rebecca exit. \nINT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING \nRebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR. \nREBECCA So what should we do? \nENID Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape. \nREBECCA What is this? \nENID I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace. \nSound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the sketchbook. \nREBECCA Wait, what is that? \nEnid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD. \nENID & REBECCA EEEEWWWW! \nEnid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a bookshelf under the television. \nENID Hey - why do you have this? \nREBECCA You lent it to me in like tenth grade. \nENID I've been looking all over for this. \nANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses. \nENID Look at how cute I am! \nREBECCA What a little hosebag. \nANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID & REBECCA at a party. \nENID Look, that's back when I hated you. \nREBECCA I remember every minute of that party. \nENID (another page) There's my dad with Joanie. \nREBECCA I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? \nENID No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine. (finds a picture) There! Look at her! \nANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE. \nENID What a fucking monster! \nSomething on TV catches Rebecca's eye. \nREBECCA Oh my God! This is that comedian I was telling you about! You have to see this guy -- he's the absolute worst! \nA dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a contrived \"I'm a weirdo\" shtick. \nBOSS Hey! I told you: No shirt, no service! \nDOUG (as he leaves) Fuck you, man! \nENID So Josh... \nJOSH Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done. \nEnid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades and replaces them with her standard horn-rims. \nREBECCA (nudging Enid, points outside) Look at this! \nOutside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS sees this and goes out to yell at him. \nBOSS You get out of here! \nJosh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter. \nENID That guy rules! \nJOSH Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do... \nENID So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! \nJOSH No. \nREBECCA Please Josh? \nJOSH Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse. \nEXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY \nJosh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing in the back seat. \nJOSH Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes. \nENID It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you. \nEnid and Rebecca giggle. \nREBECCA So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us? \nJOSH He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody! \nENID God, I think Josh is too mature for us. \nREBECCA I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man. \nENID Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT! \nEXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY \nTheir car accelerates. \nINT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM. \nThe three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A BUSINESSMAN enters. \nREBECCA Look, maybe that's him! \nENID It's still twenty-five minutes early. \nJOSH Aren't there a million places like this? \nENID This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. \nJOSH So, where's \"Weird Al\"? \nENID SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down. \nREBECCA I want to \"make love\" to him. \nENID I'm going to tell him you said that. \nWEIRD AL approaches with menus. \nAL So nice to see you again, ladies. \nENID Hey, Weird Al, there's something my friend wants to tell you -- \nREBECCA SHUT UP! \nENID She says she wants to MMPH! \nRebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth. \nENID Oh my God, that's HIM! \nREBECCA Are you sure? \nENID Totally! Look! \nANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face. \nENID He's insane! \nREBECCA We should follow him home. \nJOSH Forget it. \nENID Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives? \nJOSH No. \nENID But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat... \nJOSH You need counseling. \nEXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nSeveral minutes have passed. Seymour parks. \nREBECCA God, he lives right in our neighborhood! \nSeymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building. \nENID He doesn't even look that bummed out, really. \nREBECCA I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off? \nENID This kind of thing must happen to him all the time. \nINT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY \nFULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR (\"LALALALALALA\"). \nWOMAN'S VOICE (cheap echo effect) Returning to the house of my Fatherfatherfatherfather... \nThe CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around. \nWe see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH. \nINT. ART CLASS - DAY \nThe lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut off. \nThere are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class. \nROBERTA That piece is entitled \"Mirror/Father/Mirror.\" I like to show it to people I'm meeting for the first time because it says so much about who I am and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin. And this is exactly what I'm hoping to get from each of you over the course of this Summer: a picture of your own self-exploration. My own background is in video and performance art, but I'm hoping that doesn't influence you and that you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal. At the end of the Summer, this class has been invited, along with several others in the area, to participate in a show of High-School art at the Neighborhood Activity Center. The title of the show will be \"Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue.\" I think the \"Brotherhood\" theme ties in nicely with the theme of self-discovery that I'd like to emphasize in this class. Are there any questions so far? (she's completely lost them) Great... \nEXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nEnid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment. \nENID This is way too creepy. \nREBECCA He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance. \nENID I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again. \nA pause. \nENID So what should we do? We can't just hide all day waiting for him to come out... \nEXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX \nThere are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME JOURNAL. \nENID This is girl mail. \nShe grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO. \nENID This is all computer catalogues and stuff... \nRebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE. \nREBECCA The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... (she flips through the mail) Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation! \nENID Bingo! \nShe shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner. \nHe pulls out a bland-looking record: \"COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, VOLUME THREE.\" Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her. \nSEYMOUR This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue. \nENID Wow! \nRebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her. \nENID How much is it? \nSEYMOUR A dollar seventy-five. \nENID Okay. \nShe pays him. \nSEYMOUR If you don't like it bring it back for a refund. We're here every Saturday. \nHe puts the record into a bag. \nENID I'm sure it's fine. \nINT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY \nEnid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading THE FREE WEEKLY. \nREBECCA That was truly pathetic. \nENID I know... I still can't get over that his name was \"Seymour.\" \nRebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She takes a pen out of her purse. \nREBECCA He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive... \nENID It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay? \nREBECCA What about the \"striking redhead in the yellow dress\"? \nENID Oh yeah... \nREBECCA He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one (circles it) ...Oh wait... (crosses it out) you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats... \nENID I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool... \nREBECCA That guy is many things but he definitely isn't \"cool\"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen... \nENID Yeah, but... you know what I mean. \nREBECCA Not really... \nENID Forget it, I can't explain it... \nAwkward silence. Melorra enters. \nMELORRA Oh my god, what are you guys doing here? \nENID What are you doing here, Melorra? \nMELORRA My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break. \nENID Well, we won't keep you. \nMELORRA I love this place... it's so - you know, \"funky.\" \nEnid and Rebecca look at each other. \nMELORRA What are you guys up to? \nREBECCA We're looking for an apartment. \nMELORRA God how cool. Where are you moving? \nENID We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking. \nREBECCA Somewhere downtown. \nMELORRA God that's so exciting! (looks at clock) Oops, I should go. Bye you guys! Call me. \nMelorra leaves quickly. \nREBECCA \"Funky\"? \nENID What, is she black now? \nThey watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive \"casual\" clothes with a fancy backpack. \nEnid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door; the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD. \nENID JOSH! \nREBECCA JOSH! \nENID & REBECCA JOSH! \nENID He's probably in there jerking off. \nREBECCA I'll bet he never jerks off... \nENID Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that. \nREBECCA Should we leave a note? \nEnid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer. \nENID Do you have a pen? \nShe writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. \"Dear Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door. Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber.\" \nREBECCA You're not really going to leave that are you? \nEnid pushes the note over his doorknob. \nEXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY \nREBECCA Why are we going here? I hate this place. \nENID It'll only take a second. \nINT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY \nThey enter. We see racks of books-with titles like \"Make Explosives At Home.\" Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack. \nCREEP #1 -- I'm telling you, you're wrong -- carpet beetles are the only way to get the flesh off a corpse...  Boiling is strictly for amateurs! \nENID Don't you creeps ever talk about anything nice? Don't you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the Easter Bunny? \nCREEP #1 Look who's talking - little miss badass... \nCREEP #2 Yeah, nice outfit - who are you supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper? \nENID Blow me, doofus! \nJohn Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid. \nJOHN ELLIS Didn't they tell you? \nENID Tell me what? \nJOHN ELLIS Punk rock is over! \nENID I know it's over, asshole, I -- \nJOHN ELLIS If you really want to \"fuck up the system\" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside! \nENID That's not even -- \nJOHN ELLIS Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money? \nShe wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him. \nJOHN ELLIS Oh, how \"punk.\" \nENID That tape sucked, by the way! \nJOHN ELLIS I'm so sorry if you were offended! \nHe heads toward the back room with the empty box. \nENID Go die, asshole! \nJOHN ELLIS Get a job! \nHe exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid. \nREBECCA What was that all about? \nENID It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it! \nREBECCA I didn't get it either. \nENID Everybody's too stupid! \nWe see several sketches, including the drawing of the SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class. \nROBERTA I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. (pause, points at WIRE SCULPTURE) Who is responsible for this? \nMARGARET I am. \nROBERTA Talk to us about it... \nMARGARET It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about. \nROBERTA Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier. \nMARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look. \nINT. \"MASTERPIECE VIDEO\" STORE - AFTERNOON. \nOn a monitor, a generic trailer is playing. \nMASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Hello and welcome to Masterpiece video. How may I help you this afternoon, sir? \nCUSTOMER I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2. \nMASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Yessir! Is it a new release, sir? \nCUSTOMER No, it's the classic Italian film. \nMASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 Let me look that up on the computer for you, sir! \n(FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER) Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with Mickey Rourke. It's in our \"Erotic Dramas\" section. \nCUSTOMER No, not \"9 1/2\", 8 1/2 , the Fellini film. \nMASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1 I'll check that for you sir. How do you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E- E-P-E-E...? \nWE SEE Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits. \nREBECCA How about this one? \nENID Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm. \nShe pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words \"Goodbye Cruel World\" on the base. \nREBECCA Ew ... when did you get that? \nENID This morning at Seymour's garage sale. \nREBECCA God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet? \nRebecca picks up another tape. \nREBECCA How about this? \nENID Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck. \nAn obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the video monitor. \nAnother MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE reshelves videos near them. \nMASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #2 (overly cheerful) Hello! How are you young ladies this evening? May I help you find a particular Masterpiece movie? \nENID No. \nThey walk by him. \nENID Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick. \nREBECCA We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job. \nENID I know a party we could go to... \nREBECCA What? Where?! \nENID It's a surprise. \nREBECCA I don't believe you. \nENID If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go? \nINT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nA depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid & Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD COLLECTORS mill about. \nJEROME There are some records I will pay serious money for, provided they're a sincere V plus. Other than that I'd prefer to just have them on CD. \nSTEVEN CDs will never have the presence of an original 78. \nENID I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute! \nSEYMOUR Oh, right... \nENID No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds... \nSEYMOUR Good luck... \nENID I'm totally serious! \nSEYMOUR Yeah, well... \nENID I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service! \nSEYMOUR I appreciate the offer but you really don't -- \nENID Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy! \nSEYMOUR Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really -- \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nAs Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes. \nENID What about her? Would you go out with her? \nSEYMOUR I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me... \nENID But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her? \nSEYMOUR I really didn't get a good look at her. \nA breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by. \nENID Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits? \nSEYMOUR (embarrassed) Jesus! \nENID C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl? \nSEYMOUR I'm just not one of those guys who has a \"type\"... \nENID Every guy has a type! \nSEYMOUR (he doesn't really mean this) I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive... \nThey walk by \"the pants.\" \nENID Hey look, there's Norman! \nHe's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop. \nENID Hi Norman. \nNorman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid. \nEXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY \nThey're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER. \nENID We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests. \nSEYMOUR Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself? \nENID Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance. \nSEYMOUR (sighs) Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably... \nENID Let's just say \"music\" - that way you only use up one... (spots The Sidewinder) Wait, we have to go in here for a second... \nINT. SIDEWINDER - DAY \nThey enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl. \nENID Hi Josh. \nJOSH (without turning around) Hi. \nENID I just stopped in to say hi. \nJOSH Yeah, well... hi... \nHe turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour). \nENID This is my friend Seymour. \nYUPPIE #1 I'd like a medium latte for here. \nREBECCA Can I get you a biscotti to go with that? \nYUPPIE #1 NO! Just the latte. \nEnid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns. \nENID (V.O.) Give me all your money, bitch! \nREBECCA Where did you get that? \nENID You won't believe it! Guess! \nREBECCA Where? \nENID Anthony's II! \nREBECCA No way... when? \nENID Just now... I went with Seymour. \nREBECCA You cunt! \nFELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart contraption. \nFELDMAN Excuse me - I can't read the trivia question! \nEnid is in the way. She reads it to him. \nENID \"Where on the human body is the 'Douglas Pouch' located?\" \nFeldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS. \nFELDMAN Slightly below the uterus on a female. \nHe takes his coffee and putters towards the door. \nENID That guy is totally amazing. \nREBECCA He does that every single day. \nYUPPIE #2 Can I get a decaf mocha to go? \nREBECCA Can I get you a... \nYUPPIE #2 NO, I don't want a biscotti with that. \nYUPPIE #2 pays and leaves. \nENID God, how can you stand all these assholes? \nREBECCA I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody. \nENID At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining... \nREBECCA He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy! \nENID That rules! \nREBECCA No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. \nENID But those are our people... \nREBECCA Yeah, well... (pause) So when are you going to get your job? \nENID I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time. \nREBECCA Like what? \nENID Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week. \nREBECCA (pause) God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me. \nINT. ENID'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEnid and her dad are eating breakfast. A 13\" TV sits on the kitchen counter behind them. \nTV COMMERCIAL (V.O.) (sincere) Hope comes in all forms. To the endangered white stork searching for wetlands it comes in the form of a sanctuary provided by people who care. Do people care? Chevron does. That's why at Chevron we're just as concerned... \nDAD Are you still looking for a job? Do you have any leads? \nENID Will you get off my back for once? \nDAD It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training. \nENID (sighs) ...maybe we should be lesbos... \nREBECCA Get away from me! \nINT. ENID'S FANTASY - EVENING \nStarts on full moon in night sky, framed right -- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n...a dark moonlit room. Enid lies on her stomach in bed. We MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts, which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of light -- a cracked-open bathroom door. \nWE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed. \nThey begin to kiss. After a passionate moment, the door opens. Rebecca stands there, stunned. \nCUT BACK TO: \nWe see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness. She sighs. \nINT. ART CLASS - DAY \nCLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS. \nROBERTA Who is this, Enid? \nENID It's supposed to be Don Knotts. \nROBERTA And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject? \nENID I dunno... I just like Don Knotts. \nROBERTA I see... interesting... \nShe moves on. \nROBERTA What do we have here, Margaret? \nMARGARET It's a tampon in a teacup... \nClass GIGGLES. \nROBERTA I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this? \nMARGARET It's a \"found object\"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art. \nROBERTA Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent? \nMARGARET I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like... \nROBERTA This shocking image of repressed femininity! \nMARGARET Right, exactly! \nROBERTA I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret! \nEnid gives Margaret another dirty look. \nROBERTA This illustrates perfectly what I was saying about not being afraid to use controversial imagery, class... \nEXT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - DUSK \nSeymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an obnoxious AM Disc Jockey. \nDISC JOCKEY KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening. \nSEYMOUR God, that asshole's voice is so hateful! No wonder I never listen to the radio! \nENID (shutting it off) Relax, Seymour, relax... \nSEYMOUR That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face! (imitating insincere DJ voice) KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening... \nShe changes the subject and holds up a 78 record. \nENID So, why did you bring this along? \nSEYMOUR I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult! \nENID This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from. \nSEYMOUR I'm not holding my breath in that department. \nSeymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross.. \nSEYMOUR What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!? \nThey both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an instrumental. \nENID (picks up an antique knick knack) Wow, this is so cool... \nSEYMOUR If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not? \nENID I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date... \nEnid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile. \nENID What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? \nSEYMOUR What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now. \nENID What, are you a klansman or something? \nSEYMOUR Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise? \nENID (quoting TV commercial in deep voice) \"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS\"! \nSEYMOUR Yeah, well \"Cook's\" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named \"The Coon Chicken Inn\" -- that's an early painting of their first logo. \nHe takes out a scrapbook. \nSEYMOUR I'm obsessed with all this stuff - this lost culture of the 20th century. \nShe looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo \"Cook's Chicken Inn.\" Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company. \nENID Why doesn't everybody know this? \nThe record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable. \nSEYMOUR (somewhat bitterly) It's ancient history. The same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco record. \nHe puts on another record. \nSEYMOUR Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them... \nENID You work at Cook's Chicken? \nSEYMOUR For nineteen years... \nENID What are you, a fry cook or something? \nSEYMOUR Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters. \nENID Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day. \nSEYMOUR Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me... \nENID Yeah, but still... \nSEYMOUR I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want? \nEnid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting. \nENID So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then (points at painting) even though there was stuff like this? \nSEYMOUR No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something... \nENID (suddenly) Hey, can I borrow this? \nSEYMOUR What? Why? \nENID I promise I'll take good care of it. \nSEYMOUR I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you -- \nENID Don't you trust me, Seymour? \nINT. ART CLASS - DAY \nWe see another wall of student art dominated this time by Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting. \nROBERTA Let's address some discussion to this piece. \nSNOTTY GIRL I don't like it. \nROBERTA Can you tell us why? \nSNOTTY GIRL I don't know. \nHIPPY-ISH BOY I think it's totally weak. \nBLACK GIRL Yeah, it's not right. \nENID What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick! \nMANAGER Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing? \nENID But I feel weird... it's so sleazy. \nMANAGER It's not optional! \nENID Jesus... \nCUSTOMER #2 Can I get a medium sprite? \nENID A medium sprite? Why sir, do you not know that for a mere twenty five cents more you could purchase a large beverage that has a volume of over twice that of a puny medium drink? (she gives MANAGER a look) ...I'm only telling you this because we're such good friends -- Medium is strictly for suckers who don't understand the concept of value! \nINT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY \nRebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid. \nREBECCA What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?! \nENID I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime... \nAn angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink. \nCUSTOMER I'm not at all happy with this latte what do you intend to do about it? \nEXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY \nIt's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of her apartment building. Rebecca arrives. \nREBECCA This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff. \nENID Fuck it. Everything must go! \nREBECCA Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase... \nA trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous looking stuffed animal. \nHIPSTER How much is this? \nENID That's not for sale. \nHIPSTER (noticing price tag) Wait, it says five dollars... \nENID Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided not to sell it... \nThe HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves. \nREBECCA What was that all about? I thought everything must go! \nENID Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus. \nA couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records. \nGIRL How much is this dress? \nREBECCA Oh my god, you're selling that? \nENID (long pause) That's five hundred dollars. \nGIRL What? \nENID Five hundred. \nGIRL You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars! \nENID I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity. \nGIRL Well why do I care about that? \nENID Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you. \nGIRL God, fuck you! \nEnid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book. \nENID Put that stuff back, it's not for sale. \nBOY What is this? Some fuckin' joke? \nENID Yes! Go away! \nThey stomp off. \nREBECCA Now are you going to get a regular job? \nShe shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream. \nDANA I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious! \nSEYMOUR Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies. \nDANA Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one? \nINT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING \nIt's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks impatiently at the phone. Time passes - it's 11 PM. She can't stand it anymore. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nSeymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting some ice in the kitchen. \nSEYMOUR Uh... hello? \nENID Hi, it's me... \nSEYMOUR Oh, hi... \nENID So, what happened? \nSEYMOUR (almost whispering) Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well... \nENID What? You're kidding me... \nSEYMOUR Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk... \nENID What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date? \nSEYMOUR Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye! \nHe hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca. \nINT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone RINGS. She picks it up. \nREBECCA Hello? \nENID Do you still want to do something tonight? \nREBECCA What happened to Seymour? \nENID (still shocked by this) I can't believe it - he actually scored! \nREBECCA How repulsive! \nENID So should I come over? \nREBECCA Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends... \nENID What are you talking about? Who? \nREBECCA Just some people from work... \nENID I don't believe you. \nREBECCA Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow. \nRebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere. \nEXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEnid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an uncharacteristically \"sexy\" outfit. \nJOSH Hi... what's up? \nENID Can I come in? \nINT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nShe goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany & Amber) is tacked to the wall. \nJOSH Are you the one who left that note? \nENID I guess. \nPause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa. \nJOSH So what's up? \nHe picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously. \nSeymour sits alone eating lunch. We see Enid approach stealthily from behind. \nENID Boo! \nSEYMOUR (very startled) YAAA! \nShe sits across from him. \nENID Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you... \nSEYMOUR Really? \nENID No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? \nSEYMOUR I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy... \nENID Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? \nSEYMOUR (he looks nervously at his watch) Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know... \nENID So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff? \nSEYMOUR Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon... \nENID (not convinced) Sounds good... \nSeymour looks again at his watch. \nSEYMOUR We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week -- \nENID What, are you trying to get rid of me? \nSEYMOUR No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and -- \nENID Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing? \nSEYMOUR I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how -- \nENID I dunno... okay, I guess... (pause) I fucked that guy Josh finally... \nSEYMOUR ...so... is he your boyfriend now? \nENID Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time... \nSuddenly, Dana enters. \nDANA Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early... \nSEYMOUR Dana! Hi! (pause as the gears whirl) Uh, Dana... this is Enid... \nDANA Hello... \nENID It's great to finally meet you! \nDana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid. \nDANA (looking back and forth between Enid and Seymour) How do you two know each other? \nENID I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me we're old friends. \nDANA Really? \nENID Yes, we're very close... In fact, I was standing right next to Seymour the first time you called. If not for me, he would have never called you back! \nDANA Is that right? \nSeymour begins to stammer some kind of response. \nENID (phony) Oops! Look at the time!  I've got to run! I'll stop by to see you some time, Seymour... (then to Dana) It was really great to meet you! \nINT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING \nEnid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters. \nDAD I have some good news for you, Pumpkin. \nENID (sigh) What is it now? \nDAD Are you still looking for a job? \nENID I guess. \nDAD Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them. \nENID Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help. \nMAXINE May I ask what you're doing? \nENID Shhh! \nMAXINE I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death! \nENID Oh yeah, like he even noticed. \nMAXINE Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do. \nWe hear Seymour on the machine in the background... \nSEYMOUR (V.O.) I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here... \nENID I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone! \nMaxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up the phone and dials. \nREBECCA (V.O.) Hello? \nENID I need to talk to you. \nINT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY \nEnid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform. \nENID I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you. \nREBECCA I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week. \nENID Please let me come with you. Please please please... \nREBECCA I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea. \nENID Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan. \nREBECCA But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job. \nENID I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off. \nINT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING \nEnid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly and sticks his head in. \nDAD Pumpkin, are you in there? \nENID Are you going to yell at me? \nDAD About what? \nDAD Yeah, I heard about that. \nENID I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days. \nDAD She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it. \nENID I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe. \nDAD Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up. \nENID What do you mean \"on his way up\"!? \nDAD I just buzzed him in. \nJust then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door. \nENID What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here! \nDAD But I can't -- \nENID JUST DO IT! \nDad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room. \nDAD (V.O.) I'm not sure when she'll be back... \nEnid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She has a terribly sad look on her face. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nSeymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique \"candlestick\" telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes. Joe walks by the doorway. \nJOE Well, here's where the fun never stops! \nSEYMOUR Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time. \nREBECCA (allows him to step inside but leaves the door open) Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you. \nSEYMOUR Why would she be hiding from me? \nREBECCA I don't know... where is she, then? \nSEYMOUR Maybe she's with Josh? \nREBECCA Josh!? Why would she be with Josh? \nSEYMOUR I don't know. \nREBECCA Why? What did she tell you? \nSEYMOUR She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was... \nREBECCA What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh? \nSEYMOUR I have no idea - I just want to... \nREBECCA Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy. \nSEYMOUR Really, I don't know enough about it to... \nREBECCA That slut! \nSEYMOUR (changing subject back to me) Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me? \nREBECCA (getting revenge on Seymour) Yeah, she thinks you're a dork. \nSEYMOUR Did she say that? \nREBECCA Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you. \nSEYMOUR What do you mean? \nREBECCA On that pathetic fake blind date. \nSEYMOUR What are you talking about? \nREBECCA Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological... \nSEYMOUR What fake blind date? What are you talking about? \nRebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she hands it to Seymour. \nREBECCA Here. Read it and weep. \nWe see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS. \nEXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON \nSeymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene. \nINT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON \nJosh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine. \nSEYMOUR I hope you had a good laugh at my expense. \nJosh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour. \nJOSH Huh... oh... hi... uh... \nSEYMOUR You want to see something funny? I'll show you something funny! \nAs he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying and gets more and more frustrated. \nJOSH HEY! \nJosh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling. Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry. \nThe Boss comes out of the back room... \nBOSS Josh! What going on here?! \nINT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT \nThe apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up. \nShe gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball. \nFADE TO BLACK \nTITLE CARD: \"SEVERAL MONTHS LATER\" \n", "test1_input": "SEYMOUR Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me... \nAfter several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling pause... \nSEYMOUR I knew it... it's my mother. \nVOICE ON MACHINE Uh... HI!  Uh... I'm calling for... um... you placed an ad in the Weekly over a month ago and... well, I'm the redhead in the yellow dress... at least I think I am... I saw the ad when you first placed it but I was in this relationship at the time so I cut it out, and now I'm not in the relationship anymore... (giggles) God, this is really confusing... anyway, if you still want to talk to me I can be reached at KL5-2603, that's my work number and my name is Dana... um... BYE! \nENID Wow! (feigning ignorance) What was that all about? \nSEYMOUR It's just somebody's idea of a joke... \nENID That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something? \nSEYMOUR (still confused) Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me. \nENID Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back! \nSEYMOUR How can you be so sure? \nENID Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real! \nINT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM \nEnid enters - a light is on in the kitchen. \nDAD (O.S.) Pumpkin? Could you come in here for a minute? \nShe walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. \nDAD Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine? \nMAXINE Hi, Enid. \nENID Hi. (to Dad) Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed. \nDAD I made spaghetti. Do you want some? \nENID I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow. \nMAXINE It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid. (no response from Enid) I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out... (another silent pause) What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl. \nENID I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards. \nINT. ART CLASS - DAY \nA toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly- made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly, sending pieces of his sculpture flying. \nIt's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front of her big painting. \nROBERTA Smile, Enid... \nEnid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off. \nRoberta now turns to address the class. \nROBERTA I'm going to miss you people... I feel that we've all done a lot of growing this summer. I hope that each of you feels as though you'll be taking away something from this experience; I know I certainly will be... \nA long \"poignant\" pause as she smiles admiringly at them. \nROBERTA Remember, the art show is this Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try to get there at least 15 minutes early. \nThe students get their things together and file out. \nROBERTA Enid, can I talk to you for a minute? \nENID Uh-oh. \nROBERTA Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year? \nENID I'm not really sure - working, I guess... \nROBERTA Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name. \nShe gives her a booklet and an application form. \nENID Hmm. \nROBERTA As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer... \nENID ...wow... \nROBERTA (pause) So what do you think? \nENID I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff? \n", "test1_true": "ENID I... \nROBERTA Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you. \nINT. INDOOR SHOPPING MALL - DAY \nEnid & Rebecca are in a Crate & Barrel-type store looking at housewares. \nENID I think one of us should fuck Josh... \nREBECCA Go ahead... \nENID No, really... \nREBECCA God, you're really obsessed... \nENID I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do... \nREBECCA I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that... \nENID Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try... \nREBECCA No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is. \nRebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware. \nREBECCA Look, we have to get these... \nENID I can't afford stuff like this right now. \nREBECCA I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move. (pause, sees towels) Aren't these the greatest towels? \nENID Why do you care about this kind of stuff? \nREBECCA Don't you want nice stuff? \nENID I can't imagine spending money on towels. \nREBECCA You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job. \nENID You're insane. \nREBECCA Do you still want to go to that thing tonight? \nENID What thing? \nREBECCA That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy. \nENID Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went. \nREBECCA God, I'm so sick of Seymour. \nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nSeymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40. \nSEYMOUR That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this. \nDANA Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream? \nDana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall. \nDANA Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending? \nSEYMOUR Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia? \nDANA Was it Bosnia? I forget... (pause) It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy. (pause) A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up. \nDANA Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon! \nSEYMOUR Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh... \nDANA Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet. \nSEYMOUR No, really I -- \nShe drags him around. He's still holding his ice cream. \nDANA C'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind. Just loosen up and feel the music! Here, put down your bowl of ice cream. \nShe takes his ice cream and puts it on a table. \nSEYMOUR (checking his watch) Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie. \nDANA Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away. \n", "test1_id": 2922, "test2_input": "ENID (pause) Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more. \nEXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING \nA LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nEnid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord friendly J. Crew outfits. \nENID Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood... \nREBECCA It's a totally normal, average neighborhood! \nENID I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life. \nREBECCA Josh says this is a really good neighborhood... \nENID What? When did you see Josh?! \nREBECCA He came into work. \nENID Why? What did he say? \nREBECCA Nothing. \nENID When was this? \nREBECCA I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes. \nThey walk along in conspicuous silence. \nREBECCA Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? (looks around) That must be it... \nENID (without enthusiasm) Great... \nREBECCA What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it? \nENID I said \"great\"... \nREBECCA Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it! \nENID Well, what am I supposed to say? \"I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere\"?! \nREBECCA There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?! \nENID Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it. \nA few passersby stop to watch. \nREBECCA You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended! \nENID You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy! \nREBECCA (as she walks away giving her the finger) FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life! \nINT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nEnid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn about the floor. \nENID God FUCK YOU TOO! \nWe see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends to be asleep. \nDAD Pumpkin? What's wrong? \nENID (her back to him, doesn't move) Nothing. \nDad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her shoulder. \nDAD If there's something wrong I wish you'd tell me about it... \nEnid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of the bed, facing away from him \nENID It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it... \nDAD I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling... \nENID What? \nDAD (speaking slowly and methodically) Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want. \nEnid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before she bursts into tears, utterly defeated. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY \n", "test2_true": "INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS \nRoberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE. \nThey're covering a STUDENT in plaster. \nENID Hi I brought over my application for the art academy... I hope it's not too late... \nRoberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid. \nROBERTA Just a minute... \nThen, realizing who it is... \nROBERTA Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened. \nENID What do you mean? \nROBERTA The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely -- \nENID Huh? \nROBERTA Didn't Principal Jaffee call you? \nENID I didn't check my messages... \nROBERTA Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you. \nENID Help me what? \nROBERTA Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall! \nENID (pause, overwhelmed) But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy? \nROBERTA I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can -- \nThe PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning noise. \nEX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE (flustered, to Roberta) Hey, can you help me out over here? \nEXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY) \nEnid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER \nShe continues walking until she's across the street from Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly, a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls up to the stop and Norman gets on. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM) \nA knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants, and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees Enid. He opens the door. \nSEYMOUR What are you doing here? \nENID I had to see you. \nSEYMOUR What's up? \nENID Can you at least let me in? \nSEYMOUR Uh... sure... come in. \nENID (crying) Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone. \nSEYMOUR What's the matter? \nENID Do you have anything to drink? \nEnid goes to look for herself. \nSEYMOUR Uh... I think there's some root beer... \nENID What about this? \nShe returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne. \nSEYMOUR That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not -- \nENID (as she starts opening) FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana. \nShe opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's look says: \"Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up.\" \nINT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEnid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle. \n", "test2_id": 2923, "test3_input": "ENID You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room. \nSEYMOUR I could never move - I've got too much stuff. \nEnid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. She goes over and picks it up. \nENID Where did you get this? \nSEYMOUR Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my \"old time thingamajigs.\" \nENID Jesus, how can you stand her? \nSeymour takes another slug off the bottle. \nSEYMOUR God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty! \nENID That's great! \"Half-empty\" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist! \nSEYMOUR If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed. \nENID What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life. \nSEYMOUR I'm just being realistic. \nENID At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags! \nSEYMOUR I hate sports. \nENID How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out? \nSEYMOUR You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity. \nENID Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that. \nSEYMOUR I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you? \nENID I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? \nSEYMOUR Yeah, sure. Of course. \nENID (contemplative pause) ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job. \nSEYMOUR What about Joe? \nENID Oh yeah... and Dana... (says her name with whiny, disdainful voice) You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you. \nSEYMOUR (more drunk than before) Yeah, well I like you too... \nTEN MINUTES LATER \nThe bottle is empty. \nENID You know what my number one fantasy used to be? \nSEYMOUR (pause) What? \nENID I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that? \nSEYMOUR I guess I probably used to when I was your age. \nENID It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again. \nSEYMOUR Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems. \nENID You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody! \nSEYMOUR I don't think I'm in any condition to drive. \nENID I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory! \nSEYMOUR So where would we go? \nENID Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us? \nSEYMOUR I dunno, I... \nENID I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want? \nSEYMOUR What do you want? \nENID What do you want? \nSEYMOUR I-I-I... \nENID What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life! \n", "test3_true": "This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful brevity. \nWE SEE Enid & Seymour, post-coital. \nENID God, Dana's going to kill you! \nSEYMOUR ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere? \nENID What?... Maybe... no... I dunno... \nSEYMOUR I will if you want to. \nENID No... forget it... \nSEYMOUR (embarrassingly sappy) I-I never expected anything like this to happen... \nENID Yeah, well... me neither... \nSEYMOUR You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me? \nENID I was just thinking out loud... (doesn't want to hurt his feelings) I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up... \nSEYMOUR But, I... \nENID Shhh... I really need to get some sleep. \nEnid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed and happy. \nSEYMOUR Good night... \nHe kisses her arm and goes to sleep. \nINT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nSeymour wakes up. Enid is gone. \nINT. DANA'S OFFICE - EXPANSION REALTY - DAY \nDana is on the phone. A lantern-jawed male COLLEAGUE listens in, his head pressed up against hers. \nDANA (into phone) It's a thirty-year fixed at five and- a-half... \nSeymour nervously enters her \"workspace\". Dana is pleasantly surprised - she stops her conversation. \nDANA (covering receiver) Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here? \nSEYMOUR Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call. \nDANA We're almost done. (she continues into phone) Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good! \nShe hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug. \nCOLLEAGUE Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well, I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna go start the paperwork. \nColleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour. \nDANA Hey... so, what brings you down here? \nSEYMOUR I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh... \nDANA What are you trying to say? \nSEYMOUR It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out. \nDana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly she breaks down sobbing. \nSEYMOUR I-I honestly never intended for this to happen... \nDANA Please tell me it isn't that teenager! \nSEYMOUR Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and... \nDANA I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me! \nShe starts crying again. Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort her. \nSEYMOUR Dana, I... um... \nDana pushes him away violently. \nDANA You disgusting pig! You're just an overgrown baby who can't deal with a woman your own age. You pathetic weakling! You make me sick! \nINT. ENID'S ROOM - THE SAME DAY \nEnid is now utterly defeated. The phone rings. She lets the machine pick it up. Maxine enters. \n", "test3_id": 2924}

Fleury stares at this freak show. Schmidt sticks out a paw. 
SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Damon Schmidt. State Department. I'm in charge of getting you out of here. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED and his INNER-CIRCLE exit a Suburban and approach: All in traditional dress. The Prince locks eyes with Fleury. 
IN THE BG, forklifts rumble-hiss to life, placing Jersey barriers around the community center. 
SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Don't let go of his hand first. Major disrespect. 
One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI- emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin. 
Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re- start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend- style. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED (in Arabic) This is our level of commitment to bringing Terrorists to justice: 
Motions to the Americans. No more unflattering a portrait: pre-coffee, post-twelve hour flight, hours unpacking... 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   60. 
As the cameras start flashing. Angle on Al-Ghazi and Haytham placed to stand next to the Americans. Haytham clearly not comfortable with this kind of attention. 
PRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D) We've invited American legal officials into our Kingdom despite current difficulties between the US and Islam. They will observe our advanced investigative techniques, offering helpful hints. (to Fleury in English) You will please honor me with your presence tonight at my home. (beat, a stunted nod) Yes. 
The Prince turns back to the convoy. Entire entourage follows. One of the Security Contractors catches the jacket Janet hurls back at him, tosses it to Leavitt. Convoy gone. The team turns: 100 glares again. Fleury blinks out the camera flashes, takes in all the eyeballs. 
Fleury looks up at a retreating Damon Schmidt. 
SCHMIDT Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home now? 
Dead eyes from Fleury. He's clearly not amused. 
SCHMIDT   (CONT'D) OK. If you change   your minds, I got a plane fueled up   and ready to go - got your name all   over it... 
He points a finger gun at Fleury. 
SCHMIDT (CONT'D) Strap your kevlar on tight, people. 
SCHMIDT takes off. Sykes by Fleury. 
GRANT SYKES Slow roll... gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and- 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   61. 
FLEURY Enough. 
Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him: 
POLICE OFFICER You're willing to die to protect your enemy? 
Haytham turns. An older POLICE OFFICER stands with a GROUP of SANG twenty feet behind him, eyeing Haytham. 
Back to Fleury: he looks to Al-Ghazi. 
RONALD FLEURY What did the Prince say? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) That there are more rules than just not working at night. 
RONALD FLEURY What rules? 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI You are here as observers. Not investigators. 
Fleury tries to remain cool. 
RONALD FLEURY That's not accurate-- 
Al-Ghazi ignores Fleury. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI --I need to make sure the sites are secure. Then you can begin observing. 
Leavitt looks around at the Security as Al-Ghazi hustles off: 
ADAM LEAVITT (to Fleury) How could they get more secure? 
The Team slowly realizes they're not going anywhere yet, dump their bags in a pile, already disgusted. 
In the distance, the group of SANG stare back at our team. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   62. 
68A   INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN                         68A 
Hold on an empty 2' X 1' X 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty linoleum floor. 
Ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty- gray plastic explosive. We immediately notice the right hand is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of detonating-wire emanating from each cap. 
Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty-gray plastic explosives. 
68B   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - LATER                      68B 
Al-Ghazi and General Malik stand outside. 
The Athan sounds for Dhuhr.

FIONA Honey, please calm down... 
Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside. 
SHREK Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut out for this, Fiona and I never will be. 
Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to Donkey. 
DONKEY I think that went pretty well. 
Shrek startles. 
SHREK Donkey! 
Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door. 
DONKEY Aww, come on now Shrek! 
Shrek slams the door shut. 
Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on his pillow. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13. 
PUSS Some people just don't understand boundaries. 
Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the blinds. 
Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries to calm him down. 
FIONA Just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin-filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect. 
This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath and exhales. He smiles. 
SHREK Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled." 
FIONA And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...? 
SHREK (LAUGHS) That's right. The swamp rats will be spawning. 
FIONA Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat. 
SHREK Donkey? 
FIONA No, Shrek. Um... what if - THEORETICALLY - 
SHREK Yeah? 
FIONA They were little ogre feet? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14. 
SHREK Oh. (NERVOUS LAUGH) 
Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed. 
He slowly emerges from behind the bed. 
SHREK Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop. 
FIONA Shrek. 
She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes. 
FIONA Don't you ever think about having a family? 
Shrek takes her hand. 
SHREK Right now, you're my family. 
There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open, revealing a Royal Page. 
Shrek springs up. 
SHREK Well, somebody better be dying. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KING'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing. 
KING HAROLD I'm dying. 
The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit. Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen comes to the King's aid and he settles down. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 15. 
QUEEN Harold. 
KING HAROLD Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian. 
The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs. 
QUEEN Of course darling. 
The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.

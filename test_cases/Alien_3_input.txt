The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself. 
STANDARD (CONT'D) Retract landing struts. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY 
The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force. The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Take us up. 
ROBY (into intercom) Up one kilometer, Jay. 
EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY 
The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Switch on lifter quads. 
A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES. 
EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY 
The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking atmosphere. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
STANDARD Engage artificial gravity. 
Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES. 
ROBY Engaged. 
STANDARD Let's take her into an escape orbit. 
The men get busy with switches. 
ROBY I'm altering our vector now; should give us an easy escape velocity -- 
A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP. 
ROBY & MELKONIS (in concert) What was that? 
In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS. 
FAUST (over, filtered) This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again! 
STANDARD Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all! 
The pitch of the engines changes, deepens. 
EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY 
The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds. Visibility is zero. 
INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM 
Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to suck up some of the dust. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY 
On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim, set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically they mutter technical instructions to each other. 
EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY 
Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it. 
INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE 
They all CHEER. 
ROBY (pounds his panel) We made it!  Damn, we made it! 
STANDARD You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive. 
ROBY With great pleasure. 
Roby begins to punch buttons. 
MELKONIS I feel like an escapee from Hell. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER 
The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around.

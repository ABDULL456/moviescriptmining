POLICE OFFICER 2 I'll be fucked... 
COREY (staring at the lights) Pedro, get in the truck. 
PEDRO Oh shit... 
Police Officer 1 speaks into the C.B. 
POLICE OFFICER 1 Hey Janice, tell Tim I found his car. 
From far off, Corey understands from the manner that the police officers have focused on the Mustang that they've been spotted. 
COREY Pedro, let's get the hell outta here! 
Police Officer 2 rushes out of the car, followed by Police Officer 
Pedro turns to Mitch. 
PEDRO Coge, keep this. 
Pedro practically throws the Stereo into Mitch's stomach. Mitch, completely shocked, drops his BEER and grabs the stereo out of instinct. Pedro darts for the passenger seat of the Tow Truck. 
MITCH What the hell am I supposed to do with this? 
PEDRO Keep it, mehn! I gotta go! 
COREY moves to the driver-side door of the Tow Truck and opens it, and climbs behind the wheel. Pedro climbs into the passenger seat. 
MITCH You better bring that truck back!   Harvey is pissed! 
Corey starts the Tow Truck and tries to shift it into gear. 
COREY Where the hell is first?! 
Pedro grabs the stick shift and throws it into first. 
PEDRO Drive, Pendejo! 
Corey hits the gas, and the transmission screeches its disapproval. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) Mehn, use the clutch! 
COREY Shit!   Where! 
The Tow Truck conks out. 
COREY (CONT'D) Goddammit! 
PEDRO We're fucked! 
Pedro opens the door and jumps out.   Corey remains seated, frozen, hands on the dashboard. 
POLICE OFFICER 1 quickly overtakes Pedro and throws him to the ground. POLICE OFFICER 2 rushes over to the Tow Truck and points his GUN at Corey. 
POLICE OFFICER 2 Out of the truck, asshole! 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BERUBI'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
HEATHER and RJ are in Berubi's bedroom. Heather is on top of RJ, and the sex is extremely rough. Heather notices the RED AND BLUE LIGHTS continue flashing on the curtains, staring, entranced by them. RJ looks up to see what she's staring at. 
RJ What the fuck?! 
Heather does not respond as she continues bouncing up and down on top of RJ. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, BACK YARD -- NIGHT 
COREY gets out of the truck, hands in the air. POLICE OFFICER 1 HANDCUFFS PEDRO. POLICE OFFICER 2 takes out his HANDCUFFS, spins Corey around by his arm, and throws him roughly against the tow truck, cuffing his hands behind his back. In the background, MITCH quietly places the stereo on the ground and begins walking indiscreetly toward the street. 
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 
POV on JIMMY, BOBBY, SINJIN and LOUIE staring at the wall opposite the door. Bobby is still holding what's left of Louie's WHEELCHAIR. Sinjin throws his hands up in disgust/disbelief. 
We see what they're staring at - KWON is climbing clumsily through the window. A large GUN falls heavily to the floor and KWON falls in after it. 
SINJIN Kwon!   What the fuck are you doin'? 
Kwon grabs his Gun and stands up, slightly out of breath from his climb. 
KWON Those are my drugs. 
Jimmy watches, powerless. 
SINJIN I just bought these. 
KWON From who? (pointing his Gun at Jimmy) 
Jimmy? I'm not here to argue.   Just gimme my drugs. 
SINJIN Alright, hold on. Slow down a second. What is this shit, Jimmy? 
KWON Tell him, Jimmy. 
>From O.S. a CHINESE STRESS BALL hits Kwon in the forehead. Dazed, Kwon can only blink his eyes tries to gather his senses. Bobby stares at Kwon a moment before landing his large fist square on Kwon's nose, knocking him empty-handed and on his ass beside Sinjin. Sinjin stands up to get between Bobby and Kwon.

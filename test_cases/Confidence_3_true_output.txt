CONTINUED: MR. LEWIS Perfect. SALESGIRL I' ll just go put this in, Mr. Lewis. The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away. A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there. JAKE Mr. Lewis? Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old friend. JAKE It is you.   Hello! Jake extends his hand. MR. LEWIS Sorry, I-- JAKE Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice. Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude. MR. LEWIS Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you. JAKE Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis? MR. LEWIS Great.   Thank you. The Salesgirl returns. JAKE Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson. SALESGIRL Do you have a ticket?

CONTINUED: JAKE You   know, this is kind of embarassing, but   my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But the   name's Pearson. MR. LEWIS While you're back there, could you make sure that Carolyn is spelled with a "y"? The Salesgirl nods and disappears again. MR. LEWIS (cont'd) What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend? JAKE My wife and I are just taking a little vacation. Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over. MR. LEWTS Carolyn's down this weekend too. Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for a second. LILY Uh... Everything okay? JAKE Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes. JAKE I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done. Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist. LILY It's okay.    I'll be looking for earrings. Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves. MR. LEWIS Attractive girl.

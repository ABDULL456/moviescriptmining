Exiting with the other Doors... Dog picking the duck up from the floor. 
DOG Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing. 
Pamela is sobbing, in a quiet bewildered voice, repeating to herself. 
PAM What the hell's happened to us Jim? What the hell is happening to us. There's some great poetry... 
On Jim... saddened. 
DOORS SONG You're lost little girl (2) You're lost, tell me Who are you? 
INT. TUNNEL - OUTDOOR THEATRE - NIGHT 
The backbeat of NOT TO TOUCH THE EARTH as a DOCUMENTARY FILM CREW, moves past us directed by MIKE and DOG and TOM shoot past us, sun guns, nagras ("Rolling! Speed!") then... 
A mad rush of HANDS and SCREAMS as SHAPES whip by under swinging light-bulbs -- big BLACK BODYGUARDS, six or seven of them, bulling their way thru the grasping faces, as MORRISON appears... camera swinging wildly with him to reveal: 
EXT. ARENA - (ANY CITY) - NIGHT 
THOUSANDS OF FANS roaring "DOORS! DOORS! DOORS!" 
VOICE (loudspeaker) Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles California -- The DOORS! 
SIDDONS (in crush) Jim! Your Mom's here with your brother. What do you want me to do with 'em? 
JIM (shakes his head) HIDE ME!!! 
HARD CUT TO: 
Madness. COPS lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. As Jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone, Indian style, one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. The stage is bottom lit, Dantean in look. The Doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions. DEA AGENTS in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards in hand. Blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for Jim to communicate with his audience. 
JIM & DOORS There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do But run, run, run Let's run, let's run... 
SIDDONS yelling at MIKE, the roadie. 
SIDDONS Vice Squad says one more "fuck or shit" they're gonna close us down man. 
MIKE Stick my dick in their ear! 
Jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman-like state, weird spiralling chords carrying over the following MONTAGE of hallucinatory insanity. 
JIM & DOORS House upon the hill Moon is lying still... 
EXT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT 
A POV up at the house -- into which JIM enters. The lights are on. Sage at the door sniffing. 
INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - LAUREL CANYON - NIGHT 
JIM & DOORS Shadows of the trees witnessing the wild breeze Come on baby run with me Run with me, let's run... 
JIM'S POV entering the bedroom -- PAMELA naked in bed with the COUNT, is snorting heroin. Shadows of the trees and leaves blowing against the walls. Their voices, dim, distant. 
JIM (ironic) Oh hi... I didn't realize you were entertaining. 
PAM (stoned) Hi. 
She sits up on the bed, wobbly. The COUNT, more sophisticated in these things, lights a cigarette from the bedside table, revealing heroin paraphernalia. 
COUNT Scusi Jimmy, I hope you're cool about this... 
JIM (very cool) Don't forget your smack on the way out. 
EXT. ARENA - CONCERT 
Jim's struggling to break through the barrier of cops. 
JIM (yelling) The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs You won't know a thing till you get inside 
BACK TO: 
INT. JIM & PAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The COUNT is gone. JIM, icy cold, grabs PAM by the wrist. 
JIM I told you about that shit. Or are we talking about death choices here? 
PAM I'm just doing my thing, just like you said, it's my thing, why can't I have a thing. Ow! You're hurting me! 
JIM (rising anger) Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT? Let me introduce you to my good friend hurt. 
He is on her, throws her from the bed. She runs and hides in the closet, slamming the door behind her. 
PAM (screaming) NO FUCK YOU! THIS IS MY... 
JIM (crazed) Ah sanctuary!... a soft place to hide. 
PAM (inside) ...from you, you pig! 
As he picks up a can of lighter fluid and douses the closet door and the floor. 
JIM I'll give you a place to hide forever! 
We INTERCUT with PAM inside the closet yelling for mercy inside. 
PAM JIM! 
He puts a candle to the drenched door/floor.

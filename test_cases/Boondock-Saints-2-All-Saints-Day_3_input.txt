Duffy, Greenly and the boys descend the tower. Greenly works the controls as Duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses. 
MURPHY It's ridiculous! Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie! And here I am AGAIN all tyin' myself up with rope! What is the deal with you and rope?! Honestly! 
CONNOR It happens ta be a useful thing! 
The boys start yelling over each other.   Duffy turns to Connor. 
DUFFY You didn't get this from a movie...did you? 
Murphy regards his brother, "well?"   Pause. 
CONNOR The "Eiger Sanction," Clint Eastwood! And it worked like a fucking charm for him! 
INT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME 
Romeo peeks out a cracked door at a Mafioso guard. LLOYD (33yrs), a janitor, gagged and duct taped to a hand truck. He has a shiner. Romeo looks through his wallet. 
ROMEO O'kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane, apartment 3C. (shows him wallet pic) Lovely wife and kids. How old are they? Nevermind. Here's the situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin' to do some killin' here tonight. I'm talking bullets and blood, custom-wholesale slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O? (Lloyd nods) Good. Now, I've run into a little snag. I need to figure out a tag line. You know, something cool to say when it's all over like..."I'll be back," but mine, y'know? I need to own this one. I think this'll help me get through the quote, unquote event. I'm going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little, o'kay? Let's have fun with this. 
Lloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag. 
LLOYD I can't believe you! I'm a fucking janitor. What do I know about bullets and slaughter and shit? 
ROMEO Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking suite and you're gonna help me think of one! 
EXT. SCAFFOLD -- LATER 
Eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold. 
EUNICE And you can count on it like the U.S. mail. Through rain, sleet, hail or snow...something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o' guns. 
The scaffold suddenly stops. 
CONNOR What the fuck? 
GREENLY (hitting controls) I don't know! It just stopped! 
MURPHY Well, get it fuckin' goin' again! 
GREENLY It won't turn back on!     It just died! 
BROTHERS 
OH, SHIT! 
The boys look over the edge.     Long way down. 
CONNOR How much time?! 
DUFFY (looks at watch) Sixty Seconds! 
MURPHY We gotta go now! 
DUFFY What are you talking about!? 
CONNOR If we're even a few seconds late, Romeo's dead! We gotta go! (looking up) We're down thirteen stories! 
MURPHY Eleven more to go!     Ball park it! 
They start counting out lengths of rope by feeding them through their hands and extending their arms out to the sides. 
BROTHERS One floor, two, three... 
MURPHY 
(MIFFED) The fuckin' Eiger Sanction. 
INT. JANITOR CLOSET -- SAME TIME 
Lloyd struggles to think. 
LLOYD Uh..."Take that, suckers!" 
ROMEO Not cool enough. 
LLOYD Uh, "Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!" 
ROMEO Too sacrilegious. 
LLOYD Oh God, uh, how about "Eat it!" 
ROMEO What are we at, a buffet, now? 
LLOYD Good God, man! I'm a...

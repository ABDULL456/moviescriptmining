ACE WOODY These the new chickens? 
CALVIN CANDIE Yes siree bob. 
ACE WOODY How many you get? 
(HE COUNTS) One, two, three, four, five. 
CALVIN CANDIE Five real strong bucks. 
ACE WOODY How many you get rid of? 
CALVIN CANDIE We still got three left. Ace looks to see who came back from the auction. Leo Moguy chimes in; 
MOGUY I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people, they'll be here tomorrow. Ace turns to Brown. 
ACE WOODY Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in the pen till tomorrow. Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into the slave pen. Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua. 
ACE WOODY Y'all stand over there and make a line! They do. Ace climbs down from off his horse. Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse. Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show. Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men. Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says; 
CALVIN CANDIE What do you think? 
ACE WOODY I think you lookin' for niggers to push a plow, 'dem your boys. Candie rolls his eyes. 
CALVIN CANDIE What's wrong with them? 
ACE WOODY Hold it...hold it, you done bought r em, let me look at 'em. Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them. 
ACE WOODY Okay, how 'bout that one, did you buy that one? 
CALVIN CANDIE Which one? 
ACE WOODY What you mean, which one? The one I'm pointing at, that one. 
CALVIN CANDIE Actually, that one was purchased by our mister Moguy. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO MOGUY) You bought him? 
MOGUY Yes I did. 
ACE WOODY Why? 
MOGUY I like his prospects. 
ACE WOODY His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy, I ain't a educated fella like yourself. Remind me again what prospects means? 
MOGUY Hope for the future. Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question. 
ACE WOODY You got hope for his future? 
MOGUY I did. 
ACE WOODY Well I don't. Ace walks over to the slave in question. 
ACE WOODY What's your name, boy? The mandingo says; 
SIDNEY JAMES Sidney James, sir. 
ACE WOODY So long Sidney James. Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS Sidney James point blank in the belly. Everybody reacts. 
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him. Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut. Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery. Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks. Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch. Ace looks up at his boss. 
ACE WOODY Boss Candie, which one did you buy? 
CALVIN CANDIE Well to me the pick of the litter is Big Fred over there.

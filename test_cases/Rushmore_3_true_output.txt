Miss Cross' class. A little boy named BENJAMIN reads his story in front of the class. Miss Cross sits in a chair at the back. Max appears in the doorway. 
BENJAMIN 
On the planet I'm from the sun only comes out once a year. That is - 
Max coughs loudly. Miss Cross turns around. Max motions to her. She holds up her index finger for him to wait. 
BENJAMIN 
That is why my skin is the color of a cloud, said the old - 
MAX 
(loudly) 
I just came by to thank you for wrecking my life. 
Max slams the door. 
Max stands alone smoking a cigarette in front of a pile of leaves. A LAWN CREW is raking in the background. 
Max strikes a match, throws it on the leaves, and watches sadly as the leaves burn and smoke rises black into the crisp autumn air. He takes off his Rushmore blazer and throws it on the fire. He looks up at the sky and says quietly: 
MAX 
Sic transit gloria, Mr. Blume. 
Sic transit gloria. 
EXT. PARK. DAY 
A cold day. Dry leaves fall from the trees in the park. 
Mr. Blume comes down the path to Max sitting alone on a bench. Max is dressed in blue jeans, a plaid shirt, a ski cap, and huge down parka. Mrs. Blume is wearing a topcoat and gloves. Max stands up to shake hands with her. 
MAX 
Thank you for meeting me. 
MRS. BLUME 
(coldly) 
You're welcome. 
MAX 
Would you like a sandwich? 
Silence. Mrs. Blume looks around the park. 
MRS. BLUME 
All right. 
She sits down. Max takes two sandwiches out of his backpack. 
MAX 
I have tuna fish and I have peanut butter and jelly. I'm sorry it's not something more exotic. 
MRS. BLUME 
I'll take the tuna fish. 
Max gives her the tuna fish sandwich. 
MAX 
Milk or apple juice? 
Max holds out the two drinks. Mrs. Blume just stares at him. 
MAX 
You want me to cut to the chase? 
Silence. Max puts down his sandwich and gathers his thoughts. 
MAX 
OK. As you know, Mr. Blume and I used to be friends. 
MRS. BLUME 
I have no idea what the relationship is between you and Herman. Honestly, I find it very bizarre. 
MAX 
(taken aback) 
What do you mean to imply? 
MRS. BLUME 
I'm not implying anything. You make a very strange couple. It's too bad Herman doesn't have that kind of affection for his own children. 
MAX 
Well, I'm sure he does. 
MRS. BLUME 
No, he doesn't. 
MAX 
I know you don't really mean that. 
MRS. BLUME 
(angry) 
Of course, I do. 
MAX 
From his perspective it's - 
MRS. BLUME 
Why did you call me? 
MAX 
That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
MRS. BLUME 
(icily) 
Please. Get to the point. 
MAX 
Gladly. Your husband's fucking a schoolteacher, pardon my French. I thought you should know. 
Silence. 
MRS. BLUME 
Why are you telling me this? Are you trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you trying to hurt me?

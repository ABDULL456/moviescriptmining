MARTIN Diane, come on, come on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Mini looks up at the counter. AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink. 
MINI Martin... H e looks up and immediately sees the bottle. 
MINI I picked that prescription up three days ago. It was probably more than half full. 
The two of them look at each other, studying each other's reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make the first move. 
MINI (eerily calm) I suppose we should call an ambulance? 
The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's wrist again. 
MARTIN Her pulse is almost gone. 
MINI Do you really think they can save her? 
MARTIN I...I don't know. 
MINI She'll only try it again. You know she will. 
MARTIN She will if we keep this torture up. 
Martin looks down at Diane. 
MARTIN (suddenly with resolve) This is wrong, call an ambulance. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI Hold on, who are we to say her choice was wrong? She put those pills in her mouth. 
MARTIN Mini-- 
MINI Don't "Mini" me, you've been bankrolling my little project from day one. 
MARTIN We both agreed murder was out. 
MINI I'd hardly call it murder, if anything, we're just helping to fulfill her last wish. 
MARTIN She wouldn't have taken the pills if we hadn't- (urgently) Mini, for gods sake, she still has a pulse. 
MINI So do people in comas. It's just a matter of time- 
MARTIN Mini, we- 
MINI Look, you can drop the indignant outrage, because if you really cared, you'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now. 
She's got him and he knows it. 
MINI (softening) Can't we just admit how lucky we are? It's the perfect alibi, she put the drugs in her system. 
MARTIN What? Just leave her here? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MINI Exactly. 
MARTIN I don't know. 
MINI Can you think of one person she knows who would say she's sane at this point? This is just the natural, sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life. M artin ponders the choice. 
MINI We're this close from being free...let's just let nature take its course. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER. 
Mini and Martin sit watching a game show called Absolutely Positive. 
MINI And so we passed the time watching my favorite show. 
CLOSE ON THE TV: 
A YOUNG MALE GAME SHOW HOST comes out on stage to the applause of the audience. 
HOST Welcome to "Absolutely Positive!" The show where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure they're... 
He puts a hand to his ear, encouraging the studio audience. 
STUDIO AUDIENCE Absolutely Positive! 
HOST That's right! We send them out on one last date with someone other than their fiance, so they can be sure they're really ready to make that lifelong commitment.

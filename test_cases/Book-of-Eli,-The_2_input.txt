He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog- eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more. 
Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing. 
He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them. 
MANY PAGES LATER 
Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else. 
A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli reaches into his pocket and produces: 
AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears. 
The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor. Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up. 
THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one. 
MORNING 
Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep. 
The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns. 
He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons. 
ELI Come on now. 
The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out. 
EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING 
The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard. 
He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt. 
The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY". 
Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash. 
The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up. 
She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified. 
YOUNG WOMAN Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it. 
She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles. 
ELI I'm not going to hurt you. 
YOUNG WOMAN That's what the last guys said. 
Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. Steps forward and offers them to her. 
ELI Here. 
She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it. 
YOUNG WOMAN Could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I can't. 
Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road. 
He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate. 
He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert. 
Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched, waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They exchange anxious looks. 
ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl. 
ELI One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off. 
The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's. 
The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet. 
BANDIT LEADER Dumb bitch. What did we tell you? 
He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap. 
Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him. 
BANDIT LEADER What you got there in the pack?

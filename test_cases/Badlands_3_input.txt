He starts off in the direction of the car, but Holly calls him back. 
HOLLY I don't want to. 
Kit looks at her. surprised. 
KIT Have you got a better idea? 
HOLLY I just don't want to go. 
KIT What? 
She shrugs. He stares at her for a moment, then bows his head and walks off a distance. 
KIT What is wrong with you, huh? 
He kicks wildly at dust. 
KIT What is the matter with you, huh!? 
Meanwhile, the helicopter continues its approach. Kit walks in closer to Holly. 
KIT Boy, I don't know what to make of you. People like you. 
He kicks at the rigs then turns back to face her. 
KIT You want a second chance, then listen. Twelve noon the Grand Coulee Dam, New Year'ss Day. 1964. You meet me there... Now you got that? 
She nods, bewildered. The helicopter is landing. He grabs a discarded fender off the truck, hangs it over his arm like a shield and runs to the Cadillac, exchanging shots with a State Trooper who has arrived in the helicopter. The Trooper is hit and falls. Kit jumps in the car and roars off. Holly surrenders herself to the pilot of the helicopter and is taken off. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
Kit pulls into a gas station. He gets out of his car and drums on the roof. 
KIT Hey, anybody here? 
An ATTENDANT walks out the door. 
KIT Hi... Say,, you got any shells for a Savage, a .300 Savage? 
ATTENDANT Nope. 
KIT Damn. I pissed all mine away shooting up bottles... You want to fill her up for me? Please? 
The Attendant nods. Kit pulls Holly's suitcase out of the back seat and walks over to a trash can at the edge of the apron. Kit throws Holly's things methodically into the trash can. After a while he comes upon a book. He opens the book and looks through it, then turns to find the Attendant staring at him. As he gets to his feet. he nods at the trash can. 
KIT If you want any of that junk, it's yours. 
Meanwhile, a police car approaches the station. Kit sees it at about the same time the police see him. He throws his book in the car and roars out of the station. The police car goes into a bootlegger's turn and takes off after him.

CLARE (shrugs) Just basic manners. What it takes most men a lifetime to learn... Tyki's accomplished in two weeks. (introduces Scraggy) This is our guide, Scraggy Brier... and Miss Bets-- 
Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS. 
EXT. COMPOOND 
Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for help. 
INT. CAGE 
Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma. 
CLARE It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De Banana Peel. 
Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the pygmy's shoulder. 
INDIANA Where did you find him?... 
CLARE About ten miles from here. We were on a photographic expedition...in the thick of the jungle... I heard sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took a few steps, and found Tyki. He was lying in a shallow swamp...semi conscious...a high fever...nearly dead from exhaustion. He had obviously been travelling on foot for many days, over countless miles... So I brought him back to the compound...nursed him back to health... 
Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face. 
INDIANA Clare, I hate to quibble with your anthropological abilities... 
CLARE Quibble. 
INDIANA ...but if this little fellow is over 200 years old... I mean... What accounts for his youthful appearance?...his vitality?... 
Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the ground. Still WRESTLING. 
CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE. 
A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface. 
CLARE (O.S.) Tyki was wearing this when I found him. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED. 
CUT TO: 
SGT. GUTTERBUHG. 
He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation. 
CLARE (O.S.) Dr. Jones, you are obviously familiar with the legend of Sun Wu- King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?... 
INDIANA (O.S.) A bite from the fruit of that peach tree would give a person eternal life...make them forever young... 
The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG". 
CUT BACK TO: 
INDIANA 
STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around Indiana's head. 
INDIANA There's nothing unusual about this ...nothing to indicate that it's from Sun Wu Kung's garden... 
The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS. 
CLARE This fruit fly had a normal life- span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS. (frustrated sigh) As an experiment...the fly was put in this room...alone...with only the peach stone to sustain its existence. The fly stayed alive for THREE WEEKS. (looks at dead fly) Until now. 
She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG. 
INDIANA Sorry. 
Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room. 
INT. CAGE 
Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy, giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana. 
CLARE He understands him? 
INDIANA (nods) Scraggy knows hundreds of languages... He's the best guide in Africa. (turns to Scraggy) Ask Tyki where he came from. 
Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES. 
SCRAGGY He say... "I come from 'Land Of City On Clouds'". 
INDIANA (puzzled) Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed to mean? (to Scraggy) Can he take us there?

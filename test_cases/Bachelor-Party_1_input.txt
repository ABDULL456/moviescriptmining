COLE She's mine! 
He drives off. 
RICK He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus! 
They all board the bus. 
EXT. CITY STREET 
As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship. 
INT. PORSCHE 
COLE Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. 
He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs OUT OF FRAME. 
EXT. CITY STREET 
A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely placing orange cones in the center line of the road. 
Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed. 
INT. RICK'S BUS 
Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over. 
MAINTENANCE TRUCK 
Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught up with Cole. 
EXT. STREET 
The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles back into the parking lot. 
EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT 
Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into the theater entrance. 
Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out of the bus. 
COLE He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. 
RICK Fan out and look for them. 
They all go running into various theaters. 
ANGLE - RYKO 
He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie playing inside. 
RYKO Aw, I've seen this one already. 
Rick chooses a theater and goes inside. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER 
The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. He gives chase and catches up with Cole. 
He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. 
A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth. 
MAN (to LADY next to him) Gee, what a realistic effect. 
WOMAN Yeah, like you're in the movie with them. 
Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle. 
PATRON (to his date) Best 3D I've ever seen. 
As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging him out of the theater. 
INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER 
Rick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. Debbie comes running behind Rick. 
RICK (to Debbie) Are you okay? 
DEBBIE Yeah. 
RICK This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?

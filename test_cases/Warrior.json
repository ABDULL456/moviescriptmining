{"train": "WARRIOR \nWritten by \nGavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis & Cliff Dorfman \nEXT. PITTSBURGH, PA - TWILIGHT \nA beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges. Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh. \nEXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME \nPADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes. \nEXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER \nPaddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He listens to \"MOBY DICK\" on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view, Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue- collar neighborhood high above the city. \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME \nTOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the approaching night. \nEXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nPaddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his eyes. \nPADDY Tommy? \nTommy gives a drunken, crooked smile. \nPADDY (CONT'D) What're you doing here? \nTOMMY I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man. \nFather and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) She looks good. \nPADDY (patting car hood) Yeah, she's hanging in there. \nTOMMY Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities. \nPaddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed. \nPADDY She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy. \nTOMMY What? You change brands? \nPaddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not drinking? What gives? \nPADDY C'mon, let's go inside. \nPaddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused Tommy follows. \nTITLE CARD: WARRIOR \nINT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen. \nTOMMY I like what you've done with the place. \nPADDY (O.S.) Appreciate that. \nThe sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair. \nSTEPHON How many laws this dude got? \nBRENDAN (LAUGHING) The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. \nBrendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and- white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class... \nBrendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) ...and tell her posse outside to beat it... \nHe turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance. \nKC Mr. C, I put it away. \nThe class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings. \nBRENDAN Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY \nFenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer. Watches \"MMA LIVE\" and another feature on the big upcoming Sparta tournament. \nTommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s), is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important. \nIn the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as Mad Dog laughs. \nMAD DOG Where do you find these girls? \nColt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter. Glances at Mad Dog. \nCOLT BOYD We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? (TO FENROY) Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks. \nTOMMY Yo, I'll fight him. \nColt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring. \nCOLT BOYD Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk. \nTommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's outfit. \nMAD DOG Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? \nTommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches. \nFENROY (TO COLT) His phone's disconnected. \nCOLT BOYD Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones. \nTOMMY (TO COLT) All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you. \nColt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral. \nCOLT BOYD You ever fought before? \nTOMMY Yeah. \nColt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in. \nCOLT BOYD (TO FENROY) This guy sign a waiver? \nFENROY All good. \nCOLT BOYD What's your name? \nBRENDAN That's not how I do things. \nDAN TAYLOR Well, then you're looking at foreclosure. \nBrendan gets up and storms out of the office. \nANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Utter domination by Tommy Conlon, the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh... \nINT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads: 1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY. \nON TV SCREEN: 14-YEAR-OLD TOMMY DOMINATES AN OPPONENT. \nANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) ...the prodigy has yet to yield a single point in the entire tournament. It's just unprecedented. \nANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) Tommy trained by his father since the age of five. \nANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) You're talking about Paddy Conlon. \nANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) The controversial Paddy Conlon. \nON TV SCREEN: A YOUNGER PADDY SHOUTS INSTRUCTIONS AS TOMMY CRUSHES HIS OPPONENT. \nANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Say what you will about the methods of the former Marine, but he's led his son to six straight junior Olympic titles, and now just moments away from a high school state championship. And there it is! Wow! \nON TV SCREEN: TOMMY PINS HIS OPPONENT AND LEAPS OFF THE MAT IN JUBILATION. \nANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.) There's just no limit to what the future holds for this kid! \nAs Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the door as the tape continues to play. \nANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.) Tommy told me that he's chasing the record of Theogenes, apparently a mythical Greek fighter said to be unbeaten in over 1400 bouts... \nPaddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop. \nCOLT BOYD How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan. \nPaddy registers the name \"Riordan.\" \nPADDY Who? \nCOLT BOYD Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd. \nPADDY What business you got with Tommy? \nCOLT BOYD None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters. \nColt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come. \nCOLT BOYD (CONT'D) Tommy's been working out at my gym. He put a beating on the number one middleweight contender in the world today. I want to know more about the guy. Maybe help him out. I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan. \nPADDY Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. \nCOLT BOYD I'm just looking for some general information here. \nPADDY Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself. \nCOLT BOYD Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym. \nPADDY He doesn't live here. \nPaddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt. \nINT. BRENDAN'S CAR - NIGHT \nBrendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and talks on his cell. \nBRENDAN I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing. \nTess can't believe what she's hearing. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) They're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out OF OPTIONS-- \nTESS (FURIOUS) Then they'll put us out of the house in three months. I'd rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again. (BEAT) I thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living. \nBRENDAN We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going BACKWARDS \nTess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself down. Embraces her husband. \nTESS We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to. \nEXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING \nA steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the shadow of the railroad tracks. \nINT. DINER - SAME \nPaddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich, he's been there a while. \nThe front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him. \nPADDY You wanted to talk? \nTOMMY Yeah. (BEAT) I'm gonna start fighting. \nPADDY That right? \nTOMMY Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you. \nPADDY Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy. \nTOMMY We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did. \nTommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Alright. Look. There's this tournament. A big tournament. Top sixteen middleweights in the world. Single elimination. Winner take all for a lot of money. I'm gonna do that. But if I'm doin' it, then I'm gonna need a trainer. Now that much you were good at. (off Paddy grinning) No, no, no. This doesn't mean anything. \nPaddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at him sternly. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) I'm serious. We train. That's it. I don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? You wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the VFW. You can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays. \nPADDY What about Colt Boyd? \nTOMMY What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know. \nPADDY Ah, the devil you know. \nTOMMY Excuse me? \nPADDY The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. \nTommy looks at him. Grins for the first time. \nPADDY (CONT'D) Chasing Theogenes. It'll be kinda like old times. \nTOMMY (ANGRY) I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking. \nPaddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left. \nPADDY Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em. \nTommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy away. \nPADDY (CONT'D) In fact, hand `em over right now. (BEAT) I know they're on you, Tommy. You sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door. \nZito looks at Brendan. Puzzled. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) I fought for a living. (BEAT) Guess I forgot to put that down on my application. \nJOE ZITO Yeah, I guess you did. \nZito sits back down. \nBRENDAN Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just-- \nJOE ZITO Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs. \nBRENDAN It was the parking lot of a strip club. \nJOE ZITO Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here. \nZito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his office. He's looking none too pleased. \nJOE ZITO (CONT'D) This is a serious problem. (BEAT) Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11. \nBRENDAN What are we gonna do? \nJOE ZITO You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood. \nBrendan and Joe stand up. Zito can't tether down a slight grin. \nJOE ZITO (CONT'D) UFC? \nBrendan nods. Joe shakes his head. Impressed. \nJOE ZITO (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. \nINT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - KID'S PLAYROOM - NIGHT \nBrendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom, putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom. They speak in whispers. \nTESS What are you doing? \nBRENDAN (OFF PIANO) The girls have an important piano recital in the morning. Got an equipment malfunction. (BEAT) How'd it go? \nTESS They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his attorney. \nBRENDAN How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney? \nTess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the floor. \nTESS He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe. \nBRENDAN That was nice. \nTESS He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next semester. \nBRENDAN Next semester? \nTess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions. Finally, Brendan speaks up. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Look, Tess. They have these smoker fights all over. There's one in Lancaster next week. There's two in Dover the week after. Wilmington. Camden. Baltimore. It could keep us afloat. \nTESS You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop? \nBRENDAN Some of them pay a little more than that. (BEAT) I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night. \nBrendan looks at his wife. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) And these guys, they're not real fighters. They're just guys who have seen too much UFC on TV. If you have a better solution, I'm all ears. \nTess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options. \nAV What tape? \nBRADFORD The tape. \nAV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for, loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY. \nON VIDEO SCREEN: A CHAOTIC FIRE FIGHT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. MUZZLE FLASHES. TRACER LIGHTS. MAYHEM. THE CAMERA FOCUSES ON A FLIPPED TANK, HALF OF IT SUBMERGED IN WATER. A MARINE, HEAD SHAVED BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY TOMMY, SUDDENLY APPEARS AND CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE TANK, REACHING FOR THE HATCH. \nBRADFORD Freeze. \nAV holds the \"Pause\" button down as Bradford looks at the screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy. \nBRADFORD (CONT'D) That's him. That's him. \nINT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY \nIn a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS. The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air. \nFRANK Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe. \nAs Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great trainer notices him and walks over. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Do I know you? I think I know you. \nThey embrace warmly. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Long time, brother. \nBRENDAN Liking the place, Frank. \nFRANK Thank you, brother. (off Brazilian fighter) You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta. \nBRENDAN Amazing, man. \nFRANK Come on back. \nThe two head for the offices at the back of the gym. \nINT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini- fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down. \nFRANK You look good, brother. How're the girls? \nBRENDAN Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie. \nFRANK I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called. \nBRENDAN It's alright. \nFRANK No, Brendan. I'm sorry. \nBRENDAN It's all good. She's good now. \nFrank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly. \nFRANK It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good? \nBRENDAN Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually. \nFrank considers what he's hearing. \nFRANK I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need? \nBRENDAN I didn't come here for a loan, Frank. (BEAT) I was hoping you'd train me. \nFRANK Train you for what? \nPADDY Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you? \nBRENDAN I'm going inside. \nPADDY I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today. \nBRENDAN Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything. \nPADDY What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan. \nPaddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely. \nBRENDAN You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do. \nPADDY C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication. \nBRENDAN You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is. \nPADDY I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met. \nBRENDAN Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that? \nPaddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) That shit you pulled. Never again. And all the shit I saw growing up? That doesn't happen here. \nBrendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on his face. Then he heads for the house. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Take care of yourself. \nAs he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out. \nPADDY Tommy's back. \nBrendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad. \nPADDY (CONT'D) He's in the `Burgh. \nBRENDAN Tommy's in Pittsburgh? \nPADDY He came to see me. \nBRENDAN He came to see you? \nPADDY He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore. \nBrendan walks closer. Incredulous. \nBRENDAN You and Tommy are training together? \nPaddy nods. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Tommy Conlon. \nPADDY Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now. \nBRENDAN I know what her name is. \nPADDY I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here. \nBRENDAN I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days? \nPADDY That too. \nBrendan looks at him. Considers. \nBRENDAN Did he say if he wants to see me? \nTommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to crease his lips. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTommy pulls a crumpled PIECE OF PAPER out of a beat-up wallet and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall. \nINT. PILAR FERNANDEZ'S HOUSE, EL PASO, TEXAS - SAME \nMore of a shack than a house. PILAR FERNANDEZ (20s), a pretty but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year- old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi desert. \nINTERCUT TOMMY AND PILAR \nPILAR Bueno? \nTOMMY Pilar. It's Tommy. \nPILAR Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe it! How are you? \nTOMMY Good good. How you doin'? \nPILAR OK. You know me, Tommy. (BEAT) I was getting really worried about you. \nTOMMY How're things? Kids are good? \nPILAR They're good. Maria's getting so big. She looks more like Manny every day. \nTOMMY How's little man? \nPILAR He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy. Takes care of his sister. He's a great kid. Everyone's good. \nTOMMY You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys. \nPILAR Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know Manny would really appreciate it. You worry too much. It's OK. We're hanging in there. \nBEGIN TRAINING MONTAGE BEGINS \nEXT. P.J. MCARDLE BRIDGE, PITTSBURGH - PRE-DAWN \nTommy, hoodie up, runs in the darkness as Paddy's Olds trails behind him, the SOUND of \"Moby Dick\" playing in the car. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY \nFrank watches as a team of FIGHTERS races up a steep hill. Marco is ahead of the pack, Brendan in the middle. \nEXT. 33RD STREET RAIL YARD - MORNING \nTommy runs hard through an industrial area along the Allegheny River. The sky, the steel, the bridges, everything's hard and gray. \nINT. MARINES COMMUNICATIONS TENT, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY \nBradford and other Marines watch \"MMA LIVE\" on a laptop. \nON COMPUTER SCREEN: J.J. RILEY BEING INTERVIEWED BY JON ANIK VIA SATELLITE FROM TOKYO. \nJON ANIK (ON SCREEN) With eight weeks left til Sparta, J.J. Riley and the TapOut crew take time out of their international press tour to join us. (MORE) \nJON ANIK (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) J.J., we've never seen this kind of Grand Prix tournament in the country before. Tell us, why the unique format? \nJ.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN) Well, Jon, you know as well as anyone that in Mixed Martial Arts, anyone can beat anyone on a given night... \nEXT. PARKING LOT, SCRANTON PA - NIGHT \nBrendan takes steady blows from an OPPONENT in another smoker, then turns the tables, slams his man down, and chokes him out. His skills are improving. \nJ.J. RILEY (V.O.) ...but with this type of format, it's gonna be tough to deny who the champion is. \nEXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - MORNING \nFRANK (V.O.) You've gotta relax and stay calm in there. The cage is your home. You set the pace. \nINT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY \nBrendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank looks on, impressed by Brendan. \nFRANK (V.O.) You set the rhythm. Feel the Beethoven. Be smarter than him. More patient. Wait for him to make a mistake. And when he does, that's your moment. \nBrendan turns Marco and gets him in a knee bar. Marco has nowhere to go and is forced to TAP. Frank jumps in the ring, all smiles, and slaps Brendan on the chest. \nFRANK No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son. \nEXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - DAY \nTommy keeps pushing the giant tires until he finally reaches the end of the yard. He's ready. \nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY \nFrank, Brendan, and group of other FIGHTERS stand at the bottom of the hill and tend to Marco Santos, who has just badly INJURED HIS KNEE. \nEND OF TRAINING MONTAGE \nEXT. ST. IGNATIUS HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nAn AMBULANCE pulls in front of the ER. \nINT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATER \nA sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking garage with Brendan. \nBRENDAN You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite? \nFRANK Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow. \nFrank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car, stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward him. \nBRENDAN Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me? \nBrendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco. \nFRANK You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow. \nBRENDAN It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do. \nFrank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) They'll have to kill me to get me out of that cage. \nFRANK That's what I'm afraid of. \nBRENDAN Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you. \nFRANK You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us? \nBRENDAN That's not gonna happen. \nFRANK Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that. \nBRENDAN (SMILING) It's not gonna happen. \nFrank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no? \nFRANK I'll make a call. \nBrendan grins and walks back toward his car. \nBRENDAN I love my coach! \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME \nAs WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments later, Brendan comes walking through the doors. \nAs he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make eye contact. \nThey haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each other today. Paddy is just as shocked. \nBrendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside. \nFRANK Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me. \nBrendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him. \nEXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - TWILIGHT \nThe sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic City, and sinks into the sea. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME \nPaddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to \"Moby Dick\" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground. \nON TV SCREEN: LOCAL NEW JERSEY NEWS ANCHOR MICHELLE MOONEY SPEAKS OVER IMAGES OF THE RED CARPET EVENT AND PRESS CONFERENCE. \nMICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) ...the only fighter missing from the event was dark horse entry Tommy Riordan. \nON TV SCREEN: A PICTURE OF TOMMY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NEXT TO A PICTURE OF LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD. \nPaddy notices the picture of Tommy. Puts down the program and takes his headphones off. \nMICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Recent revelations that Riordan was not only a United States Marine but a hero in the Iraq War, has cast an even brighter spotlight on a fighter who seems to have come out of nowhere. (MORE) \nMICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) Lance Corporal Mark Bradford's web testimony to Riordan, who saved his life earlier this year in Iraq, is spreading like wildfire throughout the media. \nPaddy stares at the screen intently. \nPADDY Tommy! \nON TV SCREEN: MARK BRADFORD PEERS INTO A HAND-HELD CAMERA IN IRAQ AND SPEAKS. HE FIGHT BACK TEARS. \nBRADFORD (ON SCREEN) ...the bridge just crumbled. The Amtrack was upside down. Water was coming in from everywhere. The water pressure was too much. We couldn't get the back hatch open. \nON TV SCREEN: BRADFORD HAS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF. \nBRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) We were all drowning, man. It was a death trap. \nTommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite and stares at the TV. \nBRADFORD (ON SCREEN) (CONT'D) I couldn't have had more than another minute. Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off, and there he was. Before I could get out and thank him, he was gone. He just vanished like a ghost. \nPaddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him and back at the TV before heading toward the door. \nTOMMY I'm takin' a walk. \nON TV SCREEN: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON BRADFORD'S FACE. HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO TOMMY. \nBRADFORD (ON SCREEN) You saved my life, brother. Anybody seeing this at Sparta, anybody out in Pittsburgh, reach out to Tommy Riordan. Tell him Mark said thank you. \nON SCREEN: BACK TO THE NEWS STUDIO, AND THE PHOTO OF TOMMY. \nMICHELLE MOONEY (ON SCREEN) Footage taken from a helmet camera on the ground captured the heroic incident... \nON SCREEN: THE GRAINY FOOTAGE SEEN EARLIER IN THE MARINE BARRACKS OF TOMMY AND THE SUBMERGED TANK. \nThen the phone RINGS. Paddy grabs it. \nPADDY (INTO PHONE) Hello? (BEAT) Brendan. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Great story, but I think your boy is about to be exposed as a YouTube sensation. \nON TV SCREEN: REFEREE JOSH ROSENTHAL (30s) GIVES INSTRUCTIONS TO TOMMY AND HIS OPPONENT, FRANCISCO BARBOSA (20s). THE MUSCULAR BRAZILIAN DOESN'T HAVE A TRACE OF FEAR ON HIS FACE. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nTommy and Barbosa face to face as JOSH ROSENTHAL instructs. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. \nIn the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give him some advice, but Tommy is not listening. \nCALLEN (V.O.) We're about to get the big answer to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real? And here we go! \nThe bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Barbosa's gonna be looking for a take down. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Definitely gonna be looking for a take down. \nThere will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying, and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Barbosa is down! Barbosa has been knocked out! Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real! \nAs the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage without waiting for an official announcement. \nCALLEN (V.O.) And now he's walking out of the cage! He's leaving the cage! There goes another rule out the window! \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME \nFenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the ferocious knockout they've just witnessed. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Francisco Barbosa is out cold, and he is out of this tournament, Bryan. \nINT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nThe official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank and a nervous Brendan sit alone. \nOFFICIAL Show time. \nOn the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders. \nFRANK You can do this. \nHe grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands. \nFRANK (CONT'D) I want to hear you say it. \nBRENDAN I can do this. \nFRANK Then let's go do this. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nBUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours to fill Marco Santos' spot, and he basically had to rely on the word of Frank Campana. \nCALLEN (V.O.) And he chose Brendan Conlon, which quite frankly is something I just don't understand. \nBrendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena, where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck. Brendan notices the old man as he approaches. \nPADDY Go get `em, son. \nBrendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank looks at Brendan with a \"Who the hell is that?\" expression. As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers. \nCALLEN (V.O.) I can understand coming out to no music, by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance? \nFrank exhorts Brendan from cageside, telling him to relax, but it's no use. It's an unholy beating going in the cage. \nINT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME \nZito drinks a glass of Scotch. \nON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT POUNDING ON BRENDAN. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Midnight is all over Brendan. \nCALLEN (V.O.) This can't last much longer. This won't last much longer. The teacher just has no answers. \nZito leans forward. He looks as if he's going to have a heart attack. \nZITO C'mon, Brendan, get outta there! \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nMidnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps. \nFRANK Get out of there! Get out of there! \nBrendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him. No use. \nCALLEN (V.O.) And now he's got the hooks in. 20 seconds left. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) The end is near. Can he make it to the end of the round is the question. \nMidnight squeezes for all it's worth as Frank screams at Brendan, imploring him not to tap. \nCALLEN (V.O.) 10 seconds left, and Brendan's face is turning purple. Conlon's whole world is about to go from day to night. \nBrendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight Le, who slams the canvas in frustration. \nAs Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a smiling Frank. \nFRANK Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him! \nBrendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan. \nINT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe frazzled Zito continues to root for Brendan. \nON TV SCREEN: MORE OF THE SAME. MIDNIGHT ALL OVER BRENDAN. \nINT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nAn excited Paddy watches Brendan on the monitor. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nMidnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of encouragement as the battle continues. \nBack and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the ground. The crowd is on its collective feet. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) He's got a Kimura locked in. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Are you kidding me? \nBrendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on how to finish the move. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Midnight is in big trouble! \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) I don't think he's got anywhere to go! \nCALLEN (V.O.) This isn't happening! This can't happen! \nINT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nBrendan and Frank stare at a monitor. They look worried. \nON TV SCREEN: KOBA's OPPONENT GETTING ATTENDED TO AFTER THE BEATING BY THE MIGHTY RUSSIAN. \nINT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - LATER \nTommy and Paddy sit on stools opposite each other, Paddy taping him up. Tommy keeps a lazy eye on a monitor, where Mad Dog Grimes is fighting. \nON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, HIS MOHAWK DYED PLATINUM, KNOCKS OUT HIS OPPONENT IN BRUTAL FASHION. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed. Like a man with something to prove. \nON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG MAKES A THROAT SLIT GESTURE DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERA. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Mad Dog said he had a message for Tommy Riordan and there it is right there. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - LATER \nBrendan and Frank stand in the tunnel as the house lights go down in the arena. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon. \nCALLEN (V.O.) The teacher miraculously passed his first test, but now he's gotta face The Dane. \nPaddy stands amidst the crowd in the tunnel and gives Brendan a thumbs-up. \nPADDY You can do it, Brendan. \nBrendan glares at him and marches toward the cage. \nINT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER \nTess, now watching the fights on TV, stands in front of the screen and bites her nails. She looks like she's about to throw up. \nON TV SCREEN: BRENDAN TAKES A BEATING FROM KARL \"THE DANE\" KRULLER (30s), WHO POUNDS ON HIM WITHOUT MERCY. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Halfway through round three now and the beating continues. \nCALLEN (V.O.) I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon is still standing, Sam. (MORE) \nCALLEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) He has been absolutely battered in both his fights tonight. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nKARL \"THE DANE\" KRULLER presses Brendan against the fence and knees him repeatedly in the midsection. \nINT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME \nTess can barely watch the beating. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nFrank shouts instructions as Brendan and The Dane tangle against the fence. \nFRANK Take him down! \nBrendan grabs Kruller and FLIPS him to the canvas. Then he spins for an ARM BAR, a move similar to one seen earlier in the smoker fights. \nINT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME \nZito, now joined by his wife. Both on the edge of the couch and sucked into the action. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nBrendan twists Kruller's arm. He's got him in a terrible position, much like Midnight. The Dane SQUIRMs. Looks for an escape. It's not there. With Brendan applying tremendous pressure to his arm, he TAPS. \nTommy marches past Paddy again, then off through the crowd. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan marching through the crowd, and straight into the final four! \nThe arena is on its collective feet CHANTING \"Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!\" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades. \nEXT. BOARDWALK - DAWN \nDawn breaks over Atlantic City. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME \nA CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens. Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines. \nFrom a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who doesn't acknowledge him. \nPADDY Can't sleep, huh? \nTommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy. \nPADDY (CONT'D) I know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but I'm proud of you. What you did for that kid in the tank? That was really something. \nTOMMY How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown? \nPADDY No. (BEAT) What'd you do? \nTOMMY What'd I do? I took off. \nPaddy starts putting things together. \nPADDY That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records. \nTommy doesn't respond. \nPADDY (CONT'D) What the hell happened over there, Tommy? \nTOMMY That is none of your business. \nPADDY Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand. \nTOMMY Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit. \nPADDY I'm really trying here, Tommy. \nTOMMY You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. \nPaddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man. \nTommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with QUARTERS. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? (MORE) \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here. (BEAT) Get the fuck outta here! \nTommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his slot machine as his destroyed father limps away. \nEXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY \nFourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME \nPaddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck, clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. \"Moby Dick\" plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off. LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen off the wagon. Hard. \nPADDY God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards! \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER \nThe crowd at the gym both CHEERS and JEERS at the TV. \nON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, SUPREMELY CONFIDENT, CLIMBS INTO THE CAGE AND GETS IN TOMMY'S FACE. HE HAS DYED HIS MOHAWK CAMOUFLAGE COLORS TO MOCK TOMMY. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for revenge ever since the day Tommy Riordan walked into his gym in Pittsburgh and turned his life upside down. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) It's been a very long, very miserable few months for Mad Dog to say the least. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nMad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is rooting for Tommy. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it. \nThe Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes over his instructions with the two fighters. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. \nIn the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less intimidated. \nMAD DOG It's not gonna happen again. \nCallen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog predicted an early knockout. Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Let's see what Tommy has to say about that. \nJosh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! \nCALLEN (V.O.) And they are off! \nTommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth. What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in restraint compared to what's happening in that cage. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy tackles him and he's on top! He's raining blows! \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Someone has to stop this. \nMad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside, Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal. \nCOLT BOYD Stop it! Stop the fight! \nIt's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. Beaten to an absolute pulp. \nCALLEN (V.O.) That's the fastest knockout I think I've ever seen. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. He is not moving. \nTommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass, and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed. Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a MEDIC tends to Mad Dog. \nCALLEN (V.O.) I'll tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key! Break out the yellow tape, Sam. Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER \n\"ODE TO JOY\" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot. \nPull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN, Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC, Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B. \nAs the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME \nBrendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the crowd. They're completely on his side now. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! \nKoba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Uh oh, Brendan's going for ride! \nCALLEN (V.O.) That one shook the entire building! \nAs Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the fight, the HORN sounds. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Everyone has gotta be concerned about Brendan Conlon's bravery getting him into trouble here. \nCALLEN (V.O.) His bravery can get him killed, Sam. He's got nothing more to prove. He's already lasted two rounds against Koba, which is more than anyone else can say. You wonder what's keeping this guy up. \nBrendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool. Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone. He comes at Brendan with aggression instead. \nFRANK Sit down. Breathe. (grabbing Brendan's face) Look at me! Look at me! Why are we here, Brendan? Why are we here? Are we here to win this fight? You tell me, `cause if we're not, I'll throw in the towel right now. We'll get Tess and we will go home. You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home. \nJosh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave, but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! \nBrendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage, but the Russian resumes his supremacy. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Conlon somehow answering the bell for round three, but Koba's all over him again. \nKoba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg kicks. A decent punch or two. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Brendan's giving back, Bryan. There are signs of life in Brendan Conlon. He's starting to mix it up! \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER \nThe parking lot is quiet and tense. Zito and the kids stare at the movie screen. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: KOBA PRESSES BRENDAN UP AGAINST THE CAGE AND TRIES TO CHOKE HIM OUT. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nThe Russian SQUEEZES away. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Koba's got him caught in an iron vice, squeezing for all it's worth and trying to choke the teacher out. \nFrank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back, freeing himself from the choke in the process. \nCALLEN (V.O.) He just launched Koba! Can you believe this? Conlon just shook off a guillotine! \nBrendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Conlon's staying after him! He's squeezing him! The tables have turned, and the boy scout is squeezing the bear! \nKoba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands. Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Conlon standing and trading with the Russian! I've never seen this! \nCALLEN (V.O.) This is a fight! We've got ourselves a fight! \nBrendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Conlon going for a knee bar! He's got it very deep! \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) He's deep on that knee bar! \nBrendan wrenches his body for all it's worth. Frank pounds on the apron of the cage. \nFRANK Crank it! Crank it! \nThe Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's only 10 seconds left in the fight. \nBRENDAN I'm gonna fight him. \nINT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nTommy sits by himself in his locker room, the weight of the world pulling his shoulders down. His black hoodie is over his head. He couldn't be more alone. \nEXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - SAME \nA sobered up Paddy runs out of the hotel and climbs into a waiting taxi. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nBrendan and Frank make the long walk down the tunnel and into the arena. Unlike previous trips, there is no joy on their faces. It's a grim march to the cage. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nPeople stand on cars. Chairs. Each other's shoulders. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: THE BATTERED BRENDAN CONTINUES HIS WALK, WADING THROUGH A CROWD THAT IS AS PUMPED AS HE IS SOMBER. \nTito, KC, Nash, Stephon, and the other students start chanting \"Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C!\" \nINT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nTommy rises and walks toward the door. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS \nHe marches out the door and into the bowels of the arena, moving past MPS as he goes. His march is as grim as Brendan's. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nBrendan and Frank embrace. \nFRANK One more time. \nBrendan climbs into the cage as the house LIGHTS DIM. The crowd is going bonkers. And they EXPLODE when Tommy appears at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his march toward the cage. \nThe Marines shower him with cheers and \"Hoo-ahs.\" The girls scream. The rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants his name. But he acknowledges no one, and the hard look on his face never wavers. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER \nFenroy and the crew on the edge of their seats, all staring at the big screen. \nON TV SCREEN: TOMMY GETTING GREASED UP AND CLIMBING INTO THE CAGE. \nINT. TAXI - SAME \nA nervous Paddy sits in the back of the cab as the DRIVER navigates through holiday traffic. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nAnd here it is. The two brothers face to face in the middle of the ring, staring each other down. Tommy with his usual controlled fire, Brendan intense, searching his brother's eyes for some flicker of recognition. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, this is the final. Five rounds. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. \nAs Rosenthal finishes his instructions, Brendan peers into Tommy's empty corner. \nBRENDAN Where's Pop? \nTommy turns without answering. All business. Brendan returns to his corner. Looks at Tess. So much emotion on her face. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, are you ready? Are you ready? Let's go to war! \nTommy comes right after his brother. Just like with his previous three opponents. A natural wrecking machine. Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him, POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other fights were for Brendan, this one is worse. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \n", "test1_input": "Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. \nAn overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out. \nPaddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son. Relieved and heartbroken at the same time. \nEXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nA chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY. \nTESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA. She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up. \nTHROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN. \nTESS What's going on here? \nBRENDAN Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess. \nTess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a \"Help me out here\" expression. \nTESS Em, you want to open your presents? \nThe make-over ends abruptly at the mention of \"presents.\" Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around. \nBrendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest. \nTESS (CONT'D) (off pink box) This an awfully big box. \nBRENDAN It's her birthday. \nTess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera. \nTESS (TEASING) I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge. \nBrendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife. \nEXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set. \nShe walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan pressing free weights on an old bench. \nINT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nBrendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make- up, is visible on his cheek. \nTESS Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath. \nBRENDAN I'm on it. \nTESS Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're exhausted. \nBrendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit. \nBRENDAN Where's the rest of that skirt? \nTESS Babe. \nBRENDAN Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay? \nTESS (off his cut) Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face. \nBRENDAN I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action. \nTESS Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that. \n", "test1_true": "BRENDAN Promises, promises. \nINT.

Sun slants through a dirty, industrial skylight. A no frills kind of gym. \nBehind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and watches ESPN's \"MMA LIVE\" on a laptop. \nON COMPUTER SCREEN: ESPN ANCHOR JON ANIK INTERVIEWS PROMOTER J.J. RILEY, AND PUNKASS AND SKYSKRAPE FROM TAPOUT. \nJON ANIK (ON SCREEN) And we return here on MMA Live, Jon Anik alongside billionaire fight promoter J.J. Riley. The Tapout crew is also here. Punk and Skrape are in the building. Now J.J., what led to this project that is redefining Mixed Martial Arts here in the States? \nJ.J. RILEY (ON SCREEN) Well, Mixed Martial Arts is a sport that I've always been incredibly passionate about. As for where the idea for Sparta came from, I've always kind of dug the Grand Prix format, so I tracked these guys down to help me out. \nPUNKASS (ON SCREEN) When J.J. came to us he said he wanted to create the Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts. \nSKRAPE (ON SCREEN) And he decided to put up the five million dollar purse, too. \nJON ANIK (ON SCREEN) Well, there you have it. It shall be done. Hedge fund king J.J. Riley, going from the lion's den of Wall Street to the cage, promoting the biggest winner-take-all tournament in MMA history. Sparta. \nAs Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with curiosity, and approaches the front desk. \nTOMMY Fitzy still own this? \nFENROY Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns this gym. \nFenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: \"THE WAR ON THE SHORE. ATLANTIC CITY, JULY 2-3. BIGGEST WINNER TAKE ALL IN MMA HISTORY!\" \nFENROY (CONT'D) Can I help you with something? \nTOMMY How's it work here? \nFENROY Thirty five a month with locker. We're open at 7, lights out at 11. You wanna join? \nTOMMY Sure. \nFenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the counter in front of Tommy. \nFENROY Put your name and contact info on the card. \nINT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nBrendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates CHEER him on. \nBRENDAN Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs-- \nTITO Acceleration. \nBRENDAN Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead. \nBrendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face, watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and leans the bat against a blackboard with \"NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF MOTION\" printed on it. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) There we go. Alright Tito, well done. Remind not to mess with you. Sit down everybody. Dial it down. \nAs Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things settle down and the kids take their seats. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) So, have we got it? \nA room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out. \nNASH Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it. \nBRENDAN Alright. The third law-- \nA black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk. \n", "test1_id": 6, "test2_input": "TOMMY Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness. \nBRENDAN That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them. \nTommy smirks. Walks away again. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) But I forgave Pop. Just like I forgave you and Mom. \nTOMMY (TURNING AROUND) You forgave us? \nBRENDAN Yeah. \nTOMMY I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones. \nBRENDAN I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do? \nTOMMY You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me. \nThe words hit Brendan hard. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Hey, I'm glad you stayed and everything worked out for you, Brendan. See, you leave, you get the opposite. You leave, you get to bury people. \nBRENDAN You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make! \nTOMMY You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit. \nTommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished? \nTommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity. Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say. Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach. \nEXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nSunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot. \nINT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY \nNash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around. After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand up and head into the Principal's office. \nINT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThe kids walk in. Zito looks up and shakes his head. \nJOE ZITO You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right? \nAll four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to something. \nSTEPHON We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta. \nTITO What do you say? \nJOE ZITO Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly? (BEAT) I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all. \nNASH But everyone wants to see it. \nKC The gym's the only place that's big enough. \nJOE ZITO It's never gonna happen. \nSTEPHON What if we get a petition? \nTITO Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it. \nNASH The power of democracy! \nJOE ZITO Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT \nThe Goodyear BLIMP, \"SPARTA IS HERE\" blinking on it, floats over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them. \nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a distance, the excitement and energy are palpable. \nCALLEN (V.O.) The roof is about to blow clean off Boardwalk Hall Arena! It might be Fourth of July weekend, but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans! This is Atlantic City! This is the War on the Shore! And this is what everyone has been waiting for! \nEnormous electronic BILLBOARDS flash outside of the giant seaside casinos. On one, Koba hangs off the side of a ferris wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a replication of the iconic \"King Kong\" movie scene. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet duking it out over a 24-hour period for the largest purse in Mixed Martial Arts history. In the town everyone knows from the game of Monopoly, we've got ourselves a winner-take-all affair. Buckle your seatbelts, roll the dice, and take riiiiide on the Reading. Sparta. Is. Here! \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME \nPlay by play announcer Sam Sheridan and color analyst Bryan Callen stand cageside. The arena is packed to capacity and buzzing with anticipation. \nCALLEN Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history. \nSHERIDAN Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen. \nCALLEN It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation... \nINT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME \nTommy lays on the ground near the showers, collecting his thoughts. As Paddy watches a TV monitor showing Callen and Sheridan, an OFFICIAL pokes his head into the locker room. \nOFFICIAL Five minutes, Paddy. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER \nFenroy and a group of FIGHTERS gather around a TV in the gym. A very fired up group. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived, because here comes Tommy Riordan. \nON TV SCREEN: A FURIOUS TOMMY MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE CRUSH OF INSANE SPECTATORS, PADDY DUCKING ALONG AT HIS SIDE. LIGHTS RICOCHET CHAOTICALLY AROUND THE ARENA. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME \nAs Tommy makes his way toward the cage and the strobe lights sweep over nearly 15,000 SCREAMING FANS, not one of them sitting. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan's captured the media's attention, but the question still remains: who is this guy? And more importantly, can he compete in this talent pool? Can he win? \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew who he was, and I've gotta say the fact that I don't know is strange. In an internet age where there are no secrets, this guy is a complete mystery. I can't find out anything about him. Tommy Riordan is officially Google proof. \nTommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight. \nCALLEN (V.O.) You gotta love this guy, Sam. No walk out music, no sponsors, no interviews. He skipped out on the press conference. Wouldn't have his picture take for the program. He's breaking every rule! \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) The only reason that Tommy is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym. \nCALLEN (V.O.) But the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video, which is even more stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes video. Let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven't seen it, and I don't know anyone who hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process, and then walked away without claiming a medal. He ripped the door off a tank! \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero, I'm not taking anything away from the guy. He's a very, very tough guy, Bryan, but the tank don't hit back. We've seen YouTube sensations fail on the big stage before. \nTommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone. \nCALLEN Sam. He ripped the door off a tank! \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nFrank holds mitts for Brendan as a TV plays. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan definitely has his hands full in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is nothing to scoff at. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Yeah, he's the real deal. Very tough guy. Very high caliber fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere, and I imagine he's going to disappear just as quickly. (MORE) \n", "test2_id": 7, "test3_input": "CALLEN (V.O.) He's doing it again! Conlon's doing it again! This is going to be over! \nBrendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in. \nBRENDAN Tap, Tommy! \nTommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact, he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Tap! \nThe shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the round. \nBrendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence, and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nThe crowd fired up by Brendan's comeback, and mesmerized by what's taking place in the cage between the brothers. It's complete and utter chaos in there. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY PACES IN HIS CORNER, HIS SHOULDER WRECKED. JOSH ROSENTHAL TRIES TO SEE IF HE'S ALRIGHT BUT TOMMY TURNS AWAY. HE'S NOT QUITTING AND NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL HIM HE HAS TO. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME \nSheer amazement that Tommy didn't submit. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nTommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him. \nFrank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water. Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his brother. \nBRENDAN I popped his shoulder. \nFRANK Relax, breathe. \nBRENDAN I heard it tear. \nFRANK You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder. \nThis is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh Rosenthal. \nBRENDAN Josh! \nFrank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face. \nFRANK Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him! \nRosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low. Brendan makes eye contact with him. \nBRENDAN Tommy! What are you doing? \nTOMMY Shut up! C'mon. \nBRENDAN What are you that crazy? \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! \nThe BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother. \nBRENDAN What are you doing? It's over! \nFrank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this. \nTommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him. Everything about him says \"Quit, Tommy.\" But Tommy won't. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - SAME \n", "test3_true": "EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nZito and the kids staring at the screen, imploring Brendan to take the helpless Tommy out and win the championship. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - SAME \nBrendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid. He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he doesn't do something. \nFRANK Finish him! You finish him! \nTommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally, with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him, blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it. \nBrendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls Brendan away. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Break! Break! \nBrendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet. \nFrom near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nThe crowd wants a victory. Tito and the boys start the \"Mis- ter C!\" chant again. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: FRANK ADMONISHES BRENDAN IN HIS CORNER. IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S TELLING HIM, BUT BRENDAN'S EYES ARE FAR AWAY. HE'S NOT LISTENING TO A WORD. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nTommy and Brendan stand for Round Five. Tommy's face is battered after Round Four and Brendan's face is ruined. \nIn the crowd, the \"Tommy\" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact, it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER \nAll eyes riveted to the screen, where the brothers circle each other as in the fourth round. \nON SCREEN: MORE PAINFUL STABBING JABS FROM TOMMY. BRENDAN GIVES HIM ONE LAST, LONG LOOK, BUT TOMMY RESPONDS BY KICKING HIM IN THE LEG. FINALLY, LEFT NO CHOICE, BRENDAN SWOOPS. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nBrendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen. \nAs an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him. \nBRENDAN I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry! \nTommy continues to struggle. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Tap, Tommy! Tap! \nTears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) I love you, Tommy! I love you! \nTommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting. \nEXT.

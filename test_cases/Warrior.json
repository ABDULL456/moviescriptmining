{"test1_input": "WARRIOR \nWritten by \nGavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis & Cliff Dorfman \nEXT. PITTSBURGH, PA - TWILIGHT \nA beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges. Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh. \nEXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME \nPADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes. \nEXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER \nPaddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He listens to \"MOBY DICK\" on tape as the last piece of daylight bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view, Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue- collar neighborhood high above the city. \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME \nTOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the approaching night. \nEXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nPaddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his eyes. \nPADDY Tommy? \nTommy gives a drunken, crooked smile. \nPADDY (CONT'D) What're you doing here? \nTOMMY I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man. \nFather and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) She looks good. \nPADDY (patting car hood) Yeah, she's hanging in there. \nTOMMY Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities. \nPaddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Got a little something for ya. Mom always said never go anywhere empty handed. \nPADDY She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy. \nTOMMY What? You change brands? \nPaddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not drinking? What gives? \nPADDY C'mon, let's go inside. \nPaddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a confused Tommy follows. \nTITLE CARD: WARRIOR \nINT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen. \nTOMMY I like what you've done with the place. \nPADDY (O.S.) Appreciate that. \nThe sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca lounge chair. \n", "test1_true": "PADDY (O.S.) No more women for me, Tommy. \nTOMMY Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays. \nTommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous. \nPADDY Here you go. \nTOMMY Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him? \nPADDY I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days. \nTOMMY C'mon, just one drink. \nPADDY No. \nTommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns back to the photos. He takes them in. \nFRAMED PHOTO OF: 12-YEAR-OLD TOMMY, IN A WRESTLING UNIFORM AND HOLDING A HUGE TROPHY, STANDING NEXT TO A YOUNGER PADDY, WHO WEARS A TOWEL OVER HIS SHOULDER, CIRCA 1992. \nFRAMED PHOTO OF: YOUNG PADDY AND A LOVELY, THIN WOMAN DANCING AWKWARDLY AT A WEDDING RECEPTION, CIRCA 1974. \nFRAMED PHOTO OF: THE SAME WOMAN, SHIELDING HER EYES FROM THE SUN, STANDING NEXT TO TWO YOUNG BOYS, AGED 4 AND 6, AT THE KENNYWOOD AMUSEMENT PARK, CIRCA 1984. \nFRAMED PHOTO OF: 8-YEAR-OLD TOMMY, A YOUNGER PADDY, AND A 10- YEAR-OLD BOY STANDING IN FRONT OF A BLAST FURNACE WEARING HARD HATS CIRCA 1988. \nTommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in the other photos. His brother BRENDAN. \nPADDY (CONT'D) (OFF PICTURE) He's a school teacher down in Philly. \nTommy's face registers surprise. \nPADDY (CONT'D) Remember Tess? They've got two beautiful little girls. \nTommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at the bible, then stares hard at Paddy. \nTOMMY So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew? \nPaddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) So, you gonna ask about her, or you just gonna sit there all sober? \nPADDY I know. \nTOMMY Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too. \nPADDY When I got sober I hired a man to find you. \nTOMMY (taking a swig) Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24? \nPADDY Just the 12. \nTOMMY Did your guy tell you what you needed to know? \nPADDY Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was enough. \nTOMMY That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details. \nTommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. MOBY DICK. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) You could've heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat. Having me rub her down with holy water, because she didn't have no insurance. All the while waiting for your pal Jesus to save her. Did your man tell you that? \nPADDY I'm sorry, Tommy. \nTOMMY It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way. \n", "test1_id": 6, "test2_input": "Tommy marches past Paddy again, then off through the crowd. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan marching through the crowd, and straight into the final four! \nThe arena is on its collective feet CHANTING \"Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!\" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades. \nEXT. BOARDWALK - DAWN \nDawn breaks over Atlantic City. \nINT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME \nA CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens. Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines. \nFrom a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who doesn't acknowledge him. \nPADDY Can't sleep, huh? \nTommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy. \nPADDY (CONT'D) I know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but I'm proud of you. What you did for that kid in the tank? That was really something. \nTOMMY How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown? \nPADDY No. (BEAT) What'd you do? \nTOMMY What'd I do? I took off. \nPaddy starts putting things together. \nPADDY That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records. \nTommy doesn't respond. \nPADDY (CONT'D) What the hell happened over there, Tommy? \nTOMMY That is none of your business. \nPADDY Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand. \nTOMMY Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit. \nPADDY I'm really trying here, Tommy. \nTOMMY You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you. \nPaddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Look at you. Yeah, I was right. I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. At least you had some balls then. Not like now. Tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else, old man. \nTommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with QUARTERS. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) In fact, you know what? Here's a cup. Why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? (MORE) \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. Go on, get outta here. (BEAT) Get the fuck outta here! \nTommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his slot machine as his destroyed father limps away. \nEXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY \nFourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME \nPaddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck, clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. \"Moby Dick\" plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off. LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen off the wagon. Hard. \nPADDY God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards! \n", "test2_true": "PADDY (CONT'D) Ishmael! God pity `em! Stop the ship! Please stop the ship! Somebody help `em! \nSuddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy. \nPADDY (CONT'D) Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch! \nPaddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The monster from the past. \nPADDY (CONT'D) You stop the ship, you Godless sonofabitch! \nThere's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue is heard coming from the earphones. \nPADDY (CONT'D) Captain. Oh captain. Stop the ship. For the love of God. We're lost. \nThe old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING. \nPADDY (CONT'D) Please stop the ship. \nPaddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries the whiskey bottle from his hand \nPADDY (CONT'D) We're lost. We're all lost, Tommy. We'll never make it back. \nTommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew. \nPADDY (CONT'D) (MUMBLING) I always loved you. You know that, don't you Tommy? I always loved you. You and your brother. My two boys. \nTommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into the room. The end of a very long night. \nEXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT \nA bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the entire east coast has descended on AC. \nOutside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course. \nMad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan holding a sling shot. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME \nThe crowd at a fever pitch. Two sections full of MARINES in dress uniforms cheer insanely. So does an entire section of GIRLS wearing camouflage tank tops and holding up signs reading \"TOMMY GIRLS.\" Everyone in the arena chants \"Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!\" A cult hero has been born. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy Riordan, coming down the tunnel without his trainer. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME \nColt's is packed. FIGHTERS. PEOPLE off the street. VETS in fatigues. A bigger crowd than before. \nSHERIDAN (V.O.) Once again, no walk out music. \nCALLEN (V.O.) I wouldn't say no walk out music, Sam. Listen to this. \nON TV SCREEN: TOMMY MARCHING TOWARD THE CAGE AND BEING SERENADED BY THE MARINES. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME \nThe Marines are on their feet, singing \"HALLS OF MONTEZUMA\" at the top of their lungs. \nMARINES (SINGING) From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea... \nAt cageside, Sheridan leans over to Callen, raising his voice to be heard above the Marines. \nSHERIDAN It sounds like VJ Day in Times Square, Bryan. I've never seen anything like it! \nTommy climbs up the stairs and into the cage. He turns and nods at the Marines. \nCALLEN (V.O.) Tommy acknowledging his comrades for the first time, and climbing into the cage. \n", "test2_id": 7, "test3_input": "CALLEN (V.O.) He's doing it again! Conlon's doing it again! This is going to be over! \nBrendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in. \nBRENDAN Tap, Tommy! \nTommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact, he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Tap! \nThe shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the round. \nBrendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence, and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nThe crowd fired up by Brendan's comeback, and mesmerized by what's taking place in the cage between the brothers. It's complete and utter chaos in there. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY PACES IN HIS CORNER, HIS SHOULDER WRECKED. JOSH ROSENTHAL TRIES TO SEE IF HE'S ALRIGHT BUT TOMMY TURNS AWAY. HE'S NOT QUITTING AND NO ONE'S GOING TO TELL HIM HE HAS TO. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME \nSheer amazement that Tommy didn't submit. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nTommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him. \nFrank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water. Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his brother. \nBRENDAN I popped his shoulder. \nFRANK Relax, breathe. \nBRENDAN I heard it tear. \nFRANK You popped his shoulder? Good. I want you to pop his other shoulder. \nThis is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh Rosenthal. \nBRENDAN Josh! \nFrank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face. \nFRANK Hey! Hey! No Josh! Look at me! You got two rounds left! You need both rounds! Go in there, kick him in the head, take him down, and finish him! \nRosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low. Brendan makes eye contact with him. \nBRENDAN Tommy! What are you doing? \nTOMMY Shut up! C'mon. \nBRENDAN What are you that crazy? \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Let's go to war! \nThe BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother. \nBRENDAN What are you doing? It's over! \nFrank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) It's over, Tommy. C'mon. We don't have to do this. \nTommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him. Everything about him says \"Quit, Tommy.\" But Tommy won't. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - SAME \n", "test3_true": "EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nZito and the kids staring at the screen, imploring Brendan to take the helpless Tommy out and win the championship. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - SAME \nBrendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid. He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he doesn't do something. \nFRANK Finish him! You finish him! \nTommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally, with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him, blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it. \nBrendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls Brendan away. \nJOSH ROSENTHAL Break! Break! \nBrendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet. \nFrom near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nThe crowd wants a victory. Tito and the boys start the \"Mis- ter C!\" chant again. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: FRANK ADMONISHES BRENDAN IN HIS CORNER. IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S TELLING HIM, BUT BRENDAN'S EYES ARE FAR AWAY. HE'S NOT LISTENING TO A WORD. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - MOMENTS LATER \nTommy and Brendan stand for Round Five. Tommy's face is battered after Round Four and Brendan's face is ruined. \nIn the crowd, the \"Tommy\" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact, it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down. \nINT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER \nAll eyes riveted to the screen, where the brothers circle each other as in the fourth round. \nON SCREEN: MORE PAINFUL STABBING JABS FROM TOMMY. BRENDAN GIVES HIM ONE LAST, LONG LOOK, BUT TOMMY RESPONDS BY KICKING HIM IN THE LEG. FINALLY, LEFT NO CHOICE, BRENDAN SWOOPS. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nBrendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen. \nAs an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him. \nBRENDAN I'm sorry, Tommy! I'm sorry! \nTommy continues to struggle. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) Tap, Tommy! Tap! \nTears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge. \nBRENDAN (CONT'D) I love you, Tommy! I love you! \nTommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting. \nEXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME \nWhile most of the crowd erupts in celebration and the kids leap into each other's arms, Joe Zito stares at the screen. \nON MOVIE SCREEN: AS PEOPLE ENTER THE RING, BRENDAN AND TOMMY STAY ON THE GROUND, BRENDAN CRADLING HIS BROTHER IN HIS ARMS. \nINT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME \nFrank makes eye contact with the jubilant Tess. Indicates she should meet them in the locker room. Meanwhile, people pour into the cage. Frank pushes them aside, keeping them away from Brendan and Tommy, who remain on the ground, exhausted. Tommy to begins to WEEP. \n", "test3_id": 8}

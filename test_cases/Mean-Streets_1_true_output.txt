A barage of bullets (5 gunshots) hit CHARLIE'S car. CHARLIE is hit in the hand. JOHNNY BOY has been hit in the throat. He stands up and leans over the windshield of the car, spewing blood onto it and into the wind. He is screaming. The black sedan turns onto another street. 
CUT TO: 
TONY'S CONVERTIBLE 
CHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding his wrist. He is on the yellow letters "FIRE LANE." JOHNNY BOY lies against the side of a building--still. CHARLIE goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand. The police arrive with their guns drawn.

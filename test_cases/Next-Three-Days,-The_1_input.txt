LARA John? (no reply) What are we going to do? 
JOHN (finally) We're going to the train station. 
John turns right, heading downtown. 
312   INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY                                          312 
Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up. 
Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS and COLLERO share an awkward look. 
SGT. HARRIS (smitten) Hi. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO (casting her eyes down) Hi. 
She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos. 
DETECTIVE QUINN (to Collero) You're not going to nod off, are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
312   CONTINUED:                                                       312 
Collero gives Quinn a burning look.    Nabulsi enters. 
313   EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DAY                                        313 
John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars. Hundreds of people mill out front. 
JOHN Stay in the car. 
John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and arrested. 
John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors. He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested. He approaches an elderly couple. 
314   EXT. INTERSTATE    -- DAY                                        314 
The SUV heads up the on-ramp. 
315   INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY                    315 
Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police. 
LT. NABULSI I understand....I understand. I didn't tell them to stop EVERY vehicle. Just the ones with a couple and a young child. 
He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it on his desk. 
316   INT./EXT. FREEWAY TOLLBOOTH -- DAY                               316 
John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes. The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap. 
ELDERLY MAN Are you sure twenty dollars is enough? Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that. 
And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat, with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll. 
(CONTINUED) 
316   CONTINUED:                                                           316 
JOHN (re: SUV) This thing is very good on gas. 
A State Trooper waves them toward the booth. 
The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.       They are free. 
The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple with a child. 
317   INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY                        317 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Every one in the state. 
LT. NABULSI Go wider. Send their photos to every train, bus station and airport in a three hundred mile radius. 
DETECTIVE COLLERO (looking at her pad) So, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana? 
LT. NABULSI You know what direction they are going, smart ass? 
DETECTIVE COLLERO Captain, a lot of these places barely have fax machines. 
LT. NABULSI Then start dialing. (as they exit:) Prioritize. Closest airports first. 
Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will give him the answer. 
318   EXT. DOWNTOWN BUFFALO -- AFTERNOON                                   318 
The Brennans drop off the elderly couple. John waves, drops his gun in the trash can, gets back in and drives away. 
319   INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON               319 
Harris and Collero finish recreating a portion of John's wall, complete with wallpaper. 
(CONTINUED) 
319   CONTINUED:                                                        319 
Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM. 
Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps going into Nabulsi's office. Nabulsi sits, spinning the coin, jacket off, shirt untucked. 
SGT. HARRIS You want to see it? 
LT. NABULSI Only if it will tell me where they are.

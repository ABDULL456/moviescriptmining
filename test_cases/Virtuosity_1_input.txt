THIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994 
Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle. 
The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997. 
Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the horizon. Making the sky look peculiar. 
The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop, watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER. 
NEWSCASTER (V. 0.) As L. A. P. D. officers gather evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves  what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes? (a beat) The three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic, intelligent, and dangerous... 
The guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or he's got more important things on his mind. 
Everybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians. 
Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department. The guy in the lead is 
PARKER BARNES His body is a running back's. His endurance a marathoner's. His face one you'd want for your own. He's in his 30s. If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous. 
His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself. He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way. 
Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless: 
JOHN I can't get over how different you look. 
PARKER (ruefully) Five years can be a bitch, huh? 
They split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors, repeats his greeting to no one in particular. 
MAITRE D' Good afternoon. May I help you? 
Parker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the hunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you would call Standard Police Procedure. 
Bullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his table. 
John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire. 
JOHN (to the Woman) Lady, move! 
Before she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker. CRASH! They tumble to the floor. 
In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire. John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him. 
Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp. 
Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath. Another kick drops Parker to his knees. 
SID 6.7 (to Parker) I'm going to rehearse with your friend a while, then I'll be back to perform a new piece with you. 
He grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, knocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder. 
SID 6.7 (CONT'D) If you get hungry, I'd recommend the escargot. They're delicious. 
He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7. 
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN 
Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic. 
Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front of his own as a shield. 
PARKER (to Sid 6.7) Where's John? 
SID 6.7 Performing solo. (a beat) Enjoying the concert so far? 
Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with his good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown. 
PARKER Recital's over, asshole. 
He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy hitting Sid 6.7. 
The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid 6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead. 
Sid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly. His gun lies on the floor.

The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders. ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant Christmas tree. 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS 
CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES. They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as the bats attack.  WOMEN SCREAM.  CHILDREN SCREAM.  MEN SCREAM TOO. 
A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a prerecorded voice: "HO HO HO."  The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as the BATS converge on him. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT 
HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour in through the broken window.  WOMEN lined up for a FREE MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their hairdos. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN 
He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below.  He glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at the chaos, TAUNTING him. 
EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT 
A few blocks away from Gotham Square.  SIRENS HOWL.  There's a steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the disturbance.  One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction, against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN. 
EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER 
BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the CORPSES strewn across the helipad.  A dying GUARD raises a shaky hand... 
BATMAN crouches beside him.  A GURGLE comes up from his throat and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips.  All at once he hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE SCULPTURE... 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead.  Finish 'em off... 
His head jerks up.  He can't see anything.  A sudden WHOOSHING noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof. 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) You might as well.  You're going to get blamed for it anyway. 
He stands.  He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof, clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures.  He reaches for a Batarang. 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) Oh, come on, angel.  You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it! 
BATMAN Who are you? 
He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind, feet first, knocking him to the rooftop.  He tries to get up, but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS, knocking him back into a cornice.  He ducks right just as a SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat. 
He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and lands on her feet.  Cats always do... 
CATWOMAN My, aren't we frisky tonight. 
He flings the BATARANG.  It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.  GLASS TUBING shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows -- 
CATWOMAN I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one... 
He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly toward the HELICOPTER.  The huge ROTOR BLADES are still turning... 
BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free -- FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.  It's a strategic move: when he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and KICKS UPWARD with startling force. 
This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER. He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on him. 
She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around his CROTCH.  He tries to break her grip, but she's just as strong as he is.  And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward, toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the helicopter! 
The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises perilously closer.  At the last possible instant, he grabs a handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can -- 
With a YOWL, she releases him.  They tumble to the roof and she DIVES ATOP HIM.  Her TALONS click into place -- he sees them poised directly above his EYES -- 
-- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can strike.  Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and circle each other... 
SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the roof, trying to break it down.  BATMAN turns for an instant -- a sudden CRACK -- 
-- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT- O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.  She sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap.  The BANGING on the door is louder... 
CATWOMAN Did I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat. 
She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching face.  Then she scurries to the edge of the roof, DISAPPEARING -- 
-- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes crashing out onto the roof! 
Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but the COPS are swarming the place.  They spot the BODIES on the tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the obvious conclusion.  Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.  BULLETS RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE. 
BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.  The SWAT COPS score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum, but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to reach the roof. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door. Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all the ruckus -- 
-- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining fast.  Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS A TRIGGER. 
ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT 
A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR. 
INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT 
The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS.  A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS bounce off in rapid succession.  CRACKS begin to spread across the glass. 
The COPS can't see where they're driving.  The car SWERVES WILDLY.  And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...

DR. EVIL Hello Scott, I'm back. 
SCOTT I can't believe you'd do this to me on national television! 
DR. EVIL They offered me a free makeover. 
JERRY SPRINGER Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the fathers here today open up to their sons, sons to the fathers. Is there anything you'd like to share? 
DR. EVIL Share? 
JERRY SPRINGER Yes, don't you have any secrets? 
DR. EVIL OK. I have a vestigial tail. 
Everyone is a little grossed out. 
DR. EVIL It's more of a nub, really. The spine just goes on a little longer than it should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual. I remember once I was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where the story gets interesting. He was lactose-intolerant. He could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. And I remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no teeth." One of my greatest disappointments is that I never became a song and dance man. I could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, singer, actor, and I would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. I once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. For the most part I distrust dogs. I slept in a horse once. It was quite roomy. On second thought, it was the Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy of The Fonze while I was in coma after smoking some Peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done that? 
The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once quiet. 
KLANSMAN What are you, some kind of freak? 
SCOTT Shut up, jagoff! 
Studio audience whoops at this. 
KLANSMAN I'll kick your ass punk! 
Crowd goes crazy. 
DR. EVIL No one talks to my boy that way! 
Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him. Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them. 
DR. EVIL I'm OK, I'm OK. 
There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking him down. 
DR. EVIL Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new evil lair. 
EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and the words: Starbucks World Headquarters. 
INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM 
The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is a Starbucks. 
Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot coffee products. 
NUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman of your organization, I seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small Seattle-based coffee company several years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far- flung empire with 2000 outlets worldwide. 
DR. EVIL Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a good cuppa joe. 
NUMBER TWO If I may continue, I believe if we shift our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium quality coffee drinks, we can increase our gross profits fivefold. 
Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip. 
DR. EVIL Right. Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit.  Might I remind you that I run the show here? I demand a little respect. 
NUMBER TWO (indicating Dr. Evil's milk mustache) Dr. Evil, I think you-- 
DR. EVIL Silence! I will not tolerate your insolence! Remember what happened last time. 
FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE) 
Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways and corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep pause for thought. 
INT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME 
as the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody else's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, working up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip on them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE IS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he hurries off. 
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
as McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY FLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast. 
MCCULLOCH Can you shut that damn thing off?? 
Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN We already thought of that -- nobody could possibly see it in this storm... 
MCCULIACH There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN What about the fire?? 
MCCULLOCH I doubt very much that one even exists. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN What are you talking about? 
MCCULLOCH Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. (resolved) Enough is enough. 
He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van Deusen. 
SEAN We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real. 
Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward. 
EXT. DECK - ON DOOR 
as it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a different deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along the side of the ship, skeet rifle raised. 
JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW 
walking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and precipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, AN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE. 
JULIUS 
shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly lowers the rifle. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out of each other. 
MILES I'll take the upper deck. 
Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent... 
INT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX) 
Filled with black smoke. The fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: DANGER - FUEL TANKS. 
EXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT 
--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. Miles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level. 
POINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER 
Someone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every step. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS AROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S HEAD... 
...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact, flinging it away. 
EXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS 
He's pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE MAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, jerking his head upward. 
JULIUS Miles?? 
His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same time: 
RUNNING WITH MILES 
He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him. 
JASON'S POINT OF VIEW 
He's having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager. 
EXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME 
as Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade. 
EXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT

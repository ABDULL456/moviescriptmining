Lynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in the middle of the desert. 
51 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 51 
LYNN Mayday. . .We're stranded in the desert, we need help...mayday... Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone may have heard them. A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio. The light turns off. The two women look at each other in confusion. 
LYNN (CONT'D) What was that? 
ETHEL It sounded like an animal... Lynn stands up worried. 
LYNN If animals start answering our radio calls, we're really fucked! 
ETHEL Watch your language! 
LYNN Give it a rest, Mom. We have more important things to worry about. She walks out. 
ETHEL Lynn, wait. Ethel stays alone with the baby. 
52 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 52 
Still tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his chain. Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from the wind and moves closer to the fire. 
LYNN Brenda? No answer. 
LYNN (CONT'D) 
(LOUDER) 
BRENDA?! In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother. 
BRENDA 
BOBBY? BOBBY? With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night. 
BRENDA (CONT'D) 
BOBBY? BOB-BY? She hears her older sister calling. 
LYNN (O.S.) Brenda? Brenda? 
BRENDA I'm here! I'll be back in a minute. The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears into the night. 
BRENDA (CONT'D) 
BOBBY? BOB-BY? 
53 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 53 
We fly over the hills before stopping over Bobby's unconscious body laid out between two rocks. Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently. She hears Brenda's calls and runs away. 
(CONTINUED) 
53 CONTINUED: 53 Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has he been unconscious? 
CUT TO: 
54 EXT. TRAILER - MIGHT 54 
The sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the Carters' trailer home. Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from his chest.

BETH (DETERMINED) I got her home number from Patrick. 
DEREK She won't be there. 
BETH She can still pick up her messages. 
DEREK Beth, why are you doing this? 
ETH I want her to know who she's dealing with now. 
On the other end, Lisa's cheerful voice: 
LISA'S VOICE Hi, this is Lisa. I'm not here right now so please leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. Have a good one. 
BETH (into the phone) L isten to me, you little bitch. This is Beth Charles and I just want you to know that if you ever... ever... come near my child or my house again... I'll kill you. 
Beth clicks off, gives Derek a defiant look.       Derek doesn't know what to say. 
The Security Man appears. 
SECURITY MAN You're all set, folks. You want me to show you how the system works? 
BETH Definitely. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT 
Derek lies in bed, wide awake, on guard. He hears a car engine outside, gets up and goes to the window. 
Derek looks out and sees a police patrol car in front of the house. A moment later, it drives off.

CONTINUED: 
Derek goes to Kyle's room. He's sleeping safely. He goes to the master bedroom and observes Beth from the door way. She's asleep. 
Derek returns to the guest room. 
A sudden SOUND.     Derek tenses.   He hops up and goes to the window. 
It's just the sprinklers going on in the front yard. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLES LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING 
Derek is leaving for work.     He points to the security pad. 
DEREK Make sure you set this. 
BETH You don't have to tell me. 
DEREK It can't go on much longer. They're bound to pick her up soon. THEN) Look, if you want me to stay, I'll call in... 
BETH No. Go to work. If anything happens, the security patrol can be here in two minutes. (off his look) Go. I can take care of myself. 
Derek opens the door and exits.      Beth closes it behind him, then touches the keypad. 
SECURITY VOICE SET. 
Beth watches from the window as Derek drives off to work. Kyle is nearby playing. The phone rings. Beth goes over and picks it up, a little wary. 
BETH Hello? Oh hi, Dad. (THEN) What's wrong? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
As she listens with mounting concern, we... 
CUT TO:

Patrick is at his desk.    The phone buzzes and he picks up. 
PATRICK Derek Charles' office.      Oh, hi, Beth. 
Patrick perks up at the tone in Beth's voice.

INT. DOCKING PORT 
Lev, Sharp, and Chick are walking toward the shuttles. The ELECTRICITY in the  MIR FLUTTERS. Lev stops. Sharp stops. Lev looks over his shoulder toward the  central hub. A chill runs down his spine. DOLLY INTO LEV'S EYES - 
Lev (whispering) Leak. Run. 
Lev and Sharp run toward the central hub. Lev punches a KLAXON. 
Lev (cont'd) LEAK! RUN!

INT. MIR STATION - REAR MODULE 
The smoking circuitry SPARKS, and the REAR MODULE explodes in a VIOLENT  CONCUSSION, LAUNCHING A LONG TONGUE OF FLAME into -- INT. MIR STATION - UPPER  MODULES

Everything is SIDEWAYS. Lev is KNOCKED to the ground. A HEAVY COMPUTER BOARD  falls, separating A.J. and Lev. 
Attempting to reach A.J., Lev turns back and runs from where he just came. 
INT. MIR STATION - UPPER MODULES - SEALED CORRIDOR 
A.J. looks left, then right. He doesn't know how to get to the docking port. He  starts running. 
INT. MIR STATION - DOCKING PORTS 
Sharp re-joins Bennie and Truman. They unhook the FUEL LINES to the shuttles.  Sharp and Chick run aboard Shuttle Freedom. Truman boards Independence. 
INT. MIR CORRIDOR 
A.J. is at the corridor fork. Right or left? The Russian writing above both  paths doesn't help. Just as he's about to go left -- Lev suddenly appears, grabs  A.J., and PUSHES HIM into the RIGHT CORRIDOR. 
Lev Run Yankee!

TIDWELL See, man, that's the difference. between us.  You think we're fighting, I think we're finally talking! 
INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY 
Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with thought. 
INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY 
Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his calls. 
DOROTHY Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy. 
JERRY (jolted into happiness) Happy. He said "happy?" 
DOROTHY Actually he said "glad." 
JERRY Good.  Good.  Glad is good. 
DOROTHY Plus, you could use that commission. 
She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done. 
JERRY I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and -- 
DOROTHY You don't have to explain. 
JERRY Look, the other night, I want to apologize. 
DOROTHY (can't read her) Yeah, what happened there. 
JERRY We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere. 
DOROTHY I'm relieved you said that. 
JERRY I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- (beat) -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again. 
DOROTHY (evenly) Oh good. 
JERRY You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. 
DOROTHY Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. (more) 
DOROTHY (cont'd) Think about everything that's gone wrong, how to fix them, and just be... alone, alone, alone. 
Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction. 
JERRY You want to go out to dinner? 
INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY 
Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine. 
JAN I broke up with the Cowboy. And now he's stalking me... 
ALICE What's the current definition of stalking? 
WOMAN # 1 Coming over uninvited. 
JAN (thoughtful) So Romeo under the trellis... was a stalker. 
Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket. 
INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag, which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging Jerry. 
INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid. Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy. 
DOROTHY Hey, looks like you've got a fan. 
JERRY (outdressed) Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie. 
DOROTHY Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. (then) You meet Chad the nanny? 
JERRY Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were... 
He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new sensation for this bachelor. 
DOROTHY Don't let him stay up too late. 
CHAD (grandly) Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz. 
DOROTHY Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense. 
She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse. 
CHAD You know, you people have a jazz problem in this house.

INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - EVENING 
Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the stovepipe hat and gloves on the table. 
John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops these on the floor. As they watch Hay: 
LINCOLN I did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, I qualified it. 
JAMES ASHLEY Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to know why you qualified it - 
SCHUYLER COLFAX No one heard the intelligent or the educated part. All they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of Negro voting. 
LINCOLN Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a better speech. 
JAMES ASHLEY Mr. Stevens also wants to know why you didn't make a better speech. 
They laugh. There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters. 
JOHN NICOLAY (TO LINCOLN:) Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the carriage. She wants me to remind you of the hour, and that you'll have to pick up Miss Harris and Major Rathbone. 
Lincoln nods. Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and gloves. Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly. 
LINCOLN Am I in trouble? 
WILLIAM SLADE No, sir. 
LINCOLN Thank you, Mr. Slade. 
Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain their drinks and rise. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) I suppose it's time to go, though I would rather stay. 
He leaves the room. 
INT. AN EMPTY CORRIDOR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table. Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again. Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down the empty hallway. 
Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone. 
INT. A THEATER - NIGHT 
The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting. 
Onstage, a Caliph's palace. A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed, then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a 
flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's heart. 
The audience applauds. In the center box, Tad Lincoln is joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel. 
Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies, the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken. 
In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on the stage, eyes open, alarmed. 
The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands. 
LEONARD GROVER (VOICE SHAKING:) The President has been shot. 
There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap from their seats. 
LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D) The President has been shot at Ford's Theater! 
The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium. People cry, jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats, shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible in the uproar. 
Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose. Tad can't stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing. 
INT. THE BEDROOM IN PETERSON'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING 
Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. A small, hissing gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light. 
Stanton, Speed, GENERAL HENRY HALLECK and a MINISTER, are standing. Welles sits by the head of the bed. DR. CHARLES LEALE, a young army surgeon, and DR. ROBERT STONE, the Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the bed, while DR. JOSEPH BARNES, the Surgeon General, listens to Lincoln's faint breathing. 
Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing.

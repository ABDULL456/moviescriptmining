STEVE (O.S.) Fuck that, take your fucking camera. 
The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge; the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket. 
ANDREW (O.S.) You don't have to- I mean I can- 
Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the car. It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain. 
MATT Andrew, just stop, just stop doing things. 
Steve dives off the side of the bridge.   Andrew films him for a moment, swimming to the car. 
INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very quickly. 
ANDREW (O.S.) Are you mad? 
MATT Stop, just stop. 
EXT. RIVER SIDE ROAD 
Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK ASSHOLE out of the water. They hurry out of the car. 
CUT. 
Steve has the guy on the shore.    He's dazed and bleeding. 
REDNECK ASSHOLE -what happened, cause...I don't know....my truck, my truck... 
ANDREW (O.S.) Is he okay? 
Steve just stares directly at Andrew.   Andrew pans to reveal Matt, on a cell phone. 
MATT Yes, just past White Crescent bridge. Down by the- yes- 
ANDREW (O.S.) Is that the cops, are you calling the cops? 
MATT (ignoring him) Yeah, just come- no, I don't know. I don't know, maybe internal bleeding, or- 
CUT. 
Later. The cops and an ambulance have arrived. An officer is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low. 
LOCAL OFFICER -looks like he'll be okay. Lucky you guys were here. Is that on? You can go ahead and turn that off. The camera shuts off. 
EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and freaked out. Matt's car is parked nearby. 
ANDREW (O.S.) I don't see how you guys can be so angry- 
MATT You don't see how we can be angry? You put a man in the hospital for fucksakes. You put a man in the hospital, you hurt somebody- 
ANDREW (O.S.) He was being an asshole- he- I didn't mean to- 
MATT Which part of that do you mean, do you mean he was being an asshole, or was it an accident? Was it an accident, Andrew, cause you're the strongest. Listen, with this, we can't fuck around, ever. 
ANDREW (O.S.) Then what've we been doing, we've been fucking around- 
MATT NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you can't use it on people, or hurt people like- Steve, help me out.

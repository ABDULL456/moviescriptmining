I'm fucking gone! \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN He stole another contract. \nRath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect himself. \nRATH I'm being set up.  Fucking set up! \nHe looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the pattern completely familiar. \nRATH Is this how it went, Nick? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Robert?  Robert? \nRath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types. \nRATH/SCREEN How did he know? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Know what? \nRATH/SCREEN The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know. \nA long beat. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Such language in front of a lady. \nRath still talking and typing. \nRATH/SCREEN I don't know what the fuck you are. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN I know.  It was a joke. \nRath stands, no longer typing. \nRATH A joke?  A joke? \nRath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the screen. \nRATH You think this is a fucking joke? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN \nRath looks at the number. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN That's the bonus on the contract. \nRath puts the gun down. \nRATH/SCREEN Deadline? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Tomorrow.

SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY \nThere is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches down, heat rising off the tarmac. \nINT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY \nSeveral passengers walk through the gate into the terminal. \nAcross from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport cafeteria, reading a folded paper. \nHe is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered to his side. \nTaped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph of a Japanese man wanted for \"industrial espionage.\" \nAt the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously muscle. \nRath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall. When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper and begins to follow. \nHis pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to find Bain's. \nHis hand hovers near his gun. \nAhead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face. \nThe man starts toward a drinking fountain. \nRath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but he isn't sure. \nThe young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22. \nA mouthful of water coughs from his mouth. \nIt is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone. \n", "test1_true": "Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY \nThe five men stride through the automated terminal doors and towards a waiting limousine. \nFurther down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, exits and hails a cab. \nINT. CAB \nRATH Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them? \nCABBY Sure. \nRath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as the cab pulls away. \nINT. LIMOUSINE \nThe five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to RING. \nThe older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase, removing a cellular phone. \nAKIRA Hello? \nWe hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses English. \nELECTRA (V.O.) I trust your flight was comfortable? \nAKIRA Your Japanese is excellent. \nELECTRA (V.O.) Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nElectra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone. \nELECTRA I'll call you again in twenty minutes. \nShe punches a button and shoves the antennae down. \nThe hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct. \nThe panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct. \nImmediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations. She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on- line. \nOn the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in. \nINT. CAB \nRath stares out the window, watching the surrounding traffic, the limo still in sight. \nSomething occurs to him and he looks down at the folded newspaper where he had hid the contract file. \nHe flips past several documents before finding what he's looking for; the cat. \nHe pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nLaying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches Electra rush about. \nElectra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks it out. \nELECTRA Excuse me, your Highness. \nNikita casually walks off the bed. \nElectra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct-tape. \nEXT. HYATT HOTEL \nThe limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway. \nThe cab pulls in behind it. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone. \nINT. HYATT LOBBY \nThe Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and uncomfortable. \nThe BRIEFCASE RINGS. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra is pacing again. \nELECTRA Room 1414. \nINT. HYATT LOBBY \nWith several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an elevator.  The doors close. \nAcross the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nAs the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a familiar sound. \n", "test1_id": 2142, "test2_input": "She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want to be left alone right now. \nShe reaches over and moves a white knight. \nHe blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities. \nHe picks a bishop and counters. \nAfter another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight. \nRATH Why did you trade a bishop for a knight? \nELECTRA I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights. \nRATH They're worth less points. \nELECTRA So? \nThere is no point in arguing. \nAs they continue to play, we begin to hear in the distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very vigorous LOVE. \nElectra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no sign of it, concentrating on the game. \nELECTRA Do you hear them? \nHe looks up. \nELECTRA Listen. \nHe hears it.  Not interested. \nELECTRA Did you think they were newlyweds? \nRATH I didn't notice them. \nELECTRA When I first saw them I thought they were married. \nRATH How do you know they're not? \nELECTRA I went into their room this afternoon. \nRATH What? \nELECTRA It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in. \nRATH Jesus, if someone had -- \nELECTRA Nobody ever sees me. \nRATH Why in the hell would you take that chance? \nELECTRA I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did. \nRath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST SCREAMING. \nELECTRA She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex. \nRATH Thank you. \nELECTRA Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy? \nRATH No. \nELECTRA No? \nRATH It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels. \nELECTRA I know.  It makes me crazy. \nRATH Why? \nELECTRA I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor. \nRATH And you were drilling these holes...? \nELECTRA So I could watch the girl that lived under me. \nRATH Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you. \nELECTRA He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation. \nRATH Did he explain how this happened? \nELECTRA He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole. \nThe WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX. \nElectra moves her queen, taking his other knight. \nRATH What are you doing? \nELECTRA What? \nRATH That's a ridiculous move. \nELECTRA Why? \nRATH Because, I'll take it. \nELECTRA I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way. \n", "test2_true": "ELECTRA Can I ask you something? \nRATH I'm sure you will. \nELECTRA Am I attractive? \nThis gets his attention. \nRATH Yes. \nELECTRA Are you attracted to me? \nRATH Yes. \nELECTRA Why? \nRATH Why?  I don't know. \nELECTRA Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing? \nRATH Both. \nA good answer.  Electra smiles. \nELECTRA Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before? \nRATH I didn't want to complicate the situation. \nELECTRA Attraction is a complication? \nRATH It can be. \nELECTRA It happened to you before? \nRATH Yes. \nELECTRA Who was she? \nRATH Someone like me, like you.  A pro. \nELECTRA What happened to her? \nRATH She was taken. \nELECTRA Did you -- \nRATH No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't. \nELECTRA Was she the only one? \nRATH After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. \nELECTRA Is this becoming complicated? \nRATH I'm not sure that I care anymore. \nHe looks up from the game. \nELECTRA Were you attracted to me right away? \nRATH No. \nELECTRA When did it start? \nRATH Honestly? \nELECTRA Uh-huh. \nRATH When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me. \nELECTRA Maybe you should see a psychiatrist. \nRATH Why? \nELECTRA That doesn't sound normal. \nRATH I'm not normal. \nELECTRA I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you. \nThey rise up from the table, together, knocking over the chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor. \nThey grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry, aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as they become naked in front of each other.  There is nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very real. \nHe takes her, lifting her onto the table. \nShe scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out of the way. \nShe opens her legs and he moves in between them. \nELECTRA I wanted to tell you -- \nHer breath rushes out, then back in. \nELECTRA My real name is Anna. \nHe smiles. \nRATH Martin. \nELECTRA Martin. \n", "test2_id": 2143, "test3_input": "He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS. \nShe watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him. \nThe gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but he is gone. \nEXT. PLAZA \nRath races wildly across the darkening market square. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nBain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS. \nBAIN Die, bitch! \nHe FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the floor around her feet. \nScreaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall. \nHis shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as -- \nShe sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall. \nBeneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until -- \nElectra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed. \nShe flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is PERFORATED with BULLETS. \nBAIN Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you doing?  I don't believe this is happening! \nShe can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go. \nBAIN You're dead!  You're fucking dead! I'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this! \nBain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves he'll know her position. \nHe FIRES another. \nElectra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. \nAnother SHOT. \nShe FIRES back. \nBain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS, flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets. \nHer gun empties first. \nHe laughs hearing the CLICK. \nBAIN Game over, bitch! \nRATH Bain! \nRath's scream ECHOES up through the building. \nBefore Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream- like grid resembling a chess board. \nElectra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. \nThe two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she races back to the room. \nBAIN Fuck no! \nRath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty. \nRATH Shit! \nBain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to the end of the hall. \nRath sees it all happening. \nRATH Electra! \nBain snaps into a targeting stance. \nElectra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly touching the floor -- \nTELESCOPIC SIGHT \nWhen the cross-hairs find her back. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRATH Electra! \nTime becomes syrup. \nRATH Down!  Get down! \nBain FIRES. \nElectra dives. \nThe blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her. \nShe bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room. \nBain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the stairs. \n", "test3_true": "Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22. \nBain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door. \nInside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open. \nA GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard. \nRath and Bain both see it. \nStaying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it. \nBain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door.  Something's got to give. \nUnsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door. \nBain makes his choice, moving towards room 502. \nRath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows -- \nBolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip, the ground a blur beneath him -- \nBain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath. \nTwo more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as -- \nThe RIFLE SPITS -- \nRath screams, his leg erupting with blood. \nTELESCOPIC SIGHT \nThe scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRath rams the clip in place. \nBAIN Game -- \nBain squeezes the trigger -- \nCLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief. \nRolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but Bain is gone. \nElectra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole that Bain fell through. \nGrimacing, Rath struggles to his feet. \nRATH Electra! \nBain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying. \nElectra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN, swallowing her. \nLimping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH. \nJarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the open ceiling. \nRATH The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid of it!  Throw it! \nShe looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands. \nHis leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall. \nBlack with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to the fourth level through another burned opening. \nElectra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. \nLumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. \nHearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls. \nRath hears her scream. \nElectra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. \nShe gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. \nBain grabs the gun. \nRath whips into the room BLASTING -- \nBULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. \nRath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. \nFrom within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH. \nBAIN (O.S.) Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy. \nElectra comes to, her eyes blinking open. \nBAIN (O.S.) Are you still thinking that you're going to take me? \nElectra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice, searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from everywhere. \nBAIN (O.S.) No, I don't think you are.  You know what I think? \nThe voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from his eyes. \n", "test3_id": 2144}

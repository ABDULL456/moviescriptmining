{"train": "Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight. \nESCORT (WOMAN) Hi.  Did you call -- \nRATH Yes.  Please come in. \nHer HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat. \nESCORT Goodness, it's so dark... \nShe reaches for the wall switch but he stops her. \nRATH I prefer it like this. \nESCORT How can a beautiful man like you be shy? \nHe smiles. \nRATH I prefer it, that's all. \nShe moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat. \nESCORT It's okay, honey.  We can do it anyway you want. \nRath is obviously uncomfortable. \nRATH Would you like a drink? \nESCORT I'd love one.  Whatever you're having. \nThey move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows. \nShe stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a city night. \nESCORT Beautiful. \nHe hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect. \nESCORT Good will towards men. \nTheir glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she drinks at all, we can not tell. \nRATH Why are you working today? \nESCORT Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't. \nShe touches his face, the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine. \nRATH You're very good at this aren't you? \nESCORT I think you're supposed to answer that question. \nHer hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar. \nRATH I know what you expect, but I don't want... \nHe pours himself another drink. \nESCORT That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected. \nRATH I called because I just want... I need to talk. \nShe sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener. \nRATH I've been thinking about my life, about things I have done... What I do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do. \nHe sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol. \nRATH I know that everything has a price.  I want you to understand that I'm willing to pay. \nHe takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills. \nESCORT For what? \nRATH Honesty. \nShe puts the envelope down. \nRATH I just want to ask you some questions. \nUncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for the right words. \nRATH Do you ever regret things you've done? \nESCORT Everyone regrets something. \nRATH But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them? \nESCORT Sometimes. \nRATH Do you think about their wives or their families? \nESCORT No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist. \nRath nods.  His next question is barely audible. \nRATH Do you ever think about starting over? \nESCORT All the time. \nRATH Can you tell me about it? \nSpread out over the table are several faxed photos of the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by bodyguards. \nThe file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his income tax return. \nSatisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the modem and makes a call. \nThe network comes on-line as the General Contractor types: \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN You're too late, Robert. \nRath types. \nRATH/SCREEN What? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN The contract was stolen. \nRath stares at the screen. \nRATH/SCREEN Who? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai. \nThe name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN You know what must be done. \nThe screen goes black as the network shuts down. \nRath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been circled in red pen by Rath:  \"Trattoria Roma.\" \nEXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT \nA red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian restaurant. \nINT. TRATTORIA ROMA \nIt is a large establishment with many tables and booths. The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian families who have been eating here for years. \nRath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian. \nIn front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine. He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies the room. \nLEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian. \nThe entourage moves through the restaurant to the over- sized booth in the back. \nRath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin. \nLeevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the room. \nA wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles. They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back to the kitchen. \nAt Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses. \nIt is the goon standing against the wall that is the first to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is BAIN.  He smiles. \nThe goon reaches for his gun as -- \nBain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He screams. \nLeevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm. \nIt happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead. \nLeevio screams. \nLEEVIO Don't! \nA FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT. \nLeevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table. \nBain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON from his belt expecting an attack. \nFacing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who moves or stands, men or women. \nThere is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling to the ground, scrambling under tables. \nBain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other. \nThe restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing. \nHe moves through the room, watching, searching. \nBAIN Don't anybody move.  You move, you're dead. \nHe passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty. \nBAIN Come on, you chicken shit motherfucker.  I know you're here. Let's go. \nEXT. CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE \nAcross the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together a German assault rifle with night scope. \nINT. TRATTORIA ROMA \nBain looks out the window at the dark street. \nHe turns and searches through the people huddled on the floor.  He aims his gun. \nBAIN You!  Get up! \nCOP Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread your legs! \nBain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him, frisking him.  In this position the Cop is unable to find the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the Gameboy. \nBAIN Hey, don't touch that! \nCOP Shut up! \nThe Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing him tightly. \nThey drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and paramedics in the street. \nINT. PARKING GARAGE \nRath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the police car, but is unable to get a clean shot.  Bain is using the cops for cover, keeping his head low. \nRATH Son of a bitch. \nThe Cops shove Bain into the back seat. \nRath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into the trunk.  He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE. \nINT. PATROL CAR \nThe two Officers are outside the car talking with the sergeant. \nBain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the shadowy parking garage.  He smiles. \nThe two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up the radio.  The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and white RUMBLES down the street. \nCOP #2 This is 181, returning with suspect involved in multiple shooting at Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route with suspect. \nHe hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the metal caging. \nCOP #2 Jesus Christ, do you know who you shot in there? \nBain almost laughs. \nCOP #2 What are you?  Some kind of a hitman? \nBain looks out the window. \nCOP #2 You know what we call guys like you? \nBain looks at him. \nCOP #2 Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your ass. \nHe laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who chuckles. \nEXT. CITY STREET \nRath's car races down the street trying to catch up with the patrol car. \nINT. PATROL CAR \nBain stares out the window, silent. \nBehind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his right hand. \nThe Cop is playing with the Gameboy. \nWith a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket. His expression remains perfectly blank. \nThe thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  The skin stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his wrist. \nThe Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  A font of blood arcs onto the windshield. \nGrabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the blade into the back of his neck. \nThe driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip. \nHe slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the CAR SKIDS out of control. \nBain stabs the Cop again, his GUN FIRING WILDLY as -- \nThe patrol car starts to flip and roll. \nINT. RATH'S CAR \nRath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION, several blocks away. The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right. \nEXT. STREET \nOrange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned patrol car.  Oil black clouds billow into the night sky. \nRath's car cruises past. \nRath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out. \nBain is gone. \nRATH I'm not done yet. \nEXT. CITY STREET INTERSECTION \nA brand new cab is sitting at a red light. \nThe cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of headlights roll up behind him.  The car gets closer, the lights brighter; they don't stop. \nHe shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS BUMPER. \nRATH Okay. \nBAIN What?  What's okay? \nRath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange. \nBAIN What are you doing? \nRATH There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good. \nBain laughs. \nBAIN Oh man, that's sweet.  That's fucking sweet. \nThe speedometer continues to climb. \nBAIN You're bluffing. \nRath says nothing.  Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals, is the sand barricade. \nBAIN You're fucking with me.  You want me to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes and bang -- Game over. \nThe cab is flying at its target. \nBAIN No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over! \nRATH I know you're going to jump. \nBain looks at him and then at the barricade. \nRATH You're still young.  Young enough to still think you're indestructible. Invincible.  You believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive. \nThe barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the windshield. \nRATH If you do survive, we'll see each other again. \nBain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself out. \nRath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of sand as -- \nBain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped across water. \nA driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him. \nSAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag balloons out of the steering wheel. \nBain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill. \nThe cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM. \nSeveral cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car stopping inches from him.  A woman jumps out, rushing to the front of the car, but Bain is gone. \nPolice CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident.  One of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  The door is open, the airbag popped.  Rath is gone. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nA large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco. \nINT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the windows. \nThe dining and living rooms look like the control booth of a network television show, stacks of video monitors and consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang everywhere like some technological jungle. \nAt the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a bowl of popcorn in her lap. \nOn the monitors, she is watching what at first might be mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an argument. \nWhat is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish- eye lens staring down into the room. \nMAN (V.O.) I don't give a shit what your mother thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your mother, I'm sleeping with you. \nWOMAN (V.O.) You won't be for long, with that attitude. \nMAN (V.O.) Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god damned worried about your mother's approval, why don't you move back home so she can pat you on the head when you do something right. \nELECTRA Jerk. \nJennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very real. \nShe starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep herself from crying. \nMAN (V.O.) Oh good.  Go ahead and cry. \nJENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.) Would you please leave? \nElectra lifts her head, smelling the air. \nELECTRA Mmm, smell that, Nikita? \nNikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every corner of the chair has been clawed open. \nElectra reaches for the control board and throws a series of switches. \nThe monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us, almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking out a tray of chocolate chip cookies. \nElectra smells them again, smiling as she inhales. \nELECTRA I hope she saves some for us. \nThere is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, and a MAN YELLING. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN It cost us. \nRath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen. \nRATH I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone! \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN He stole another contract. \nRath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect himself. \nRATH I'm being set up.  Fucking set up! \nHe looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the pattern completely familiar. \nRATH Is this how it went, Nick? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Robert?  Robert? \nRath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types. \nRATH/SCREEN How did he know? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Know what? \nRATH/SCREEN The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know. \nA long beat. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Such language in front of a lady. \nRath still talking and typing. \nRATH/SCREEN I don't know what the fuck you are. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN I know.  It was a joke. \nRath stands, no longer typing. \nRATH A joke?  A joke? \nRath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the screen. \nRATH You think this is a fucking joke? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN \nRath looks at the number. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN That's the bonus on the contract. \nRath puts the gun down. \nRATH/SCREEN Deadline? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus. \nThe FAX MACHINE COMES TO LIFE, printing an inky image. \nRATH/SCREEN Who is the mark? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist. \nRATH A player? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.' \nRath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for the wide, slit-iris cat eyes. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY \nThere is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches down, heat rising off the tarmac. \nINT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY \nSeveral passengers walk through the gate into the terminal. \nAcross from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport cafeteria, reading a folded paper. \nHe is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered to his side. \nTaped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph of a Japanese man wanted for \"industrial espionage.\" \nAt the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously muscle. \nRath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall. When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper and begins to follow. \nHis pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to find Bain's. \nHis hand hovers near his gun. \nAhead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face. \nThe man starts toward a drinking fountain. \nRath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but he isn't sure. \nThe young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22. \nA mouthful of water coughs from his mouth. \nIt is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone. \nRATH I work for the government. \nELECTRA Yeah? \nShe studies his face, his eyes. \nELECTRA Bullshit. \nRATH Yeah. \nELECTRA You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro. \nRATH I'm part of the game, just like you. \nElectra pounds the steering wheel. \nELECTRA Jesus! \nHe reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag. \nELECTRA What do you think you're doing? \nRath plucks out the bundles of money. \nRATH Twenty large?  That's all? \nELECTRA What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know? \nRATH The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars. \nElectra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  The speedometer is floating around 90. \nRATH Slow down. \nHe pulls out the disks. \nRATH I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more. \nELECTRA Ten million -- \nRATH Now you understand why I'm here. \nElectra wants to scream.  The speedometer is climbing over \nRATH I really think you should slow down. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized suitcases line the wall. \nBain is sitting at the desk.  His WALKMAN is on, MUSIC BLASTING, as he flips casually through the telephone directory. \nHis finger eases down a column stopping at \"Morgan Jennifer.\" \nThere is a KNOCK at the door. \nHe smiles and tears out the page. \nThere is another, LOUDER KNOCK which Bain hears this time. He TURN OFF the WALKMAN and opens the door; a BELLBOY is waiting with a luggage cart. \nBELLBOY Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage you need carried. \nBain gives him a wink and a smile. \nBAIN Indeed I do. \nINT. ELECTRA'S CAR - NIGHT \nThe red \"low fuel\" light is on. \nELECTRA Now what? \nRATH Turn off the engine. \nElectra twists the ignition and the CAR DIES.  Rath glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas station. \nELECTRA You want me to pump? \nRATH No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead. \nElectra says nothing. \nHe reaches over and takes the car keys. \nWhen he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel. \nELECTRA Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think, breathe, think... \nElectra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag. \nOutside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She appears motionless. \nThe electric gas counter races like a stop watch. \nIn the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag. \nThe tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around the car and heads for the station. \nElectra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a tangled handful of wire. \nShe looks up; Rath is inside paying. \nHe inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed. \nStaring at it, he is looking right at Electra. \nBain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers -- \nBAIN (V.O.) Oh, you sick little bitch -- \nElectra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of her. \nShe rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks important.  She grabs Nikita in the \"travel kitty.\" \nEXT. BACK PORCH \nThe door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind her as -- \nBain turns from the back stairs. \nShe leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO HOLES in the door. \nINT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT \nShe scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase, still clutching the \"travel kitty,\" as -- \nThe back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging, FIRING his GUN. \nBULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the front door into the hall. \nINT. HALL \nThe stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway, when -- \nRath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked. \nElectra drops to the floor as -- \nBehind her, Bain barrels from the apartment. \nRath FIRES. \nThe wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain. Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment. \nRath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra. \nThey run down the stairs. \nEXT. REAR STAIRCASE \nBain leaps down the flights. \nEXT. ALLEY \nBain rushes into the street, looking in every direction. They are gone. \nBAIN Fuck me! \nEXT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT \nSomewhere in the city. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra and Rath enter the room together but they are both immediately alone. \nShe walks across the room to a chair in the corner, curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her lap. \nHe sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits. \nThey watch each other.  Silence. \nBetween then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good idea when he sees one. \nRATH Want a drink? \nHer face is as expressionless as Nikita's. \nHe pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down. Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one. \nRATH Okay... \nHe returns to his table with his drink. \nRATH I'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so I'll just go ahead and get started. First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is she thinking?' \nHer body tightens, coils. \nRATH Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an... assassin. \nAnother deep pull on the bourbon. \nRATH Furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape.  Does that leave me any other option? \nHe slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping out his gun. \nRATH No. \nCrossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it to her.  She looks at it.  Back at him. \nHe puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks to the bar. \nShe picks up the gun. \nRATH If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead. \nShe's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that. \nELECTRA I don't need the money. \nRATH This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money. \nELECTRA Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door -- \nRATH If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you. \nELECTRA Why? \nRATH Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you. \nELECTRA You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me. \nRATH No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you. \nELECTRA How? \nRATH Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them. \nShe is coming unglued.  Imagining him watching her tapes, going through her possessions.  She is moving, pacing, ready to explode. \nELECTRA Oh Jesus Jesus... \nRATH He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. \nShe whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD. \nWhen she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him. \nELECTRA Shut up!  All right!  You've said enough! \nShe forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample bottles. \nELECTRA I need to think... To be alone. \nWith the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the door. \nINT. BATHROOM \nShe locks the door and then collapses.  Her body seems to fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the GUN and the BOTTLES falling from her arms, CLATTERING SOFTLY on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands. \nINT. BEDROOM \nVery mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board, putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance. \nFrom the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra CRYING. \nINT. BATHROOM \nWith her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is sobbing, her body rocking.  The crying seems very similar to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release. \nINT. BEDROOM \nRath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but stops himself. \nLike Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to his chess game. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHer eyes are now burning red.  She stops crying long enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch.  Nikita rubs against her and she strokes her. \nELECTRA Oh shit, Nikita. \nINT. BEDROOM \nRath is setting up his computer system.  He hears the TUB FILLING UP. \nINT. BATHROOM \nNikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking. \nELECTRA Cheers. \nElectra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor where we see that many of the bottles are now empty. \nIn the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the water. \nINT. BEDROOM \nWhen Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets the gun on the table between them. \nRath looks up at her. \nELECTRA Listen -- I don't even know your name. \nRATH Rath.  Robert Rath. \nELECTRA Electra. \nRATH Just Electra? \nELECTRA Yeah. \nRATH As in daughter of Agamemnon? \nELECTRA No.  Just Electra. \nELECTRA They didn't give you a choice, did they? \nRATH No, they didn't. \nELECTRA But you knew what they were training you for? \nRATH Of course.  I was going to be James Bond. \nELECTRA Ahhhh... \nRATH They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel -- \nELECTRA The exotic women. \nRATH Women?  No... not really. \nELECTRA Why not? \nRATH Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women. \nELECTRA Why? \nRATH Because you are a women. \nELECTRA Why did you leave the Agency? \nRATH The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you. \nELECTRA They tried to kill you? \nRATH Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared. \nELECTRA Then you went freelance? \nRATH The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets. \nELECTRA Tell me about the first time. \nRATH My first take? \nELECTRA Yes. \nRATH Why? \nELECTRA Because I want to know. \nRATH It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline. \nELECTRA Are they usually like that? \nRATH No.  Just the first one. \nELECTRA After that? \nRATH They become complicated... messy. \nELECTRA Did it ever bother you? \nRATH Did it ever bother James Bond? \nELECTRA That's fiction. \nRATH This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you! \nELECTRA Does that mean it didn't bother you? \nRath leans back and stares at her.  She waits. \nRATH You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time.  You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again. \nElectra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook into her back row. \nRATH Check. \nHe leans back. \nRATH Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless... \nELECTRA No.  Something honest. \nA beat.  Rath likes this woman. \nShe moves her Queen. \nELECTRA Mate. \nHe smiles. \nELECTRA I hope your plan is better than your game. \nINT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and polyester patterned curtains. \nWe hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of naked circuit boards. \nIt is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources. \nBain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of Doritos and his Gameboy. \nOn the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun. \nELECTRA I hope Nikita's all right. \nHe still does not respond. \nELECTRA Hey, where are you? \nRATH Thinking. \nELECTRA About? \nRATH Nothing. \nElectra sips the last of her champagne. \nELECTRA I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say? \nRATH I don't know. \nELECTRA You were there? \nA long beat. \nRATH Yes. \nEXT. SMALL MEXICAN AIRPORT - DAY \nThe plane lands. \nEXT. TERMINAL CAB STAND \nRath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them in his trunk. \nINT. CAB \nRath speaks perfect Spanish. \nRATH (in Spanish) Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca. \nCABBY (in Spanish) Yes, sir. \nEXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY \nThe cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the gulf water. \nRath is upset. \nRATH (in Spanish) No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso. \nCABBY (in Spanish) Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso. \nRATH (in Spanish) No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol. \nCABBY (in Spanish) I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso. \nRATH (in Spanish) Take us there. \nEXT. COSTA BLANCA - DAY \nAmerican tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but much of the out-lying city is very poor. \nThe old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  The face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of the building rather than the building itself. \nRath stares at it, remembering. \nElectra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza del Sol. \nHe looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly opposite of that. \nThe International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful old building; its exterior walls are white-washed concrete, blindingly bright white. \nElectra looks at the bank and smiles. \nELECTRA So, that's where all that S & L money is? \nRath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He turns back to the fourth story window. \nRATH That's where he'll be. \nELECTRA What? \nRATH I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think. \nEXT. HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT \nBeyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to midnight oil. \nINT. HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR \nOn one side of the elevator is a young couple who look like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling as though they are alone. \nElectra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator. It is a strange contrast. \nElectra is staring at them. \nRath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world. \nThe ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens. \nNobody moves. \nThe DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone realizes that this is their floor. \nELECTRA I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep. \nRATH You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me. \nHe pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from the ice bucket. \nELECTRA Thanks. \nShe slips out of the robe and in between the sheets. \nRath sits across the room, his back to her. \nShe tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot. \nELECTRA Do you think he's here? \nRATH Here? \nELECTRA In Costa Blanca. \nRATH Yes. \nShe thinks. \nELECTRA What do you think he's doing? \nRATH I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping. \nShe pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  Her eyes do not close. \nINT. HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT \nA small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built before there was such a thing as central air conditioning. \nBain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder.  His head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in his ears. \nHe is tearing open a long box wrapped in \"Happy Birthday\" paper. \nInside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle. He smiles. \nHe assembles it quickly, snapping it together with automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he jumps up. \nIn the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the gun. \nNot satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes. \nThe butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move. \nBAIN You're dead, motherfucker. \nEXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY \nElectra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea. \nRath stands in the shadow of the door frame. \nRATH Breakfast. \nELECTRA Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here. \nRath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out and sees another hotel with windows facing them. \nHe turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nThe breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee, scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper. \nElectra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach. \nHe stops working. \nELECTRA I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while. \nRATH Okay. \nELECTRA Really? \nRATH He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on. \nELECTRA Book.  Sunglasses.  Great. \nINT. HOTEL HALL \nElectra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach. At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it for her, but she stops herself. \nThe elevator closes. \nShe edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her fingers. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nRath is still at the table. \nThe curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing through the open patio door.  They swell open and fall. It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in the changing shape of the curtain. \nRath stands.  He walks to the open door.  Standing in the frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below. \nHe slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still. \nEXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY \nRATH/SCREEN The contract? \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Paid in full. \nELECTRA Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Transferred to the specified account. \nRath stares at the screen. \nCONTRACTOR/SCREEN Goodbye, Robert. \nRath disconnects.  The PHONE HUMS. \nElectra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle. \nRATH Sit down. \nShe does. \nHe opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens and two small mikes that look like hearing aids. \nRATH Okay -- \nHe starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra picks up the mike.  She looks over it, frowns. \nELECTRA Two way? \nRATH Transmits and receives. \nELECTRA Cheap as shit. \nHe looks at her. \nRATH I paid a lot for these. \nELECTRA They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using -- \nRATH It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these. \nELECTRA Fine. \nHe goes back to his drawing. \nRATH This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank. \nELECTRA Check. \nRATH He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank. \nELECTRA But he won't shoot you right then? \nRATH No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front. \nHe draws another square. \nRATH You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside. \nELECTRA Okay.  Then what? \nRATH Then, we wait. \nELECTRA Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan. \nRATH It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe. \nHe describes this as though remembering it. \nRATH The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank. \nELECTRA Why won't he wait until the bank closes? \nRATH He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun. \nELECTRA What?  What if he brings it with him? \nHe shakes his head. \nRATH He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines. \nELECTRA That means you won't have a gun. \nRATH That's right. \nELECTRA And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank. \nRATH If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me. \nELECTRA You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't -- \nRATH I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car. \nELECTRA We split the money? \nRATH Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine. \nELECTRA Sounds pretty well figured out. \nRATH I've been thinking about it for a long time. \nELECTRA Except -- \nShe watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want to be left alone right now. \nShe reaches over and moves a white knight. \nHe blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities. \nHe picks a bishop and counters. \nAfter another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight. \nRATH Why did you trade a bishop for a knight? \nELECTRA I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights. \nRATH They're worth less points. \nELECTRA So? \nThere is no point in arguing. \nAs they continue to play, we begin to hear in the distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very vigorous LOVE. \nElectra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no sign of it, concentrating on the game. \nELECTRA Do you hear them? \nHe looks up. \nELECTRA Listen. \nHe hears it.  Not interested. \nELECTRA Did you think they were newlyweds? \nRATH I didn't notice them. \nELECTRA When I first saw them I thought they were married. \nRATH How do you know they're not? \nELECTRA I went into their room this afternoon. \nRATH What? \nELECTRA It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in. \nRATH Jesus, if someone had -- \nELECTRA Nobody ever sees me. \nRATH Why in the hell would you take that chance? \nELECTRA I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did. \nRath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST SCREAMING. \nELECTRA She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex. \nRATH Thank you. \nELECTRA Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy? \nRATH No. \nELECTRA No? \nRATH It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels. \nELECTRA I know.  It makes me crazy. \nRATH Why? \nELECTRA I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor. \nRATH And you were drilling these holes...? \nELECTRA So I could watch the girl that lived under me. \nRATH Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you. \nELECTRA He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation. \nRATH Did he explain how this happened? \nELECTRA He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole. \nThe WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX. \nElectra moves her queen, taking his other knight. \nRATH What are you doing? \nELECTRA What? \nRATH That's a ridiculous move. \nELECTRA Why? \nRATH Because, I'll take it. \nELECTRA I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way. \nHer legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into her. \nELECTRA Nice to meet you, Martin. \nINT. HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT \nOutside of the room, we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO PEOPLE MAKING LOVE. \nEXT. COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT \nWe are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot. \nOn the ground are the shattered pieces of the head. \nCLOSER \nWe see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes, which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king. \nCLOSER \nWe MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT \nWe PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares, black and white like a chess board. \nA woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past. \nRISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.  A man crosses behind her, in another direction. \nHIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the black and white marble floor of the -- \nINT. INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY \nIt is a strange and beautiful bank. \nThe ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate, baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble a sun. \nIt looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important Mexican figures. \nAlready it is crowded, people and security guards moving about beneath us. \nRath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers. \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAFE \nThe cafe is off the plaza. \nElectra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can see the back of the burned-out hotel. \nShe hears Rath in her ear-piece. \nRATH (V.O.) All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll move now.  How are you doing? \nShe is nervous. \nELECTRA I'm ready. \nINT. BANK \nRATH Good. \nRath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark sunglasses.  In his hand is a very large briefcase.  He crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows. \nTELLER May I help you? \nRATH Yes.  Could you check on a transfer for me? \nTELLER Your name, or account? \nRATH Rath.  Robert Rath. \nEXT. CAFE \nElectra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name \"Martin.\" \nINT. BANK \nA BANK OFFICIAL walks over to the window, carrying a printed receipt, with a very bright smile. \nOFFICIAL Senor Rath, we have received your transfer. \nHe hands Rath the receipt.  He glances at it, checking the zeros.  There are seven of them. \nRATH Good.  Now I'll need to close this account.  I'd like you to ready the paperwork. \nThe smile fades. \nOFFICIAL You wish to close this account today? \nRATH That's correct. \nOFFICIAL How would you like the funds? \nRATH American currency. \nOFFICIAL This will take some time. \nRATH I have all day. \nOFFICIAL Of course, senor. \nRATH Thank you. \nEXT. CAFE \nElectra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought of all that money. \nELECTRA Ten million dollars, sitting there. Waiting... this is insane. \nINT. BANK \nThere is a faint smile on Rath's lips. \nEXT. PLAZA \nThe shadows are getting longer. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM \nBain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his teeth.  He has to urinate.  Bad. \nHe is checking every face that comes out of the bank with the scope.  Still nothing. \nBAIN This is fucking insane. \nHe grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and begins refilling it. \nA man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  It is not Rath. \nBAIN Fucking God dammit! \nHe hurls the bottle of piss across the room. \nINT. BANK \nThe sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20. After a long beat a single minute clicks off. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM \nThe sun is getting low.  The room much darker now. \nBain sits at the window; his body a knot. \nA large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's eyes light up.  One by one, the scope passes over each face. \nThey trickle down the steps and into the plaza. \nThe stairs are again empty. \nBain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting open the floor. \nHe looks at the bank.  Nothing.  He checks his watch.  In fifteen minutes the bank will close. \nHe stands up. \nEXT. CAFE \nElectra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain emerges from the shadows. \nELECTRA Oh my God. \nHe is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't get out of his way. \nELECTRA He's coming. \nINT. BANK \nRath looks up at the clock, smiles. \nRATH Four minutes. \nELECTRA What? \nRATH I waited another four minutes. \nELECTRA Shit. \nRATH Wait until he is on the stairs. \nELECTRA Right. \nRATH I'm taking off my mike. \nELECTRA Okay. \nRATH Electra -- \nELECTRA What? \nRATH Last night -- \nEXT. CAFE \nElectra smiles. \nELECTRA Was nice. \nRATH Yes. \nShe sees Bain storming up the stairs.  She stands, tosses several bills on the table and leaves. \nHe's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone. He's out the door. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the hotel. \nIn her ear she hears Rath. \nRATH (V.O.) Electra? \nShe shrieks. \nINT. BANK \nRath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the case. \nRATH Electra? \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra is frantic. \nELECTRA God, I can't find it!  I can't find it!  I can't find the fucking gun! \nINT. BANK \nFor Rath, everything has changed. \nEXT. PLAZA \nIn long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square, twisting, glancing back, watching. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra nears the room below the fifth story window. \nELECTRA It wasn't with his other stuff! \nINT. BANK \nRath is now afraid. \nRATH Electra, get out. \nEXT. SIDE STREET \nBain nears the opening in the plywood wall. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor. \nRATH (V.O.) He's coming, Electra!  Get out now! \nELECTRA Oh, God.  I see it! \nShe reaches for it, but it's too high. \nRATH (V.O.) Electra, listen!  You have got to come to the bank for the money!  The money! \nShe is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back toward the stairs. \nJust as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO THE LOBBY below. \nShe begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly. \nBain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs. \nINT. BANK \nThe bank is almost empty.  Rath has begun to sweat. \nRATH Electra! \nThe Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of the green paper blocks. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her. \nRATH (V.O.) Electra! \nThe voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off, stuffing it in her pocket. \nINT. BANK \nRATH Electra, what's happening?  What are you -- \nThe Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut. \nOFFICIAL Finido, senor. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nElectra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the fifth floor.  There is no time. \nShe slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner into the room.  He rushes to the window, slamming himself against it. \nBAIN You're gonna take me?  Come on! Come on, motherfucker! \nHe bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls out the assault rifle. \nHe falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS. \nShe watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him. \nThe gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but he is gone. \nEXT. PLAZA \nRath races wildly across the darkening market square. \nINT. BURNED HOTEL \nBain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS. \nBAIN Die, bitch! \nHe FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the floor around her feet. \nScreaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall. \nHis shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and rises, listening as -- \nShe sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall. \nBeneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase, waiting, until -- \nElectra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that they are exposed. \nShe flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is PERFORATED with BULLETS. \nBAIN Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you doing?  I don't believe this is happening! \nShe can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall, above; there is nowhere to go. \nBAIN You're dead!  You're fucking dead! I'm going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this! \nBain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves he'll know her position. \nHe FIRES another. \nElectra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. \nAnother SHOT. \nShe FIRES back. \nBain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS, flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets. \nHer gun empties first. \nHe laughs hearing the CLICK. \nBAIN Game over, bitch! \nRATH Bain! \nRath's scream ECHOES up through the building. \nBefore Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream- like grid resembling a chess board. \nElectra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. \nThe two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she races back to the room. \nBAIN Fuck no! \nRath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty. \nRATH Shit! \nBain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to the end of the hall. \nRath sees it all happening. \nRATH Electra! \nBain snaps into a targeting stance. \nElectra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly touching the floor -- \nTELESCOPIC SIGHT \nWhen the cross-hairs find her back. \nBACK TO SCENE \nRATH Electra! \nTime becomes syrup. \nRATH Down!  Get down! \nBain FIRES. \nElectra dives. \nThe blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her. \nShe bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room. \nBain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the stairs. \n", "test1_input": "\"Assassins\", early draft, by Larry & Andy Wachowski \nASSASSINS \nWritten by \nLarry and Andy Wachowski \nAugust 12, 1994 \nFADE IN: \nPERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK \nWe know that we are looking at something because its polished surface shimmers with light. \nPULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and white tiles of a chess board. \nThe board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess game. \nThe pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies unravel towards a final outcome. \nStanding above the pieces around him, we see the black king. \nWe MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold black eyes... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK \nThe red setting sun is reflected in the black lens. \nTwo men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end- less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the mire. \nThe man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man. He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand. \nHis name is ROBERT RATH. \nThe other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the brambles and mud. \nAs he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the mud. \nKETCHAM Aw-shit! \nHe balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud. He looks at Rath. \nKETCHAM How much farther? \nRATH Just a little ways.  Up to those trees. \nAbout a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees. \nKETCHAM Oh, fuck it. \nHe pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud. He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off, laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud. \nRath waits, a faint smile. \nHe manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark, wet earth. \nKETCHAM Hey, this feels kinda good. \nThey move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE. \nKETCHAM Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess. \nRATH Sure. \nKETCHAM Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really. \nRATH Why not? \nKETCHAM I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her. \nHe picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball. \nKETCHAM My Margaret... I loved her but you know what?  I cheated on her.  All the time.  I don't even know why. It wasn't the sex, Margaret was great in bed.  I think if I wasn't married I wouldn't have even looked at some of those women.  I knew she couldn't trust me, so how could I trust her?  If she was here right now I'd think that I would tell her that I was sorry... 'course, if she were here right now, maybe I wouldn't feel like talking. \nHe throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far. \nKETCHAM I think I've heard of you. \nRATH It's possible. \nKETCHAM You're pretty famous aren't you? \nRATH I hope not. \nKETCHAM I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering. \nRATH It's a common question. \nKETCHAM Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle. \nRATH A dime. \nKETCHAM One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot? \nRATH Average. \nKETCHAM Shit... oh well. \n", "test1_true": "KETCHAM I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway? \nRATH Taken. \nKETCHAM 'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them. \nRATH Everyone who plays the game knows the rules. \nKETCHAM That's exactly what I told myself. \nKetcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like he's high. \nKETCHAM I always wondered what I'd be thinking at this exact moment.  I imagined that I would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this, trying to figure out who it was... \nSomething occurs to him and he looks back at Rath. \nRATH Don't know.  That's how it works. \nKETCHAM That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that? \nRATH Right. \nKETCHAM I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me. \nRATH What are you thinking about? \nKETCHAM I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one. \nRATH And an R.C. \nHe's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees. \nKETCHAM Can I ask you something? \nRATH Go ahead. \nKETCHAM What do other guys do? \nHe looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND. \nRATH Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not. \nKETCHAM Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying? \nRATH Some. \nKETCHAM When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good. \nRATH Can I ask you a question? \nKETCHAM Anything. \nRATH Why didn't you fade? \nKETCHAM You mean quit? \nRATH Yeah. \nKETCHAM I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand? \nRATH Yeah. \nKetcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees. \nKETCHAM I always pictured that I would end in some land fill, under someone else's garbage.  I kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some baby's green shit, covering me.  But this is nice... \nHe looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black horizon. \nKETCHAM Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind? \nRATH No. \nKetcham stares at the last of the light. \nKETCHAM Nice... real nice. \nWith his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry. \nRath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand. \nWhen the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark- ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE SHOTS. \nKetcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud, a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze left by the dying sun. \nRath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand- ing alone in the middle of nowhere. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe room is dark and still. \nA man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light. \nSnow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the city's electric night. \nThe man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window. \nIn the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath. \nOutside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below. \nHe is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door. \n", "test1_id": 2142, "test2_input": "RATH Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma. \nBAIN No shit. \nRATH Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad. \nBAIN Yeah. \nRATH But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably. \nBAIN Probably. \nRATH I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair. \nBain allows himself a bemused smile. \nBAIN Sizzle lean. \nThe cab passes the intersection for the airport. \nBain sits up. \nBAIN What are you doing? \nRATH What? \nBAIN That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport. \nRATH You're right.  Talking too much again. \nBAIN Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal. \nRATH What?  You think I'm running you up? \nBAIN Just do your job. \nRath pulls over and slaps the cab in park. \nBAIN What are you doing? \nRATH Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out. \nBAIN You can't -- \nRATH The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out! \nBain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the dashboard and the missing ID. \nTheir eyes meet in the rearview mirror. \nBAIN Holy fucking shit! \nThe cab rocks as both men move.  Instantly guns fill their hands.  Bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the dead cops.  Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free from his jacket. \nBain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  He looks at Rath.  He wants him to run.  Anyone who moves away from the bullet proof glass is dead. \nBoth men are silent, each holding the other in their gun sights. \nBain blinks, sweat forming on his lip. \nBAIN I get out, you got me. \nBain reaches over and closes the door.  He smiles knowing it is the right move. \nBAIN Now what? \nRath calmly uncocks his gun. \nRATH We're both going to the airport. \nBain nods. \nRATH Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on. \nBAIN No fucking way. \nRATH Okay, don't. \nBain thinks. \nRATH If either of us fucks around, the other can blow the fuel line. \nHe points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs. \nBain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath. \nRath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his gun on the fuel line. \nHe puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic, turning back towards Peterson. \nThey sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit the expressway.  Bain can't contain himself, giddy on adrenaline. \nBAIN Jesus -- I'm being driven to the airport by Robert Rath. \nHe laughs. \nBAIN I can't believe this.  You rolled some cabby for the radio, then waited for an airport fare. \nHe laughs again. \nBAIN Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that! \n", "test2_true": "BAIN Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name. \nHe leans back.  This is a big moment for him. \nBAIN Bain.  Michael Bain. \nRATH How long have you been freelance? \nBAIN Two years.  Two long fucking years. \nSomething occurs to him and he leans close to the window. \nBAIN Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done. \nRATH It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds. \nBAIN Sounds like chickenshit -- \nHe laughs hard. \nBAIN Listen to me calling you chickenshit! \nHe stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's head. \nBAIN Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs! Wigs are the worst part of this job. I'd rather dye my hair than wear a wig. \nRath studies him. \nRATH You're wearing a wig now. \nBain chokes on his laugh. \nBAIN God damn are you good.  Everyone says you're so fucking good.  I just can't believe I'm still alive.  If I believed in God, I'd be down on my knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come you just didn't plug us all when we came through the door? \nRath does not answer.  Bain smiles.  He knows something about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people. \nBAIN Shit if I was you, back there -- \nHe holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's head. \nBAIN Game over. \nHe laughs. \nBAIN Do you mind if I ask you a couple of business questions?  You know I was wondering how much you bid this job at? \nRath says nothing. \nBAIN You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing? \nRATH We both know what you were doing. \nBain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's gun. \nBAIN Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight inch silencer.  Classic.  When I first heard you used that, I thought, shit, that's a lady's gun. Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real clean. \nHe looks at the gun, still trained at the floor. \nBAIN Would you really blow us? \nRath does not have to answer. \nBAIN Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov -- \nRATH Tachlinkov. \nBAIN Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right? \nRath says nothing. \nBAIN I bet I'm right. \nThe car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the Cleveland airport. \nBAIN Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ! \nRATH After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland. \nBAIN Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get. \nA long beat of silence. \nThe CAB RUMBLES up onto the \"departures\" ramp which circles past all of the terminals. \nBAIN So what happens now? \nRATH We go around once. \nBAIN Bullshit. \nHe throws off his seatbelt. \nBAIN You tell me that we're gonna go around once, then, while I'm checking out the lay of the land, you bail out and send me flying over the bridge.  Right?  Am I right? \nRath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the police and airport security. \nRath studies the terrain.  Bain studies Rath. \nSoon they have passed the entire airport.  Rath nods. Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle interchange that will bring them to the beginning. \nBain wipes the sweat from his face. \n", "test2_id": 2143, "test3_input": "Cramped in the corner is Bain.  He is PLAYING \"TETRIS,\" wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL into his ears. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra continues to pace, checking the monitors. \nINT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN \nAt the switchboard, a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing the order in the hotel computer. \nYOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE) Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about thirty minutes.  You're welcome. \nHe turns around and Rath is right behind him. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nThe fourteenth floor; the BELL CHIMES, the doors slide open and the clump of Japanese men get out. \nJust as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out. \nINT. HALL \nBain follows them down the hall, still PLAYING the GAME. There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on its prey. \nAs Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst open, a large family, heading for the pool. \nThe moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and Bain continues down the hall again, PLAYING the GAME. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nWhen the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance camcorders and microphones are mounted in various locations to display every inch of the room.  The group hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes. \nThe four goons have their hands in their jackets. \nA small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles. \nELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.) Good morning, gentlemen.  I apologize for the arrangement, but we all know those aren't business cards you're reaching for.  If anyone leaves this room, the deal's off. \nINT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN \nThe operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner. \nRath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the information rolling by. \nWe see that it is the previous night's room service receipts. \nRATH One vegetarian plate and a can of tuna fish.  Room 1014. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra stands in front of the monitors watching the men as she speaks into the microphone. \nELECTRA Ten thousand dollars per disk. Insert the first disk now. \nOn the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the first disk into the laptop disk drive. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nAkira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar bills, down the central air duct. \nThe little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies. \nINT. HYATT HALL \nBain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of \"TETRIS.\" \nSuddenly, he stops. \nBAIN Yes! \nThe display of the game reads \"Game Over\" and congratulates Bain on a new high score. \nBain stands, smiling.  He puts the game in his pocket and starts down the hall. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another stack of money, stuffing it into her bag. \nA LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up at the monitor. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nThe lock on the door has been broken and standing in the frame is Bain. \nBAIN Surprise! \nHe raises his arm, his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly. \nELECTRA Oh, God. \nINT. HOTEL SUITE \nAnother SHOT and the second bodyguard falls.  The other two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the lifeless body of his first victim. \nThey FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him. \nBain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall dead.  He lets his human shield fall to the ground and levels his gun on the shaking Akira. \n", "test3_true": "Bain looks at him and smiles, then FIRES. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM \nElectra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the modem. \nBain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it. \nBAIN (V.O.) Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust anyone these days. \nHe licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva. \nShe stuffs the disks into her bag.  She puts Nikita in her \"travel kitty\" and charges for the door, grabbing her coat. \nFlinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from the room. \nINT. HALL \nElectra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes. She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22. \nRATH Don't be stupid and you will live. \nThe elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel lobby ashtray.  He waves her into the elevator with his gun. \nRATH Hurry. \nEXT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY \nElectra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open street. \nINT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY \nThe door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, is the same as Electra had left it when she ran out. \nJutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's letter. \nINT. ELECTRA'S CAR \nElectra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the rear window. \nRATH Turn here. \nNo one follows.  He turns back to her. \nRATH How many bodies were there? \nHe checks his watch. \nELECTRA What? \nRATH He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there? \nELECTRA Um, five. \nRATH One hour per man. \nRath sets the timer on his watch for five hours. \nINT. HYATT HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nBain has returned to room 1414.  Wearing rubber gloves, he clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of rug cleaner. \nHe picks up the phone for room service. \nBAIN Hi.  This is room 1414 -- \nBehind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  He is naked. \nBAIN Yes, could you send up a pot of coffee and my friends are going to need some more towels.  Thanks. \nHe hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large blood stains on the carpet.  He points the rug cleaner at the stain covering it with white foam. \nINT. ELECTRA'S CAR \nRath sees the entrance for the expressway. \nRATH Get on the expressway. \nELECTRA Where are we going? \nRath glances back. \nRATH Nowhere yet. \nElectra turns onto the highway and NIKITA HOWLS from the \"travel kitty\" in the back seat. \nELECTRA Nikita, hush. \nNIKITA wants out and HOWLS again. \nELECTRA She won't stop unless you let her out. \nRath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into the front seat onto Rath's lap. \nRATH Nikita?  She helped me find you. \nELECTRA What?  How did you know I had a cat? \nRATH Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right. \nELECTRA Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for? \n", "test3_id": 2144}

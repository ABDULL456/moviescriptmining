Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags, a newly bought suitcase. They see... 
COPS 
They freeze, turn, ready to bolt. But more cops behind them. A panic, yet no one's coming after them. They walk on. The cops are going into and coming out of Belinda's room. 
INT. BELINDA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The fat Blonde Woman is talking to a policewoman. James sits on the bed staring at... 
BELINDA 
who lies dead on a floor littered with crack vials. Hull picks up a vial, holds it up to the Blonde Woman with a question. 
BLONDE WOMAN (nodding) She got a fever and just burned up. She just burned up all of a sudden. It must have been bad stuff. 
MCCUTCHEON (indicating James) He shouldn't be here. 
BLONDE WOMAN (takes his hand) Come on, James, we'll go get a burrito. 
The boy allows himself to be led out. Betty looks at Hull who's in a private hell. 
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 
Hull and Betty are about to enter Hull's room. The door is ajar. 
INT. HULL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Taft stands at the dresser. He's found Hull's collection of memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children. 
TAFT Cute kids... 
HULL (angry at the invasion) Give me that. 
He snatches away the photo, but not before Betty sees it. She reaches out her hand. He reluctantly turns it over to her. 
TAFT Tell me something, who the fuck are you? 
Hull doesn't answer, collects the rest of his things, including the bloody money, stuffs it back in the envelope. 
TAFT (continuing) 'Cause I don't think you're quite the asshole you're trying to be. 
HULL Look, Mr. Taft, that's your name, right? Leave me alone. I got things on my mind. 
TAFT I'd think you would. You better have your goddamn life on your mind, or it's gonna get away from you. It's gonna burn up like that poor woman across the way. Like all of you's gonna burn... 
HULL And what do you do, Mr. Taft, except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner, never catching anybody important? 
TAFT I do what I can. Do you do what you can? (Hull says nothing) Maybe my partner was dirty. Maybe the chief's dirty. And the mayor. And the President. Maybe God Himself's taking something on the side. That's their problem. But I'll bust 'em if I can. 
HULL (without force) Get out of my room. 
TAFT Don't deny who you are. 
He leaves. Hull turns to Betty who is still holding the photo of his children. He gently takes it, looks at it, seems to draw both succor and pain from it. 
He gets out Carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty. 
HULL They're my children. They live in Cleveland with their mother. I'm divorced from her. I haven't seen them in... some time. I want to, but I haven't been able to arrange it. 
MCCUTCHEON How much else don't I know about you? 
HULL (trying to make a joke) Everything else... Everything else is... I don't know. 
MCCUTCHEON Taft has all the evidence about my laundering. 
Hull's upset. 
MCCUTCHEON He's going to put me in jail for a long time unless I give you up. 
HULL Do it. 
MCCUTCHEON I can't. So, I've got to get away. Far away. But I need money. 
HULL (laughs) Money? I got money...

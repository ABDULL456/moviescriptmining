She bolts up screaming directly into Jeffrey's face.  Her beaten face and milky eyes are a study in horror.

208A. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jeffrey arrives at Dorothy's apartment building and pays the driver. He gets out of the cab and looks around.  No police.  Quiet.  The building looks just the same standing there in the dark.  The dim lights in the front entrance.  Jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters. No one.

210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building. 
He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees something and jumps back. 
211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room. 
FLASHBACK 
He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again. 
CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON 
Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands almost motionless. in shock. 
Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing. 
Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and motionless again.  The radio talks again. 
RADIO VOICE #1 Get back and stay down. 
RADIO VOICE #2 . It's apartment eight. 
Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play. Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio. 
RADIO VOICE #2 (continuing) I'm sending Jack and Pete to the roof. It's. 
RADIO VOICE #1 Hey. 
Sounds of shots. 
RADIO VOICE #1 (continuing) He's shooting. from the second window. 
RADIO VOICE #3 Stay in place. 
RADIO VOICE #2 Jack. get up there quick. can return fire?. 
RADIO VOICE #3 I think he's alone. but return fire to second window only. 
Many shots. 
We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

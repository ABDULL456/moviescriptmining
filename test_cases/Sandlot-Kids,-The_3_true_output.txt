SCOTTY (DAZED) Uh... neat. 
NARRATOR It was salt in an open wound. Even my own mom, who was only a grown-up girl, knew who Babe Ruth was. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
The gang's all here. Big plans. War conference. 
SCOTTY So, how do we get it back? 
SQUINTS I have no idea. 
NARRATOR I was dead meat. I knew it. They knew it. We had thought that those cards Benny had gotten meant that something great was going to happen. Now I figured that they'd just meant my life was over. 
SCOTTY Can't we just hop the fence and get it? 
HAM Remember Davy Stodenrous. 
TIMMY/REPEAT Poor Toad. 
SCOTTY Oh, yeah. I forgot. (A THOUGHT) Hey? Why don't we just go over there and knock on the door, and ask Mr. Mertle to get it for us? 
Everyone looks at Scotty - the kid just sprouted a dunce cap. 
SQUINTS Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle is the meanest old man that ever lived! He's the one that sicked The Beast on The Toad! (BEAT) That's not an option, Smalls. Forget about it. 
SCOTTY Oh. Okay. I will. 
Silent moments... not a single blinking idea between them. Then, suddenly: 
SQUINTS We need to assess the situation! 
GANG (better than nothing) Of course! Right! Good one, Squints! Access (sic) the situation! Okay! 
BERTRAM Um, Squints? How do we do that? 
SQUINTS First we survey the enemy's environment, then we make note of the surrounding terrain. 
HAM What?... 
SQUINTS (COPPING) I heard that on "Combat." Let's just look out the window. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
The gang pokes their heads-only through the window. They look down into: 
EXT. THE BADLANDS (MR. MERTLE'S BACKYARD) - DAY 
The house is a godforsaken stucco'd corpse. 
THE YARD 
is the final resting place for: melted frisbees, withered kickballs, skeletons of heat-crumbled paper kites, an airforce of exposure-splintered balsa wood gliders, and a fleet of model rockets - their drag-chutes turning to dust. And hundreds of little empty craters - that used to cradle baseballs. 
THE RUSTY TOW CHAIN 
snakes through the dirt - buried then exposed. It terminates 'NEATH 
THE LEAN-TO 
from under which rises hazy twirls of dust. The dust is kept from ever settling by some enormous ORGANIC EXHAUST. 
A GIANT PAW-THING 
emerges from under the lean-to, pushing the Babe Ruth autographed cowhide into full view - "I dare you..." 
INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
The guys jerk their heads back inside. 
TIMMY He's darin' us! 
REPEAT He's darin' us! 
DENUNEZ He's waitin' for us, man. Just like he did with The Toad. 
GANG (REVERENT) Poor Toad. 
HAM We're on his territory now. 
BERTRAM Think he's pissed? 
BENNY Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got any bright ideas? 
THE BIG MONTAGE STARTS WITH: 
A tree house debate. Much shouting. Much disagreement. Many hands miming mechanical contraptions. 
NARRATOR We had absolutely no idea what the hell we were gonna do. So things started primitively. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY 
The gang hurries out from the Timmons' yard carrying a broom stick. They wriggle it under the fiberglass fence. Squints peers through the peep hole motioning directions to Ham. Suddenly - SNAP! Ham pulls the stick back. 'Tis toothpick'd. 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
The guys fell the clothes line pole with a hack saw. 6 feet of inch thick pipe. They heft it up - go out to

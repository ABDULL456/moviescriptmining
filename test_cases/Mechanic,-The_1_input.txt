INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY 
A huge square filled with VENDORS selling all manner of food and good out of CARTS and STALLS. Music, voices, crowds of people. Bishop moves through. Dressed average, just a guy in the crowd. He watches a couple argue. Moves on... 
BISHOP (V.O.) It's not good enough to simply follow your Mark and attack him. Most of these people know they're targets. They'll be watching for you. ... A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking Bishop. 
BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) You need to understand the location, control the situation. You're looking for escapes, security, police presence... Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce trucks towards the row of shops that border the square. 
INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS 
Bishop stands in front of a case, watches the precision instruments tick. From behind a counter, the Chinese OWNER notices him, puts down the watch he's repairing, approaches. 60's, authoritative, a LOUP on his forehead. 
OWNER Interest you in anything? Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective surfaces, back to the man. Bishop points to a watch. 
BISHOP That's a beauty. 
OWNER 
(BEAMING) You know your instruments... 
EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - CONTINUOUS 
Concealed amidst exotic Guatemalan wraps, Steve tracks the Watch Shop. The attractive older woman running the stall eyes him. He looks right through her. STEVE'S P.O.V.: Bishop exits, heading back into the market. 
BISHOP (V.O.) Most of all, you need to answer this question: "How does this man die here today?" Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat. Steve follows behind Bishop, lost in the sea of people. 
BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everybody, everyday, has a way to die. You have to find it. 
EXT. CURIOS STALL, OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
Bishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys, rocking horses, vintage dolls. His gaze finds a large, still- boxed doll of the "Luna Cromwell" character that the Grocery Owner's Daughter is obsessed with. Almost life-sized. 
SALESMAN They don't make that anymore. That's a classic. I can let you have it for three hundred... 
INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 
Bishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll. A GROUP of teens RUNS by Bishop, buffeting him for a moment. Slightly off kilter, he checks his surroundings. Nothing. Bishop starts again, aware for the first time that a MAN is headed his direction, passing a knife-sharpening stand, blades gleaming, his face hidden by a low hat... Bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye, turns and pushes through the tight space between two stalls, out the back where trucks are parked. Bishops glances back for the man, squeezes between two large trucks... ...coming out the other side when POP! A loud SOUND makes Bishop glance over. A HISSING coming from one of the trucks which starts to ROLL backwards and Suddenly HANDS are on Bishop from behind, PUSHING HIM backwards, into the space between the two trucks! A FLASH, A SPLIT SECOND to stare into Steve's face, holding him there to be crushed and... 
CRASH! The one truck SLAMS into the second, the vice closed, metal crumpling. Bishop, at the last minute pulled back by Steve who's holding him there, smiling. A beat. Bishop checks the surroundings, nods. Steve release him. 
BISHOP ...Good. Very good. 
STEVE Good? That's all you got? How about God damn perfect, man? 
BISHOP Don't get cocky. 
STEVE Broad daylight. A thousand witnesses. Man takes a wrong step. Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself. Because that was poetry. (laughing, smiling) You just can't bring yourself to be impressed, can you? Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it. 
STEVE (CONT'D) (hand to his ear) What's that? You're what? Oh, you are impressed? No, come on, you don't have to say that. Really, I'm fine with -- You what? You've never seen someone better? Wow. 
BISHOP All right. You did very well. 
STEVE Damn straight I did. And now, in celebration of me, I'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses... what? Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve. Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's hands. A confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon. 
STEVE (CONT'D) ...Bishop? 
BISHOP There's a man behind me. Look up once, then look away. Don't look back. Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over his store, closing for the day. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) You got him? 
STEVE Yeah. Look...

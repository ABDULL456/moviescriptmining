Beat. 
GLASSY EYED MAN Are you sure? 
The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it. The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. 
MAN IN HOUSE What are you doing? 
The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening... It opens slowly anyway. 
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: 
David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable. 
David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man. 
He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive. He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM. 
The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. 
David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station Maintenance Staff Only". 
Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his bin inside. 
David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the doors. 
And then they open. 
The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit. 
David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 
The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet behind. 
The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves. 
He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. 
David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT 
The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM. 
A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or three days worth. 
David shuts the door very slowly. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE KITCHEN. 
David stares out from under his hood at the mess. 
Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl. 
David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open quietly. 
A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in a pyramid on the coffee table. 
David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense. 
THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM. 
David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

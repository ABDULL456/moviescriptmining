EXT.  STREET - NIGHT 
Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among the street crowd who don't even notice her.  She holsters the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.  The sky explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off overhead.  A crack like thunder follows.  Then more flashes. 
The countdown to midnight has begun.  The party is building to a crescendo.  It seems to have a surreal, nightmarish quality.  She passes a MIME in a clock suit, who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SUITE 2203 
As Lenny enters the suite.  It is very quiet.  Dark. 
Lenny's heart is pounding.  He moves through the luxurious suite, gun in the low-ready position. 
Lenny can barely breathe from the tension.  He notices that one balcony door is open.  The roar of the crowd comes in like the sound of surf from far below.  Fireworks explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant screams of slaughter. 
His feet crunch on broken glass... a shattered champagne bottle.  A lamp is knocked over.  He reaches the door to the bedroom and looks in.  The room is empty.  The bed is unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off.  This isn't right.  None of this is right. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET PARTY/HOTEL 
Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking for a way back in.  She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the crowd, not twenty feet from her.  He is looking right at her.  Not recognizing her for a moment.  Then... he realizes who she is. 
He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the way, breaking into a run.  Engelman charges after her, pulling out his rover to call Spreg. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE 
Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically. He opens it... 
... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE falls out into his hand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  STREET - NIGHT 
Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the crowd.  Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He hammers through anybody that gets in his way. 
Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian runner. 
Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her pass. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE 
LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches down. 
IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite. 
Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls it across the room, and it shatters against the wall. 
We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer. Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer. 
FAITH Oh.  I didn't hear you come in. 
THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up. 
THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We turn her onto her back. 
She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed. 
The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair. 
LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head in horror... 
LENNY No, no, no... 
IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full length. 
Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight. She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body, which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife deftly cuts off her panties. 
We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us. 
ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape. 
BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt slowly. 
LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares wildly around the room. 
One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door. 
Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet. 
It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.

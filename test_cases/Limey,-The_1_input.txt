Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He simply drops it. 
WILSON 
Now stands before him. 
THE TWO OF THEM 
Both breathing hard. 
WILSON Tell me. 
This is not what Valentine expected. 
VALENTINE What. 
WILSON Tell me. 
VALENTINE Tell you ... 
WILSON About Jenny. (closer) Tell me about Jenny. (closer) About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard. 
Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling Valentine. 
WILSON Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking bastard. 
Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a response. 
VALENTINE She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything. 
WILSON Why then.  Why did you do it! 
They're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious. 
VALENTINE She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd turn me in. 
WILSON 
Shock of recognition on his face.  At those words. 
VALENTINE She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll turn you in, Terry." 
Wilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them. Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it. Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions. 
VALENTINE She was serious.  She would have done it. She had the phone in her hand.  She was going to do it. 
WILSON 
Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished. He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of Valentine behind. 
CUT. 
INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. 
Adhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall. They stare at each other. 
CUT. 
INT. PLANE.  DAY. 
Wilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it. 
WILSON Ta. 
After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with. 
FLASH CUTS: 
WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing. 
ELAINE. Cleaning his wound. 
Wilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight Attendant. 
LADY You're English. 
A small beat (which he takes each time he responds). 
WILSON Yeah, that's right. 
LADY I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back. 
WILSON

EDDIE I can take care of you now. 
LINDY That was never what I wanted. 
EDDIE A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you. 
Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely. 
LINDY You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty. 
She gets up, turns away from him. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
LINDY (CONT'D) I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life. 
There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard before. A matter-of-fact chill. 
LINDY (CONT'D) But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human? 
She heads for the door. 
LINDY (CONT'D) I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me. 
She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's done with him. 
EXT. W HOTEL - LATER 
Eddie at the WINDOW, looking down... 
EXT. EDDIE'S POV - THE STREET 
He sees Lindy briskly walking away. RACK FOCUS as Lindy passes... GENNADY. Leaning against a sign post. Lighting a cigarette. And looking up at Eddie's hotel. Waiting. 
EXT. W HOTEL - DAY 
Gennady stands there, looking up at the hotel. So he's a little surprised to find EDDIE walking right up to him. 
EDDIE Looking for me? 
Gennady quickly gets aggressive: 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
GENNADY You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are? 
EDDIE I was under the impression that our business was settled. 
Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink. 
GENNADY Walk. 
Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie remains cool. 
EDDIE So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman. 
GENNADY I want some more of that shit. 
EDDIE What shit. 
GENNADY The pills. 
He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT, doesn't react. 
EDDIE Well, so do I. You took the last one. 
GENNADY So you get me more. 
EDDIE I can't get more -- the dealer's dead. 
Now Gennady smiles. 
GENNADY Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Eddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his business life. But he stands his ground. 
EDDIE Nothing. I. Can. Do. 
GENNADY Make some calls. One hundred pills. 
EDDIE A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on-- 
The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin. 
GENNADY You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages. 
EDDIE I might... be able to get ten. 
GENNADY Ten. Fuck your ten.

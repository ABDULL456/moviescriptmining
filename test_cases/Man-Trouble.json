CAMPUS REHEARSAL ROOM/ANGLE ON CONDUCTOR               4 He begins to sing aggressively over the duet. He suddenly drops his hands to his side. The organist discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off: \nLEWIE Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here... (hitting at the score) ... because I swear, I don't see it. \nJOAN Sorry.   I didn't know I was. \nLEWIE Also, I'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note. \n(CONTINUED) \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/23/91                            2. \n4   CONTINUED:                                                 4 He returns his attention to the score. While Joan grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus (EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the others: JOAN I wasn't smearing. \nHELEN Sssh, come on now. \nJOAN No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike...                           * LEWIE Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd like to take it once again.

He sits in an adjacent chair, an abject hostage. \nDiscomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL can be heard. ADELE I feel like he's not plugged into my needs, and I'm not getting enough positive feedback... \nJUNE HUFF, enters from a door of the rear of the office. Moving past Harry's desk, she picks up a folded newspaper page, continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window, lies down and begins reading. HARRY (moving to his desk) Now don't start lazing around, June. Let's get with it. JUNE (under her breath) You get with it. He sits down at his desk and begins going through his drawers, looking for something. She lowers the paper and looks over at him: JUNE (CONT'D) Do you like my hair this way, or do you like it straight? HARRY It's very nice, Sluggo.   Go hose out the kennel. She goes back to reading. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Where the hell are my nail clippers?

Yeah, maybe later today sometime... Who are you addressing? Uh, the executive kennel maid... uh-huh. Yeah. Okay, I'll tell him... So long. \nShe hangs up. HARRY Yeah?   Who was it? \nJUNE Ferde at something Motors. He wants two payments by tomorrow or he's gonna come an' repop the van. HARRY Bastard. \nHe goes back to reading.

I've got enough trouble with Iwo Jima and her complaints, alright? Now the woman doesn't even believe you're my niece. \nJUNE Well, I'm not. HARRY That's not the point I'm making. Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile                  * of bills on top of the desk: \nHARRY You know   what's gonna happen if I can't pay   these damn breeders and get some   adult dogs on the premises?    Pretty damn quick, some asses are   going to hit the pavement,   believe me. \nJUNE So?    I'm sick of dog turds anyway. He scowls at her, then looks out the window: \nHARRY Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the center of a   lot of wealth, the escalation   in crime couldn't be better, and   I'm not turning a damn nickel   on it... He catches sight of something outside:                                 * \nHARRY (CONT'D) Oh shit.    There's Lee. \n18A   EXT.

ANDY'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY                            20 \nJoan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's \"Reverie.\" She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move past the living room window. She resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window, where a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the driveway. \nJoan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she               * finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke. \n23    EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - CLOSE ON DUKE - DAY                       23 \nPosed in an alert stance, Duke breaks into a run, loping gracefully across the lawn to Harry, where he assumes a sitting position upon the command: \n(CONTINUED) \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/23/91                              20A. \n23   CONTINUED:    (A1)                                           23 HARRY Duke, platz!

(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                                   23 HARRY Now, in regard to any   aggressor seeking to give you a   bad time, I want to show you what   you can expect from a dog of   this caliber. \nHe takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to reveal the large scimitar-like canines: HARRY Here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed. (releasing the muzzle) If the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the dog will, excuse me for saying... (\"politely\" indicating his crotch) ... automatically go for the testicles. JOAN Oh god, what if I don't want him to do that? HARRY You want him to do that. JOAN No, I just want him to scare someone. HARRY Believe   me, this will scare them, as well   as incapacitate their mind and any   ability to maneuver against   you. \nJOAN You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't... \nHARRY Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with.

(suddenly mistrustful) But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends. \nHARRY Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher... \nJOAN No, please, don't tell me about that. HARRY Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are... (flicking his cigarettte away) But we're going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby, alright? (indicating her notebook) What've we got there so far? JOAN (reading her notes) Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb. \n(CONTINUED) \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                               23. \n23   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              23 HARRY Well, that's enough for a start on the basic control commands... He scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet know nothing of: \nHARRY (CONT'D) Now let's do a little work with the assailant. \n24   EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE/EXPANSIVE GARDEN AREA - ON JOAN AND          24 HARRY \nShe holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing her in confidential tones: HARRY Alright now, Joan, give him the command, 'Duke, wachen sie.' JOAN Duke, wachen sie. HARRY Good.   The dog is now on alert. \nAs they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds: HARRY This is really a nice piece of real estate you've got here. JOAN (tense and distracted) It's not mine, it's my sister's. \nHARRY Oh, it's your sister's. (pause) And where's she? \nJOAN (looking down at Duke) Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something? \nHARRY Never look at your dog. \n(CONTINUED) \nas Harry unzips the attack jacket: \nJUNE You big flirt. \nHARRY Come on, dumpty, don't start that. (removing the jacket) This is quality clientele. It calls for a certain kind of approach. (nods toward the house) Just soak some of this in, will you? He steps past her and goes to the van: JUNE (giving him the finger) Soak this. As he opens the back panel: HARRY Start to pattern yourself. Breed up. (tossing the jacket inside the van) Observe the woman, for Christ sakes. \nJUNE Oh screw her. He closes the back panel and as he moves past her: \nHARRY You don't screw this type of individual. \nJUNE You would.

(opening the door) Did she even ask me the cost? (as he gets inside) Dammit, I really respect that. \nON JUNE grumbling as she moves to the passenger door: \nJUNE Well I don't, he isn't even your dog. \n27A   OMITTED                                                     27A \n28    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                           28 Joan, her mood light-hearted, enters, with Duke following. She crosses to the closet, selects a change of clothes and moves to lay them out on the bed. Noting the message light blinking on her answering machine, she steps over to the night-stand, presses the playback and to a series of TONES preceding the recorded messages, MOVES OUT OF FRAME. \n29    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT                          29 The indistinct sounds of a TAPED MESSAGE OVER: Joan turns the tap on in the wash basin and begins splashing water on her face. Then as she reaches to a towel and turns the tap off, the WORDS of a popular ROCK SONG can be heard. Exhibiting some curiosity, she exits the bathroom. \n30    INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT                           30 \nJoan stands holding the towel over her   mouth, staring down at the answering machine. Issuing    from it, a MAN'S VOICE in an eerily whispered falsetto,   singing the words, \"Every breath you take, Every move you   make, I'll be watching you.\" \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 5/20/91                           29. \n31   EXT.

A MAN in an adjacent car is staring at her, and momentarily addresses her with a peculiar request: \nMAN How about a little smile. She quickly faces front and as the light changes, accelerates through the intersecion. \n32   INT.

Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and               * see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things. JOAN That's very sweet of you, Harry.

She is well past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine, is not unaware that Harry is looking at her: \nHe lights a cigarette. As she reaches to her glass, his eyes follow the motion of her hands. She looks in front the window: JOAN How long have you been divorced? HARRY Oh, I'd say seven or eight years, around there. \nJOAN And so you  like, well, assuming you live a  single existence, I                       * mean most  men don't seem to enjoy that, I've  read.

Well...

HARRY You're probably quite a singer too. (looking back to her) I'd like to come down and catch you sometime. \nJOAN Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music? \nHARRY Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs. HARRY (CONT'D) I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva. JOAN I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have laughed. \nHARRY Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me.

That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean... HARRY Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah... JOAN You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles: \nJOAN (CONT'D) For some reason, the sublimity of that always touches me. \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                           37.         * \n37B   EXT.

Under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden. JOAN You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends. HARRY It depends on the man and woman you're talking about. They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings: JOAN What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women. HARRY There I disagree with you. \nHe places his hand over hers. She remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then: JOAN You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together. HARRY Is that right? (catching himself) Oh yeah, I forgot that part. \nJOAN Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here. \n(CONTINUED) \n44C   CONTINUED:                                                44C JOAN I know, you told me that, but where are you now?

ANDY Do you understand the implications of this, I have no underpants on, and absolutely no recourse to my rights! Joan sits up, and in her alarm is unaware that one of her hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on Harry's chest, causing him to wince: JOAN Oh God, this is because of Red, isn't it? ANDY Yes, it's because of Red, isn't that obvious!? Evidencing interest in their exchange, Harry manages to reach to his cigarettes on the night stand. \nANDY And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ, think they can ... Wait.

HARRY Well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth. JOAN But she does this, you know, she just periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of bricks. \nHARRY Joan, can I make a suggestion?

JOAN And even if he was a doctor, it doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor. A.C. According to this he was her doctor. JOAN Then who was the doctor who operated on her foot? \nA.C. (looking at screen) There's nothing on here about her foot. It says 'observation for clinical depression.' \nJOAN That's a lie. She was in here for an operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will. \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 5/9/91                                56. \n51   CONTINUED:                                                     51 Presently, the passenger door opens and L.N.

HARRY No, you hear me out, friend... He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the front of the car.

She hands him the skirt out through the window: \nANDY You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me? \nHarry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctor's jacket. ANDY That I   was a pretty, grudge- bearing   little malcontent, grasping at some   splinter of celebrity for myself   at his expense. Can you believe   that? She hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away from her semi-nudity as he hands her the doctor's jacket. \nHARRY Here, put this on. ANDY I mean, the arrogance...

As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it. \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                                 96. \n93   CONTINUED:                                                       93 She sits up, glancing uneasily at Sturge, then attempts to assert herself boldly to Moncrief: \nJOAN As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine... Her bluff is immediately belied by: \nHARRY (O.S.) Honey?    It's me again. Moncrief and Joan look toward the window: \nHARRY (O.S.) I have to tell you something.

He opens the cage and clips the leash to the dog's collar. \nHARRY No, I don't want the dog. \nThe shepherd jumps out to the ground, wagging his tail: LEE (giving him the leash) Go ahead, man. Take him. If you don't want him, pick up some change.

The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above: VOICE (from above) What are you people doing down there? \nJoan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward Joan: \nHARRY Are you crazy?!

In other words, you don't         And later if you find trust me.                         you're unsatisfied with it, we can always get you another one. JOAN Would you please get me my clothes. Moncrief steps in beside Joan: \nMONCRIEF I wanted to tell you a moment ago, that I was privileged to see you at the Bowl on the Fourth of July... \nHARRY So what.   I'm talking to this lady... \nMAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/23/91                             109. \n98   INT. M.P. CENTER/M.D. CENTER - ANDY'S BATHROOM -          98 NIGHT \nAndy pauses in her application of mascara, shifting her gaze to Red's reflection in the mirror as he enters behind her: RED You can't tell me what kind of a woman she was?! And if she was so godammed healthy, why is she dead?! \n99   INT. M.P. CENTER/M.D. CENTER - ANDY'S HOSPITAL            99 ROOM - NIGHT ON Moncrief, Joan and Harry. \nMONCRIEF And I was especially moved by your rendition of 'The Battle Hymn of The...' Harry suddenly grabs Moncrief roughly by the arm: HARRY Never mind that shit.   Tell her... He shakes him, causing him to spill his iced tea onto the front of his jacket: \nHARRY (CONT'D) Did I spend your money! Did I give you any services for it. Tell this woman the truth, you son of a bitch! Harry releases him and under the following, Moncrief takes out a handkerchief and dabs at his jacket: \nMONCRIEF Well, shall we start with the fact that you're a married man... (looking at Harry) ... and then go on from there? \nON JOAN'S REACTION \nDevastated, as she looks at Harry. RED (V.O.) (over the above) Jesus Christ! What are you trying to do to me!!

As she disappears inside, Red re-enters, and covering the speaker vents on the beeper, strides over to Moncrief: \nRED You know whose heart this body- snatcher is trying to give me?! A victim of somebody called the Westside Slasher! And this is the doctor you recommended to me! (into the beeper) You're killing me, Monroe! You know that?! You're pushing me to the goddamned wall! Joan comes out of the bathroom with the doctor's jacket and moves immediately to the hallway door and exits. \n99A   EXT. M.P. CENTER/HALLWAY - NIGHT                             99A Joan moves quickly down the hall, putting the doctor's jacket on over her hospital smock, with Harry following, trying desperately to explain: \nHARRY Honey,   there's a simple explanation to all   of this, if you want me to go into   it... I was trying to tell you at   dinner... She disappears into an intersecting hallway. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Will you just stop for one minute and let me talk to you... It's very complicated... \n", "test3_true": "99B   INT. M.P. CENTER - ANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     99B \nRed, slumped in a chair and looking in desperation to Andy, who enters, now fully dressed and looking as glamorous as a movie star: \nRED What in the hell should I do?!

ANDY'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - INSIDE JOAN'S CAR - NIGHT        100 \nJoan sits in dejected silence, refusing to look at Harry: \nHARRY Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along. JOAN I would never have knowingly become involved with a married man. HARRY I know that, that's why I was trying to come out and tell you... \nJOAN Please, I don't want to discuss it anymore. (after a brief silence) I bet you never read Dante, either. \nHARRY Now there you're 75 percent wrong. JOAN I mean, I can't believe it, that you'd lie to me about this... HARRY Okay, I lied. Didn't you ever tell a lie? If not let me kiss your high heel. JOAN I'm going in the house.

Can I call you tomorrow, just to see how you're feeling? Or how things are going? JOAN I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a concert on Friday. That's all I care about right now. She reaches to the door handle, then very emotionally: \nJOAN (CONT'D) And I don't want to see you anymore. \nHARRY Don't say that, please. I'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life, because... JOAN No. I didn't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators... HARRY Well, I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch, and the prince of whatever, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't, when it comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you. She finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with tears: JOAN That's not what I observed, Harry. \nShe opens the door and gets out. \nHARRY'S POV \nas Joan crosses the driveway to the house, moves up the steps to the front door and disappears inside. \n(CONTINUED) \n100    CONTINUED:    (2)                                          100 BACK TO SCENE \nHe remains seated for a moment, glancing briefly down at the watch on his wrist.

On his way, he glances somberly over his shoulder at the house. In so doing his gaze falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the Mercedes. He stops and walks back to the car. Once again, he takes hold of the ax handle and makes several attempts to dislodge it. In a final Arthurian effort, the blade yields and he pulls the ax free. He suddenly steps back away from the car, as a steamy spray of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top of the hood. Then he glances guiltily toward the house, and moves to his van with Duke following. \n101A   EXT. HOUSE OF BLISS/INSIDE HARRY'S VAN - DAY               101A Harry, his suitcase and clothes in the front seat and Duke in bed of the van, parks in front of the House of Bliss: \nHIS POV - FOR LEASE SIGN in the plate glass window. \n101B   EXT.

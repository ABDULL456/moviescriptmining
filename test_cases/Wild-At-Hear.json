THUNDERBIRD - STREETS OF NUNEZ - NIGHT \nLula and Sailor cruise the dark streets. \nLULA I wouldn\u0092t mind a little night life. How about you? \nSAILOR Hard to tell what\u0092s shakin\u0092 in a place like this, honey.  You don\u0092t want to be walkin\u0092 in the wrong door. \nLULA Maybe there\u0092s a place we could hear some music.  I feel like dancin\u0092. We could ask someone. \n97. EXT. RED DEVIL GAS STATION - NIGHT \nSailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and pulls the car over. \nSAILOR Someone up here might know somethin\u0092. \nTwo skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls walk over to them. \nBUCK Gas? \nSAILOR Got enough, thanks.  We\u0092re lookin\u0092 for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin\u0092 - get somethin\u0092 to eat, too.  Anything like that around here? \nBILLY Cornbread\u0092s.  They got western. \nBUCK No food, though, \u0092cept bar nibbles. \nLula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor. \nLULA How about speed metal? \nThe kids look worried and take a step back. \nLULA Any kinda rock\u0092n\u0092roll, honey. \nBILLY There\u0092s a boogie joint just about a mile straight out Lafitte here.  But that\u0092s a black place mostly. \nBUCK Mostly black though in that boogie place. \nSAILOR What\u0092s the name of it? \n", "test3_id": 845}

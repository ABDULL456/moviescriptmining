EXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nA MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to maximum R.P.M. up the street. \nCUT TO: \n2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE \nThe sign reads \u0093KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS\u0094. \nCUT TO: \n3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nWith a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump. \nThe motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab. \nIn the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by. \nThe motorcycle bounces off a black \u009266 Chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world. \nThe rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose. \nThe motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block. \nCUT TO: \n4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY \nTwo rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each other\u0092s flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby. \nOLD WOMAN Oh my God! ... Why they doin\u0092 that? \nOLD MAN Who the hell knows.  What you have in your mouth? \nThe old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand. \nOLD MAN Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth out ... doctor said.  What you tryin\u0092 to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!! \nThe Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies. \nCUT TO: \n5. WASP NEST \nA thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other. \nCUT TO: \n6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY \nThe telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across the livingroom and answers the phone. \nMARIETTA Hello...  Who is this?... \nCUT TO: \n7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY \nA GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman - speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench. \nSAILOR (into phone) ...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk to Lula? \nCUT TO: \n6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY \nMARIETTA There\u0092s no way in hell you can speak to her and... \nCUT TO: \n7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY \nSAILOR (feeling a smile coming on) What?... \nCUT TO: \n6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY \nMARIETTA ...Yes you heard me...  Don\u0092t ever call back here again. \nMarietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Marietta\u0092s twenty-year old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs. \nThe electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her \u009280 Black Camaro out and away.  The garage door closes automatically. \nCUT TO: \n15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nLula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and disappears. \nCUT TO: \n16. INT. BEANY THORN\u0092S GARAGE - DAY \nLula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beany\u0092s \u009267 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Bird\u0092s front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY \nMarietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out. \nCUT TO: \n18. INT. \u0093SOUTHERN TIME\u0094 BAR - DAY \nMarietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER... \nMARIETTA Where\u0092s Johnnie?  He\u0092s not in his office. \nBARTENDER Haven\u0092t seen \u0092im yet today, Marietta. \nMARIETTA (slightly hysterical) Well I gotta find him - right this minute! \nCUT TO: \n19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY \nSailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing out a cloud of dust.  They\u0092re both smiling. \nLULA Hey baby... \nSAILOR Peanut... \nThey kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket. \nSAILOR Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks, baby...  Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom? \nLULA \u0092Bout fifty thousand times.  I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?...  I hear Powermad\u0092s at \u0093The Hurricane.\u0094 \nSAILOR (smiling) Stab it and steer. \nLula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust. \nCUT TO: \n20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY \nSailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the fan creak. \nLULA Did you ever think somethin\u0092 like about the wicked witch of the east comin\u0092 flyin\u0092 in?...  Did you ever think somethin\u0092 and then later think you\u0092ve said it out loud to someone? \nSAILOR I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The rest of you, too, of course.  But the way your head works is God\u0092s own private mystery.  What was it you was thinkin\u0092? \nLULA Well, I was thinkin\u0092 about smokin\u0092 actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole \u0092em from her beginnin\u0092 in about sixth grade.  When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I\u0092ve just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed?  They\u0092re longer. \nSAILOR I guess I started smokin\u0092 when I was about six...  My mama was already dead from lung cancer... \nLULA What brand\u0092d she smoke? \nSAILOR Camels, same as me...  Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness. \nLULA Gee, Sailor.  I\u0092m sorry, honey.  I never would have guessed it. \nSAILOR It\u0092s okay.  I hardly used to see them anyway.  I didn\u0092t have much parental guiding.  The public defender kept sayin\u0092 that at my parole hearin\u0092. He was a good ol\u0092 boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time. \nLULA I\u0092d stand by you, Sailor ... through anything. \nSAILOR Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man can\u0092t ask for more than that. \nLula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth. \nLULA You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest. \nSailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lula\u0092s breasts. \nSAILOR You\u0092re perfect for me, too. \nLULA You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies.  He had a long nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever tell you how he died? \nSAILOR In a fire, as I recall. \nLULA Started he couldn\u0092t remember things? Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin\u0092 me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin\u0092 the old paint off our house without usin\u0092 a mask...  But I don\u0092t know.  Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \n28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY \nLula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway from where he lays on the bed. \nLULA Sailor, you are somethin\u0092 else, honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I\u0092d be startin\u0092 to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it. \nSAILOR But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen. \nLULA That\u0092s true.  Uncle Pooch wasn\u0092t really an uncle.  He was a business partner of my daddy\u0092s?  And my mama never knew nothin\u0092 about me and him - that\u0092s for damn sure.  His real name was somethin\u0092 kind of European, like Pucinski.  But everyone just called him Pooch.  He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more\u0092n a little. \nSAILOR How\u0092d it happen, peanut?  He just pull out the old toad and let it croak? \nLula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while she teases her hair. \nLULA You\u0092re terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know? \nSAILOR I can\u0092t hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth. \nLula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink. \nLULA I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don\u0092t think I care for it. \nSAILOR Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed. \nLULA Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin\u0092 her hair dyed?  And I was alone in the house. \nCUT TO: \n29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nWe see what she talks about. \nLULA (voice-over) Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know?  Where I was makin\u0092 a jelly and banana sandwich?  I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin\u0092 that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter. \nCUT TO: \n30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY \nSAILOR Didn\u0092t he say somethin\u0092? \nLula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and throws it into the toilet. \nECU of cigarette in toilet. \nLULA Not really.  Least not so I recall now. \nLula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls down the hole. \nECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls. \nSAILOR So how\u0092d he finally nail you?  Right there in the kitchen? \nLULA No, he picked me up. \nCUT TO: \n31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAID\u0092S ROOM - DAY \nWe see what she talks about. \nLULA (voice-over) He was short but powerful.  With hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me into the maid\u0092s dayroom which nobody used.  We did it there on an old bed. \nCUT TO: \n32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY \nSAILOR \u0091We\u0092 did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didn\u0092t he force you? \nLULA Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle, you know?  I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there\u0092s all different kinds of rapes.  I didn\u0092t exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn\u0092t seem all that terrible.  It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there.  I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off.  Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin\u0092 my sandwich. \nSAILOR And you never told nobody about it? \nLULA Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after.  And he never did anything else to me.  I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry? (pause) \nCUT TO: \n33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY \nOne hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a \u009254 Ford Pick-Up and a \u009264 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and grinding metal. \nCUT TO: \n34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY \nLULA Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin\u0092 in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby...  That government of ours should be keepin\u0092 us separated from outer space... \nSAILOR Here she goes again... \nLULA Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin\u0092.  Seems to me the government could do somethin\u0092 about it.  One of these mornings the sun\u0092ll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray. \nLula strikes a match and lights another cigarette. \nSANTOS But where in the head?...  Not the chin, I hope. \nMARIETTA No...  In the brains...  What little I\u0092m sure he has. \nSANTOS You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun. \nMARIETTA Yes. \nSANTOS Through the forehead? \nMARIETTA Yes. \nSANTOS Wrong!  It\u0092s much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ...  Lots and lots of irreparable damage. \nMARIETTA See!  I knew you had it all under control. \nSANTOS Why didn\u0092t you send Johnnie Farragut? \nMARIETTA Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first... Lula can\u0092t ever stop talkin\u0092 \u0092bout that town. \nSANTOS On one condition... \nHe pauses and smiles strangely. \nSANTOS You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut. \nMARIETTA (whisper) Santos...  No...  Please, Santos... \nSANTOS You\u0092re not tellin\u0092 me that you\u0092re sweet on him? \nMARIETTA No...  But... \nSANTOS One day he\u0092s gonna find out what we\u0092re up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble. \nThey stare at each other for a moment. \nSANTOS I\u0092m gonna take your silence as a \u0093yes\u0094... \nMARIETTA Santos...  I can\u0092t... \nSANTOS Shhhh...  It\u0092s all right...  Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed. \nMARIETTA You fucker, don\u0092t you ever touch Lula -  You fucker, I\u0092ll kill you. \nSANTOS (laughing) Put your shoulders back. \nMARIETTA What? \nSANTOS Put your shoulders back, I said. \nMarietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of her. \nSANTOS You got nice tits. \nMARIETTA Someone\u0092s gonna see us. \nSANTOS (smiling as he starts to feel her breasts) That\u0092s just another part of the price to pay. \nMARIETTA Santos...  You kill that Sailor, otherwise he\u0092s gonna turn my baby against me. \nSantos lifts one hand up to Marietta\u0092s chin and raises her face up towards his. \nSANTOS Look at me...  There\u0092s no turning back on this...  I\u0092m gonna kill Sailor... That\u0092s for sure. \nCUT TO: \n36. INT. \u0093THE HURRICANE\u0094 - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT \nWe see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign. \nOne hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name \u0093Powermad\u0094 on the bass drum. \nThe BAND segues into \u0093Slaughter House\u0094 and it\u0092s a hot one.  Sailor grabs Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula. They thought they\u0092d seen everything. \nCU of Lula and Sailor - they\u0092re in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the man a fully extended \u0093Reno point\u0094... \nSAILOR Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl?  Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her? \nIDIOT PUNK Don\u0092t fuck with me, man.  You look like a clown in that stupid jacket. \nSAILOR This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it\u0092s a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom. \nIDIOT PUNK ...Asshole. \nSAILOR (as he moves toward the Idiot Punk) Come here. \nLULA Sailor, honey... \nThe Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back tears and holding his cheek. \nSAILOR (helping him up) I\u0092m sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl. \nIDIOT PUNK (to Lula) I\u0092m sorry. \nECU of doctor\u0092s nose and ears ... HAIR! \nLULA (voice-over) Afterwards...  Momma says... \nWe see Marietta standing next to the doctor. \nLULA (voice-over) ...I hope you appreciate my spendin\u0092 six hundred dollars, not countin\u0092 what it cost us to get here and back...  This man\u0092s the best damn abortionist in the South. \nCUT TO: \n39. INT. CAPE FEAR MOTEL - NIGHT \nSAILOR You tell the boy who knocked you up? \nLULA It was my cousin, Dell, done it?  His folks used to visit with us summers. \nSAILOR What happened to him? \nLULA Oh, nothin\u0092.  I never let on to mama about Dell bein\u0092 the one.  I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was?  I didn\u0092t tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn\u0092t see the point. Somethin\u0092 terrible happened to him, though.  Six months ago. \nSAILOR What\u0092s that, peanut? \nLULA Dell disappeared.  Dell was learnin\u0092 a hard lesson.  What I learned from observin\u0092 Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He\u0092d startin\u0092 behavin\u0092 weird?  Like comin\u0092 up to people every fifteen minutes and askin\u0092 how they were doin\u0092? \nCUT TO: \n40. EXT. CITY STREET - CHATTANOOGA - DAY \nDELL, wearing a soiled double-knit suit stops a LADY in the street, and smiling about the fact that earlier that morning he\u0092s placed a cockroach on his anus, he speaks to the woman. \nDELL How\u0092re ya doin\u0092? \nCUT TO: \n41. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT \nLULA And just seemin\u0092 real spacey and actin\u0092 funny. \nSAILOR Actin\u0092 funny how? \nLULA Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell\u0092s mama?  She found cockroaches in Dell\u0092s underwear. \nCUT TO: \n42. INT. AUNT ROOTIE\u0092S HOUSE \nCU of Aunt Rootie - unfolds a pair of dirty jockey shorts and several cockroaches fall out. \nCUT TO: \n43. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT \nLULA One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin\u0092 one big cockroach on his anus? \nSAILOR Hell, peanut... \nLULA One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.?  She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin\u0092 sandwiches in the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n44. AUNT ROOTIE\u0092S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nIn the dark kitchen, AUNT ROOTIE finds Dell making sandwiches - slicing them on the diagonal. \nAUNT ROOTIE What\u0092re ya doin\u0092? \nDELL Makin\u0092 my lunch!!! \nLULA (voice-over) Dell told her he was makin\u0092 his lunch and goin\u0092 to work.  He\u0092s a welder?  And she made him go back to bed. \nWe see Aunt Rootie cross the kitchen - take the knife away from Dell and lead him out of the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \n45. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT \nLULA Then he\u0092d carry on about the weather? Talk about how rainfall\u0092s controlled by aliens livin\u0092 on earth.

AUNT ROOTIE\u0092S HOUSE - DELL\u0092S ROOM - NIGHT \nDell, crying uncontrollably, is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts.  He has a long ruler stretched out in front of him which he\u0092s using to press down on the top of a lone black glove on the floor. \nLULA (voice-over) ...are followin\u0092 him around. \nSAILOR Prob\u0092ly the rain boys from Outer Space. \nCUT TO: \n47. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT \nLULA It ain\u0092t so funny now, though.  December before Christmas?  Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him.  He was missin\u0092 for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin\u0092 dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit. \nINT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - NIGHT \nSAILOR It\u0092s a prob\u0092lm I don\u0092t think\u0092s gonna go away too soon though...  Peanut, I\u0092m thinkin\u0092 of breakin\u0092 parole and takin\u0092 you out to sunny California. \nLULA Sailor! \nSAILOR You up for that? \nLULA I\u0092d got to the far end of the world for you, baby...  You know I would. \nSAILOR Those toenails dry yet?  We got some dancin\u0092 to do. \nWe drift down Lula\u0092s long white legs to her blood red toenails. \nCUT TO: \n54. INT. \u0093THE HURRICANE BAR\u0094 - NIGHT \nCU of Lula\u0092s dancing feet in black spiked-heel sandals exposing blurred blood red toenails.  Lula and Sailor are at it again - dancing as if plugged in to the main power plant. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n55. INT. BAR - BACK OF \u0093THE HURRICANE\u0094 - NIGHT \nDrenched in sweat, Sailor and Lula sit at a corner table chug-a-lugging \u0093Rolling Rock\u0094 during the band\u0092s break.  Lula notices a girl in the corner eye-balling Sailor.  She splits her attention between the girl and Sailor. \nLULA ...That\u0092s an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy. \nSAILOR Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez.  At that age you still got a lot of energy. \nLULA You still got plenty energy for me, baby. \nLula has had enough of the girl staring at Sailor. \nLULA Take a picture, bitch...  It\u0092ll last longer. \nGIRL Oh yeah? \nLULA I\u0092ll slap those eyes right outta your head. \nThe girl gets up in a huff and leaves. \nLULA Sorry, baby...  When\u0092s the first time you done it with a girl who wasn\u0092t hookin\u0092? \nSAILOR Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin\u0092 my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid\u0092s house whose parents were out of town.  A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me. CUT TO: \n56. INT. JUNIOR TRAIN\u0092S FRIEND\u0092S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAVANNAH \nWe see what he talks about. \nSAILOR (voice-over) She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma. \nCUT TO: \n57. INT. BAR - BACK OF \u0093THE HURRICANE\u0094 - NIGHT \nLULA What\u0092d you say to her? \nSAILOR Told her my name.  Then she said somethin\u0092 like, \u0091It\u0092s so noisy down here.  Why don\u0092t we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?\u0092 She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day. \nCUT TO: \n58. INT. JUNIOR TRAIN\u0092S FRIEND\u0092S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nWe see what he talks about. \nSAILOR (voice-over) When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind. \nCUT TO: \n59. INT. BAR - BACK OF \u0093THE HURRICANE\u0094 - NIGHT \nLULA Oh, baby.  What a bad boy you are! \nSAILOR (laughing) That\u0092s just what she said.  I had a boner with a capital \u0093O.\u0094  I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin\u0092 and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin\u0092 on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines.  She was a wild chick.  She was wearin\u0092 bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin\u0092 lacy black stripes down the sides.  You know, them kind that doesn\u0092t go all the way down your leg? \nLULA You mean like pedal pushers? \nSAILOR I guess. \nCUT TO: \n60. INT.

Lula strips off the dishwater grey bedspread and tosses it over by the bureau.  Sailor looks out the broken window. \nLULA I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads.  They don\u0092t hardly never get washed, and I don\u0092t like the idea of lyin\u0092 on other people\u0092s dirt. \nSAILOR Come look at this. \nLULA (going to the window) What\u0092s that, honey? \nSAILOR (thinking about death) There ain\u0092t no water in the swimmin\u0092 pool.  Just a dead tree fell in, prob\u0092ly from bein\u0092 struck by lightnin\u0092. \nLULA (thinking about granddad) It\u0092s huge.

Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream.  I kinda wish I didn\u0092t remember it.  Up at Pee Dee, I couldn\u0092t remember any of my dreams. \nLULA What was this one? \nSAILOR It wasn\u0092t no fun, Lula.  The wind was blowin\u0092 super-hard and I wasn\u0092t dressed warm.  Only instead of freezin\u0092, I was sweatin\u0092 strong. \nCUT TO: \n87. CU of eyes.

But it wasn\u0092t all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset.  My bein\u0092 there was upsettin\u0092 to you.  You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you\u0092d got married and your husband was comin\u0092 home any minute. \nCUT TO: \n87A. CU of eyes.  Black sweat is rolling down the forehead and over the eyes. \nSAILOR (voice-over) I tell you, Lula.  I was shakin\u0092 wet.

THUNDERBIRD \nLula and Sailor are motoring along. \nSAILOR Sweetheart, keep your panties up. We\u0092re in Jimmy Swaggart country. \nSailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He slows to pick him up. \nLULA Sure you wanna do this?  Might be a way they could track us. \nSAILOR He\u0092s just a regular guy\u0092t needs help, honey.  Look at him. \nThe HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway. \nROACH Thanks a lot.  I been standin\u0092 out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha!

Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old. \nROACH I\u0092m headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha! \nLULA (to Sailor) This guy\u0092s crazy. \nSAILOR Where you from, Roach? \nROACH If you mean where I was born, it was Belzoni, Missi\u0092ppi, ha-ha!  But I been brought up in Baton Rouge. \nLULA Why you goin\u0092 to Alaska?  And where\u0092d you get them puppies?  They look sick. \nRoach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick his dirty fingers. \nROACH I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The Call of the Wild.  I ain\u0092t never seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs at the pound.  Nobody wanted \u0092em, ha-ha!  Ever\u0092body here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  I\u0092m gonna feed these boys good so they\u0092ll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha! \nRoach pulls a piece of raw cow\u0092s liver out of one of his pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to the dogs. \nLULA (screeches as she sees this) Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now! \nSailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops. Lula opens her door and jumps out. \nLULA I\u0092m sorry, but I can\u0092t take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant! \nRoach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door. \nLULA I\u0092m truly sorry?  I\u0092m truly sorry, Roach.  But ain\u0092t gonna make it to Alaska?  Least not any part of the way with us.  You\u0092d best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die?  And, if you don\u0092t mind my sayin\u0092 so?  You could most certainly use some serious lookin\u0092 after yourself, startin\u0092 with a bath! \nLula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on. \nLULA Drive. \nSailor takes off. \nSAILOR You don\u0092t feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey? \nLULA I know you\u0092re thinkin\u0092 that I got more\u0092n some of my mama in me?

Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by the arm. \nLULA Come on. \nThey step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into \u0093the bird.\u0094  He holds his hand that way while he speaks... \nBARTENDER ZANZIBAR This is a friendly place, son.  You folks just relax and have a nice time. \nLULA (bound and determined not to be intimidated) You got yourself a deal. \nBARTENDER (to Sailor) That\u0092s a real jacket...  By that, I mean a real stupid jacket. \nSAILOR This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom. \nBARTENDER Fuckin\u0092 honky cracker mumbo jumbo. \nThe bartender moves on down the bar.

She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more. Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender. \nSAILOR I tend to like \u0092em with a little more meat on the bones.  Face ain\u0092t bad, though. \nLula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle. \nSAILOR What\u0092s wrong, sweetheart?

See if we can get some work? \nSAILOR Not in Houston.  We\u0092d be better off in some place more out of the way. \nLULA You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest. \nSAILOR That\u0092d be good, Lula. \nSailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down.  Lula slides behind the wheel and lights up a More.

He seems to know exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta. \nMARIETTA (horrified whisper) Santos...  Where\u0092s J-J-Johnnie? \nSANTOS Shhhhhh... (to the manager and desk clerk) Thank you, gentlemen...  I\u0092ll look after her now... \nThe Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands. \nMARIETTA Santos...

INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT \nJohnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front of his. \nJUANA Johnnie, you take a good look at me, baby, cause you gonna haf\u0092ta watch close to know when we do it to ya...

Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos. \nLula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8. \nSAILOR Lula, you there? \nLULA Yeah, I\u0092m here. \nSAILOR You upset with me? \nLULA No, Sailor darlin\u0092.  Just shockin\u0092 sometimes when things aren\u0092t the way you thought they were...  I been carryin\u0092 a secret too... \nCUT TO: \n121. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe livingroom is on fire. \nThe livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the smoke-filled hallway to her mother\u0092s bedroom. \nThe livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mother\u0092s bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window. Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel. \nLULA (voice-over) That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin\u0092...  I saw mama up in her room with Santos... \nCUT TO: \n122. INT.

(after a pause - she smiles) So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined. \nSAILOR They have, sugar. \nLULA I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together. \nSAILOR It\u0092s a comfortin\u0092 idea. \nLULA Well, we\u0092re really out in the middle of it now, ain\u0092t we? \nSAILOR There\u0092s worse places, honey. \nLULA If you say so. \nSAILOR Trust me on it. \nLULA (turns to him) I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I ain\u0092t never trusted nobody before. \nSAILOR (after a moment) We\u0092ll be al\u0092right, peanut, long as we\u0092ve got room to move. \nLULA (looking into the highway) What\u0092s that? \nSAILOR I don\u0092t know...  Looks like clothes. \nSailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each other - they\u0092ve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an overturned car. \nLULA Oh God, Sailor. \nSAILOR One bad car accident... \nLULA SAILOR!!! \nComing out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - blood draining out of several deep wounds. \nLULA Sailor, what are we gonna do? \nSAILOR I don\u0092t know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole. \nThey get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming. \nGIRL (completely gone in shock) I\u0092ve got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and I can\u0092t find it... My mother\u0092s going to kill me.  It\u0092s got all my cards in it...  It was in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone. MY PURSE IS GONE!!!

(to Girl) Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta come with us, honey. \nSailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girl\u0092s arm. \nGIRL OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE... ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn sticky stuff in my hair... \nShe keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head. \nGIRL Gotta find my wallet. (to Sailor) Don\u0092t you say one word of this to my mother.  God, she\u0092s gonna kill me. \nThe girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and Lula each take an arm and try to help her. \nGIRL WHERE\u0092S MY HAIRBRUSH?... \nSAILOR Anything I can do for you? \nLULA No, I don\u0092t think so, Sail.  I just need to lie down. \nLula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed. \nLULA Sailor?  You know what? \nSAILOR I know you ain\u0092t particularly pleased bein\u0092 here. \nLULA Not that.  Look at what I wrote down cause I can\u0092t say it. \nLula hands Sailor a note which reads \u0093I\u0092m pregnant.\u0094  Sailor looks into her eyes. \nSAILOR It\u0092s okay by me, peanut. \nLULA Well, nothin\u0092 personal, but I ain\u0092t sure it\u0092s okay by me. \nSailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray. \nLULA Really, Sailor, it ain\u0092t nothin\u0092 against you.  I love you. \nSAILOR Love you, too. \nLULA I know.  Just I\u0092m sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin\u0092, and this don\u0092t help soothe me. \nSAILOR I know this ain\u0092t easy, Lula, but I ain\u0092t gonna let things get no worse, I promise. \nCU of Lula setting fire to the pregnant note in the ashtray. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n131. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULA\u0092S ROOM - DAY \nCU of flies on vomit stain. \nThere is a knock on the door which wakes Lula from her nap.  She opens the door.  Bobby Peru stands outside. \nBOBBY Hey, pretty woman...  Sailor here? \nLULA No, he\u0092s out changin\u0092 the oil in the car. \nBOBBY Man, I gotta take a piss bad...

PERDITA DURANGO\u0092S HOUSE - DAY \nSailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door. Flies are buzzing all around.

I figured I\u0092d see you sometime... \nSAILOR Hopin\u0092 you could tell me if there\u0092s a contract out on me.  I really need to know. \nPERDITA By who? \nSAILOR I think Santos or Marietta Fortune. \nPERDITA Heard you was goin\u0092 out with that bitch\u0092s daughter. \nSAILOR You heard right. \nPERDITA You really are one dumb asshole. \nSAILOR Life is unpredictable. \nPERDITA Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy? (Sailor doesn\u0092t answer - Perdita smiles) Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin\u0092 the shit himself?... (Sailor doesn\u0092t answer) Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to? \nSAILOR I didn\u0092t see nothin\u0092... \nPERDITA Yeah...  But I did...  And I told you all about it... \nSAILOR Is there a contract?...  We made a deal once that we\u0092d tip each other off if we ever heard. \nPERDITA I know...

ROSARITA\u0092S - DAY \nThey enter a long, dark room where a DOZEN MEN, most of them wearing cowboy hats, sit on stools at a bar drinking beer out of frosted mugs. \nBOBBY No hard liquor here.  Just beer. \nThey claim two stools. \nBOBBY Couple Stars, Jimmy. \nThe BARTENDER brings over two bottle and two mugs - then walks back to the other end of the bar. \nSAILOR Thought you said this was a private club.  How come I\u0092m allowed in without bein\u0092 a member? \nBOBBY You black? \nSAILOR No. \nBOBBY You an indian? \nSAILOR No. \nBOBBY Then you\u0092re a member...  Three or four millionaires in here right now. \nSAILOR (looking around) They look like a bunch of good ol\u0092 boys to me.  I guess it\u0092s oil money, huh? \nBOBBY Oil, gas, cattle, farmin\u0092.  Ain\u0092t nobody shows off around here.  Iguana County\u0092s one of the richest in Texas. \nSAILOR Wouldn\u0092ta guessed it, that\u0092s sure. \nBOBBY Ready for another? \nSAILOR Why not? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nBobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor. \nBOBBY Q-7, three times.  Pee Wee King\u0092s \u0093Waltz of Regret,\u0094 my favorite tune. \nPee Wee\u0092s steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes around Sailor\u0092s head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind the bar. \nBOBBY I been studyin\u0092 a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it. \nSAILOR What\u0092s that? \nBOBBY Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe.  Need me a good boy for back-up.  Even split.  You interested? \nSailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes. \nSAILOR No...  I don\u0092t think so, man. \nBOBBY Be easy, Sailor.  There\u0092s two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other\u0092n covered... You ain\u0092t plannin\u0092 on raisin\u0092 a fam\u0092ly in Big Tuna, are ya? \nSAILOR (on the alert) Whattaya mean family? \nBOBBY (smiling) Well...  I mean like Lula bein\u0092 in a family way. \nSAILOR (a tinge of jealousy/fear) Lula tell you she\u0092s pregnant? \nBobby grins, showing those three brown teeth. \nBOBBY Couple grand or more\u0092d give you two a leg up.  Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans.  I got it figured good, Sailor. \nSAILOR When did you talk to Lula? \nBOBBY Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out. \nSAILOR She really say she was pregnant? \nBOBBY (smiles - puts a hand on Sailor\u0092s shoulder) Just took a guess is all...  You in or out on this deal? \nSAILOR (looking at Bobby\u0092s hand on his shoulder) I ain\u0092t fuckin\u0092 sure, Bobby. \nBOBBY Don\u0092t think about it too long. (nods toward Sailor\u0092s mug) You had enough? \nSAILOR (finishing his beer) Have now. \nBOBBY Come on outside, I got somethin\u0092 to show ya. \n136A. EXT. ROARITA\u0092S - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING \nBobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket. \nBOBBY That\u0092s a double-barreled, sawed-off, Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape. Next to it\u0092s a cold Smith and Wesson .32 handgun with a six inch barrel. These\u0092ll do \u0092er...  Loosen up that five grand...  Two and a half for you and the little lady... \nBobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit. \nBOBBY How much money you have between the two a\u0092ya right now?... \nLula puffs hard on her cigarette. \nLULA I sure enjoy smokin\u0092, Sailor.  I hate that it\u0092s bad for you. \nSailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his head. \nLULA That man\u0092s a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you\u0092ll regret it.  If you live to. \nS\t\t\t\tAILOR Thanks, darlin\u0092, I know you got my best interest in mind, and I \u0092preciate it sincerely.  I love you, but I gotta sleep now. \nLula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on the dresser top. \nLULA This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top. \nLula turns over, away from Sailor. \nLULA (softly) I wish you really, truly loved me... I wish you\u0092d sing me \u0093Love Me Tender\u0094 ...  I wish I was somewhere over that rainbow...  Shit.  Shit, shit, shit. \nCU of Sailor\u0092s eyes - he remembers. \nCUT TO: \n138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nSailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta stands at the top - watching. \nBOB RAY Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I got somethin\u0092 for ya. \nAs Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailor\u0092s ear. \nBOB RAY Shit, man...  Marietta says you been tryin\u0092 to fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes...  You crazy fuckin\u0092 bad boy tryin\u0092 to fuck your girl\u0092s mama...  How do you think that cute little cunt Lula would feel about that?  Hey, take a look at this... (shows Sailor one thousand dollars in cash) Marietta just gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said Lula was mine to fuck all the way into next Sunday. \nBob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailor\u0092s fist is already halfway through Bob Ray\u0092s brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone. Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and doesn\u0092t stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning with hate. \nCUT TO: \n139. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULA\u0092S ROOM - NIGHT \nSailor is dripping with sweat.  His teeth are clenched tight and his fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed apart. \nCUT TO: \n140. INT. PERDITA DURANGO\u0092S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams around the livingroom. \nPERDITA Nice of you to drop by. \nBOBBY Told ya I would.  You still riled? \nPERDITA (laughs) You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass? \nBobby keeps circling. \nBOBBY Ain\u0092t never had no girl pull a blade on me. \nPERDITA Wish I\u0092d fuckin\u0092 cut you up good. \nBOBBY You heard from Reggie? \nPERDITA Juana called.  They\u0092re stayin\u0092 another week. \nBobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall. \nBOBBY Stayin\u0092 a few extra days in the big N.O., huh?  This you? \nPerdita turns her head and looks, then turns back. \nPERDITA Yes. \nWe see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie. \nBOBBY Don\u0092t look like you. \nBobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perdita\u0092s from behind. \nBOBBY The cobra\u0092s waitin\u0092 to strike, chica. \nPERDITA That guy Sailor came around this afternoon...  Asked me if there was a contract out on \u0092im. \nBOBBY (laughs out loud) No shit?!?!  You know him? \nPERDITA Used to. \nBOBBY What\u0092d you say? \nPERDITA No, of course. \nBobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands tails up in his hand.  He pockets it. \nBOBBY That\u0092s right...  Could have a bad accident, though ... before ... durin\u0092 ... or after a hold-up... \nPERDITA What\u0092s gonna happen when he sees me drivin\u0092 the car tomorrow? \n146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nThe two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock. \nSAILOR BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!! \nCUT TO: \n147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY \nReacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels out, knocking the deputy down. \nCUT TO: \n148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY \nSailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around and points it at Sailor. \nBOBBY You\u0092re next, fucker. \nThe second old man is reaching under the counter. \nSailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol. It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door. \n148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY \nThe deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobby\u0092s thigh and his second into Bobby\u0092s left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobby\u0092s right hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store. \nSailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy orders him to stand up. \nCUT TO: \n149. INT. IGUANA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY \nLula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses her. \nMARIETTA Oh baby, I was beginnin\u0092 to think I was never gonna see you again. \nTears are pouring down Marietta\u0092s cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos. \nMARIETTA You\u0092re comin\u0092 home, precious.  Santos\u0092 gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport. \nLULA Mama, Sailor\u0092s in deep trouble here. I just can\u0092t leave him. \nMarietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lula\u0092s eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are pale. \nMARIETTA Oh, yes, you can. \nSantos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble. \nSANTOS Your mama\u0092s been real worried \u0092bout you, honey.  Me too...  Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too? \nSantos\u0092 arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, orange, and silver. \nCUT TO: \n150. INT. WALLS UNIT - DAY \nSailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula. \nLULA (voice-over) \nDearest Sailor Darling, \nThe first thing you\u0092ll want to know is I\u0092m keeping the baby. Mama wasn\u0092t for it in the beginning but I think she\u0092s looking forward to it.  I\u0092m gonna name it Pace no matter if it\u0092s a boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, don\u0092t it?  It\u0092s kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old when you get out. \nI feel like I\u0092m kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, it\u0092ll be over and I\u0092ll have a son or daughter to show for it.  Our child!! \nI love you Sailor.  I don\u0092t know how much or what it means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know you\u0092re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. \nMama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My daddy left a lot of money somehow and they\u0092re spending it like there is no tomorrow.  I\u0092m going to move out as soon as I can. \nMama and Santos said because of the baby they\u0092re lookin\u0092 at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. \nJohnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you. \nTime don\u0092t really fly honey does it? \nLove, your Lula \nP.S. I miss dancing... \nCUT TO: \n151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY \nLula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor. \nSAILOR (voice-over) \nDear Lula, \nIt is fine with me about the baby as you already know. And Pace being your family name and all is just right. What about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think? \n", "test1_input": "Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he looks the men over quickly. \nJOHNNIE (cautiously) Alright...  By all means.  Make yourselves at home. \nDROP SHADOW (as he sits down) Muchas gracias. \nREGGIE My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But please do call me Reggie.  This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow.  He is always with me. \nJohnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes. \nJOHNNIE Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya. \nReggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their meal before saying anything more. \nREGGIE You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut? \nJOHNNIE Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte, North Carolina.  Here on business. \nReggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth. \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras. \nREGGIE Do you know Honduras, Johnny? \nJOHNNIE Only that it\u0092s supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year. \nREGGIE Yes, that\u0092s so.  But there is not much to destroy. \nDROP SHADOW No big buildings like in New Orleans. \nJOHNNIE Whattaya do there? \nREGGIE (laughs) Oh, many things... \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula\u0092s got an appliance shop. \nREGGIE But I am also with the government. \nJohnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich. \nJOHNNIE In what capacity? \nREGGIE In many capacities. \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service. \nReggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands a card to Johnnie. \nJOHNNIE (reading aloud) General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666. \nREGGIE He is my sponsor.  The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras. \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives. \nJohnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish. \nREGGIE That is my permiso. \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula\u0092s permit to kill. \nREGGIE Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. (laughs) \nJOHNNIE Of course. \nJohnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie. \nDROP SHADOW Mr. San Pedro Sula\u0092s authorized to carry a .45. \nREGGIE United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase. \nReggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on the floor beneath his chair. \nJOHNNIE Why are you in New Orleans?  If you don\u0092t mind my askin\u0092. \nREGGIE Certainly not.  We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA. \nDROP SHADOW He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing. \nREGGIE We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen. \nJohnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave. \nJOHNNIE (extending his hand) It\u0092s been a real pleasure.  I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go. \nReggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnie\u0092s hand. \nREGGIE The same to you.  If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us.  The Hondurans are great friends of the American people.  But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first? \nJOHNNIE I couldn\u0092t say, which one? \nReggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line. \nDROP SHADOW (grinning) Who cares? \n", "test1_true": "79.

Oh, Sailor you\u0092re so aware of what goes on with me?  I mean, you pay attention.  And I swear, you got the sweetest cock.

Should I know about you for anythin\u0092 in particular? \nGEORGE Was in all the papers three years ago. I\u0092m seventy-six, was only seventy- three then.  Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted \u0092em killed. \nLULA Why were you killin\u0092 pigeons, Mr. Kovich?  Were you in the extermination business? \nGEORGE No, ma\u0092am.  I was a housepainter, in the union forty-one years.  I\u0092m retired now, livin\u0092 with my sister, Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  He\u0092s dead now, so it\u0092s just me and Ida.  I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW was doin\u0092 them a service, and they charged me with endangerin\u0092 the public. \nLULA What\u0092s wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich? \nGEORGE They\u0092re useless pests.

He owned a bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street. Earl\u0092s roof was a favorite spot for pigeons.  They lit there day and night. I wanted to toss a grenade up there. \nSAILOR If your neighbors didn\u0092t mind, how\u0092d you get put out of business? \nGEORGE Woman drivin\u0092 down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle.  She called the police and they came over and arrested me.  Thought I was a sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that one.  Cops didn\u0092t understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property.  I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger.  I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody\u0092s cat would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats myself.  So I used the .22 because it didn\u0092t make much noise and the ammo was cheap. \nSAILOR What happened on the charges? \nGEORGE Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place.  You seen it.  Plain filth. \nKovich stands up and puts some money on the counter. \nGEORGE It\u0092s a serious situation.  Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people to remember me and what I\u0092ve done and pick up where I left off.  Somebody had to make a move.

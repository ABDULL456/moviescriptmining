Featuring the police. The sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again. 
Their point of view. Gandhi and the miners coming on once more, chanting forcefully. "One King! One Law! One King! One Law!" 
SERGEANT What the hell are we supposed to do now? 
CIVILIAN (watching the procession narrowly) Let them march... In our own sweet time, in our own sweet way -- we'll get them. 
SMALL CHURCH - SOUTH AFRICA - INTERIOR - DAY 
We are close on Charlie Andrews. 
CHARLIE Some of you may be rejoicing that Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into prison. 
The congregation is listening to him stiffly, unsympathetically, and there is more than one murmur of assent at his words. The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing. 
CHARLIE But I would ask you -- assembled here in this house of God -- to recognize that we are witnessing something new, something so unexpected, so unusual that it is not surprising the Government is at a loss. What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do is ask questions about ourselves. 
A few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort their families from the church. Charlie struggles on. 
CHARLIE As Christians, those are difficult questions to answer. How do we treat men who defy an unjust law -- men who will not fight, but will not comply? 
More of the congregation rise and march from the church... though a few pointedly do not. 
PRISON YARD - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Small, packed. Gandhi is threading his way in a line for soup. But it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in the line. 
As Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them. He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage on his head. When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi -- 
GANDHI They're sparing no one, I see. 
KHAN No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press. 
GANDHI So did I. 
He takes his soup from Khan. 
KHAN (acidly) Don't worry about the meat -- it's Hindu (referring to the soup) -- there's not a trace. 
Gandhi smiles, but they turn as the gate opens and a paddy wagon is backed into the press of prisoners. Khan shakes his head. 
KHAN I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women? 
GANDHI My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others. 
KHAN (angrily) The fools! (He spills some soup.) Sorry... 
GANDHI It's split the Government. 
KHAN Well, that's one victory. 
Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, the defiant, determined faces. 
GANDHI If we hold firm, it won't be the last. 
KHAN Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think -- 
He is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four men) pushing their way through the prisoners. 
PRISON OFFICER Gandhi! I want Gandhi! Which sammy is it? 
The prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who Gandhi is. The prison officer's eyes fall on him. 
CITY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - DAY 
A side street, but active. Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being marched down the pavement before two guards. The prison officer strides in front of them. People in the street stop and turn, staring. That part of Gandhi that is still the dandy is discomfited, but there is a growing part of him that defies appearances. 
Featuring a doorway. It is the side door of a large imposing building. The prison officer leads his little procession toward it. He knocks and the door opens. The tall civil servant has been waiting for them. The prison officer reaches forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles. 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING - INTERIOR - DAY 
The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that is at right angles to them (i.e. facing the front of the building). People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever. 
The grand staircase. The tall civil servant turns and starts up the staircase. Gandhi is even more exposed to everyone's surveillance on the wide, white expanse of the stairway. He hesitates, looking around in discomfort, then follows the tall civil servant on toward the large, white doors at the top of the staircase. 
SMUTS'S ANTEROOM - INTERIOR - DAY 
The tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates that Gandhi enter. Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock once on the inner doors. Then he pushes them open and gestures Gandhi in. 
SMUTS'S OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY 
We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk. 
SMUTS Ah, Mr. Gandhi. I thought we might have a little talk. 
He nods to the tall civil servant, who bows and closes the door. Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet. 
SMUTS Will you have a glass of sherry? 
GANDHI Thank you. No. 
Smuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal. 
SMUTS Perhaps some tea? 
GANDHI (a shake of the head) I dined at the prison. 
SMUTS Ahh. 
He appraises Gandhi, measuring the irony of his words, his determination. Then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity he replaces the stopper on the sherry, turns and gestures Gandhi on into the room. 
SMUTS Please -- please do come and sit down. It's prison I wanted to talk to you about. 
He has indicated a chair near his desk, but as Gandhi goes forward he pauses by a spread of papers from England on a long table near the middle of the room. We see one headline in close shot: "Thousands Imprisoned in South Africa/Mines Close. Crops Unharvested," a subhead, "Gandhi Leads Non- Violent Campaign." He looks at Smuts. Smuts smiles, a passing nod at the papers. 
SMUTS Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to. 
GANDHI (a beat) Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done. 
Smuts smiles. 
SMUTS Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple. 
GANDHI Somehow I expected not. 
A wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has directed him to. Smuts measures him again, not absolutely certain how to deal with him. A pause, and he affects to take Gandhi's irony at face value.

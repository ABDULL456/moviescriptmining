(JABBERING) The smoke. Look for the smoke -- 
SHARP CLAWS Suddenly RIP across Priest's back! It's the Lead Vampire, back for more. Claws digging into flesh. Priest wrenches around and the two go at it. A fierce, feral battle. The Vampire's fangs chattering inches from his neck. Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies, killing them instantly. 
THE VAMPIRE Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall, flying in after him. We hear the sounds of a BATTLE ROYALE from inside. WHUMPI WHUMPI WHUMP! The walls buckle outward, sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed. Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly...,s â g. Hicks takes a step towards the crypt. Gun leveled. But -- 
PRIEST Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in his hand dangling by its hair. He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - LATER 
A giant PYRE lights up the night, fed with the bodies of both Familiars and Vampires, Priest and Hicks silhouetted against the flames. The two are silent, grimly going about their task -- It's obvious the skirmish has affected Hicks. Priest notices. 
PRIEST How's your arm? 
HICKS Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that deep. (fingering the bandage) Don't know what got into those Familiars to attack like that. They're usually harmless. Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand, tucks it in his waistband. 
PRIEST Usually. A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension hanging between them. Then - 
HICKS You did this on purpose, didn't you? You knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown. You wanted this to happen. 
PRIEST You don't have the stomach for it --head back to Haibridge right now. Hicks glares at Priest. 
HICKS The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers two years. Even fought in the Boondock Uprising...I saw some crazy things. 
HORRIBLE THINGS 
(SOFTER) I just ain't never seen anything like this. 
PRIEST Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man. They come at'you like an animal. Tooth for tooth. 
.(MORE) 
'PRIEST (CON'Y'' D) Claw for claw -- Blood, skin, bones. 6 They take all of it. 
(BEAT) If you let `em. Hicks studies Priest, in the firelight he looks tired. Old even. 
HICKS it comes easy to you... don't it? 
PRIEST What? 
HICKS Killin'. 
PRIEST it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do with it. He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies. Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down. 
PRIEST (CONT' D) I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I know I've done more than my share -- Whatever they do to me I have it coming. 
HICKS 
(REALIZING) You think they took her because of you... don't you? Priest stands. Cracks his neck. 
PRIEST Give me your gun. 
HICKS What? 
PRIEST Give me your gun.

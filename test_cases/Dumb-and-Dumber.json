Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio. \nHARRY Where'd you get those? \nLLOYD Bought 'em when we filled up. \nHARRY Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember? \nLLOYD This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style. \nHARRY Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks? \nLLOYD I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C. \nHARRY You mean the blind kid? \nLLOYD That's right. \nLloyd looks out the window guiltily. \nHARRY What did you sell him, Lloyd? \nLLOYD Just some odds and ends. \nHARRY Specifically? \nLLOYD Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to? \nHARRY But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head. \nLLOYD Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nAt the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the ead bird up, but it flops into his lap. \nBILLY Fly! \nJoe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door. It reads: TO ALL OUR \nLOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE - LLOYD AND HARRY. \nPULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay. \nMENTAL Those bastards. They're rubbing it right in our faces. \nJ.P. SHAY Shit! Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we don't get that briefcase back. MENTAL Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And I'll   tell you something else. They ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either. I'll   make sure of that. \nMental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on them. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nA pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs. Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the air. \nBILLY Come on, boy, fly! \nPlop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS OUT: \nBILLY (CONT'D) Excuse me, mister. Is there something wrong with my bird? \nMental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can. \nMENTAL Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew south for the winter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON \nHarry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out before him. \nHARRY How far have we gone? \nLLOYD According to this map, about an inch and a half. \nHARRY Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money. LLOYD Relax. We have more than enough. \nHARRY I believe you're wrong, Lloyd. \nLLOYD And I believe I'm right, Harry. \n", "test1_true": "LLOYD How much you wanna bet? \nHARRY I don't bet. \nLloyd looks at his friend, incredulous. \nLLOYD What do you mean you don't bet? \nHARRY I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will. \nLLOYD Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out. \nHARRY There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do it. \nLLOYD I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose. \nHARRY You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble. \nLLOYD Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out. \nHARRY Sorry, pal, no way. \nLLOYD Make it ten-to-one. Harry sticks out his hand. \nHARRY You got yourself a bet, sucker! \nAs Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE. Harry immediately realizes he's been had. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRUCK STOP CAF\u00c9 - AFTERNOON \nThe Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor- trailer trucks. \nINT. TRUCK STOP CAF\u00c9 \nLloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables of tough-looking TRUCKERS. Harry oesn't look happy. A middle- aged, no-nonsense WAITRESS approaches their table with a couple of burgers and drinks. She puts them down in front of the boys and starts to walk away. \nLLOYD (to Waitress) \nUH, EXCUSE ME... \nThe Waitress reluctantly returns to the table. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) What's the soup du jour? \nWAITRESS It's the soup-of-the-day. \nLLOYD Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl. \nWAITRESS (sarcastic) Anything else before I leave the area? \nHARRY Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon? \nThe Waitress SIGHS and picks up the milk. Then she BLOWS INTO THE STRAW, MIXING THE DRINK. \nWAITRESS There. Now you don't need one. \nThe guys watch her stomp away. \nLLOYD \nFEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID- \nback country-folk, don't it, Harry? \nHarry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put it in the ashtray, he accidentally \nKNOCKS OVER THE SALT SHAKER. \nLLOYD Uh-oh... \nHARRY What's the matter? \nLLOYD You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder. \nHARRY What for? \nLLOYD Because that's good luck. \nHarry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it over his shoulder. Suddenly they hear a \nYELP. \nMALE VOICE (o.s.) What the fuck?! \n", "test1_id": 1980, "test2_input": "INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nThe room has a dirt floor. There's a stone WELL in the middle. We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the well. Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole. \nANDRE How you doing today, Melvin? \nAndre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the well. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate. \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nLloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd Rundgren's \"Too Far Gone\" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: \nA new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on Harry's lap. \nAnother sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window and his head is on Harry's lap. \nThe next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out. \nFinally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD, GAS NEXT EXIT. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING \nThe Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a caf\u00e9. Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door. \nLloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him with his foot. \nHARRY Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump. \nLloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet. \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nHarry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up. \nEXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room. When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock. \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nHarry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out. This seems to wake Harry up. \nThe Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods to the skis on her   roof-rack. \nHARRY Skis, huh? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY That's right. \nHARRY Great. \nShe continues to pump gas. \nHARRY (CONT'D) They yours? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Uh-huh.. \nHARRY Both of 'em? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Um, yeah. \nHARRY (impressed) Cool. \nTHE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS \nlike a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere. \nHarry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself. \nINT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM \nLloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, \nA.M. SHARP. \nHe frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch. \nCLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8. \n", "test2_true": "Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF. \nAll of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS. \nHIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass. \nSEA BASS Well, well, well, if it ain't my old friend. (checks watch) And right on time... \nAs Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nThe Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side- view mirror. \nHARRY (re: suitcases in back seat) That's a lot of luggage for a little vacation. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've got to get away from my boyfriend. \nHe's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid accident-prone guys. \nJust then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS \nHIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. \nHARRY (holding out mirror) Here, this is a little loose. \nShe throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a cigarette. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Allow me... \nHe pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish. The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.) \nHARRY (CONT'D) Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something. \nShe looks him over and smiles. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Why not? You seem pretty harmless. I'll give you my number. Just let me find a pen. \nAs she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE! He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe, but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still searching for a pen. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) I know I have one here somewhere... \nHarry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames. This only helps to fan them. \nHARRY (urgently) Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Are you sure you won't forget? \nHARRY (desperate) Positive please hurry. \nHe begins hopping around violently. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Is something wrong? \nHarry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) Okay, my number is 652-2553. (beat) Oh, wait a second, that's my old number. It's so funny how your mind god sakes, give me the damn number! \nShe's taken aback by this outburst. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy you can just forget it! \nShe throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY. \nINT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM \nSea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyd's neck as he slides him up the wall of the toilet stall. \nSEA BASS First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm gonna kill you. Any last request? \nLLOYD Um, yeah could you do it the other way around? \nSea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a green color to Lloyd's face. \nON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the toilet, \nEXTINGUISHING THE FIRE. \nHarry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND \nSEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE. \nHarry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in. Then he lets out an admonishing \n", "test2_id": 1981, "test3_input": "Helen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Feeling any better, honey? \nMary can't take her eyes from the window. \nMARY Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who... (fighting back tears) It's all my fault. I should've been there. \nHELEN Bullshit. You can't blame yourself for this. If you'd been there they would've taken you, too. \nHelen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit. \nMARY Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over \nwith. \nHELEN Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done. You've got to stop torturing yourself. \nMARY What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine? \nHELEN That's exactly what you should do. Get the hell out more, go skiing, socialize. Don't you see, honey? We can't let on that anything is wrong. If the press or authorities get wind of this, the kidnappers might panic.

Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely. \nINT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies. Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view. \nHARRY Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming. \nLLOYD It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time. \nHARRY And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money. \nHarry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty puff, and \nEXHALES. \nHARRY (CONT'D) You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today. \nHe blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony. \nLLOYD What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right? \nHARRY Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards? \nLLOYD Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry. \nHARRY Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them. \nLloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE. \nLLOYD Where'd this come from? \nHARRY (sheepishly) I bought it. \nLLOYD What for? \nHARRY I like the feel of it against my skin... (defensive) ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it. \nLloyd inspects it more closely. \nLLOYD Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL? \nHARRY Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door. \nLLOYD Enter, parlez vous! \nThe Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm. \nBARNARD I brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen. Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested. \nLloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns. \nLLOYD All out of Boone's Farm, huh? BARNARD You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon. \nLLOYD Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh? \nLloyd smiles and over tips him. \n", "test3_true": "He puts the tray down, hands Lloyd the newspaper, and heads for the door. \nLLOYD Oh, one more thing: You can     dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's     face it, Barney, we're all from the     same mold. (winks) We just have a little more     dough than you right now. \nBarnard smiles and EXITS. Harry comes back in the room. He picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger, sending out a resonant RING. \nHARRY Cocktail hour has commenced! \nHe starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Hey, later on what do you say we...? \nHe notices that Lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something he's found in the paper. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Lloyd... you okay? \nLLOYD (dumbstruck) Harry, it's her. \nHARRY Who? \nLLOYD Mary with the briefcase. This is her... \nHe shoves the newspaper at Harry. \nCLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath this is a photograph of Mary with her parents. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Mary Swanson... \nHARRY Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball... \nRoy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman\" plays over a... \nMONTAGE OF HARRY AND LLOYD'S GLAMOUR MAKE-OVER: \n-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed. \n-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both guys' hair in curlers. \n-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor. Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck \nas if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing. \n-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to the floor to reveal a PILE OF \nNOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS. \n-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric sander. \n-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles. \n-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back. \n-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed, but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in. \n-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves. \n-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up. \nPAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND LLOYD. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT \nThrongs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange. (THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred dollars. \nLLOYD Thanks for the lift, Barney. \nINT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY \nNicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them the once over. \nANDRE Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner. \nHarry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels \noff TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre. \nLLOYD This should cover a couple plates. \nHARRY I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds? \nLloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou. LLOYD Put us down for four plates, my good man. \nThey ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face. \n", "test3_id": 1982}

{"train": "FADE IN: \nEXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING \nA PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate. \nA black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past, SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all about. \nFinally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit. \nLLOYD Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit lost. \nYOUNG WOMAN (heavy European accent) Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge. \nLloyd checks out her body. \nLLOYD I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey? \nYOUNG WOMAN (unimpressed) Austria. \nLLOYD Austria? You're kidding. (mock-Australian accent) Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie. \nThe Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) (to self) Guess I won't be going Down Under tonight... \nHe SIGHS and zips the window back up. \nINT. LIMO \nLloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER! \nThe dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE: \nDISPATCHER (v.o.) Carr 22, come in, car 22... \nLloyd grabs his CB mike. \nLLOYD This is 22. \nDISPATCHER 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd? You're running late on the East Side pick-up. \nLLOYD Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my way. \nDISPATCHER (v.o.) Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY This building is white with black spots on it, like a DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside. \nThe vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it. \nHARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of DOGS pile out. \nHARRY Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies... \nThe door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR. PALMER, sticks his head out. \nPALMER Hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes? \nHARRY The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell. \nPALMER Just get them in here now! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour. \nPalmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits them on a wall. \nHARRY You kids stay right here... \nAs he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it. \nHARRY (CONT'D) (at truck) Hey, wait a minute! \nHarry chases after the vehicle. \nCUT TO: EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY \nLloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the front oor and RINGS THE BELL. \nThe double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when he lays eyes on her. \nMARY Hello. (beat) I'll be just a minute... \nAs Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind his ears... \nCUT TO: \nMary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are focused straight ahead. \nShe passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her. \nARMANI SUIT She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator. You make the pick-up. \nPLAID SPORTCOAT Piece of cake. \nEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport window and SEES MARY \nWALKING ALONG. \nWhen she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too. She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He turns to see a car irectly behind him. \nLLOYD (to car's driver) Drive around me, you pinhead! \nWhen he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION. \nHe pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim. \nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL \nThe Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at each other, dumbstruck. \nINT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE \nLloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion of numbers. \nLLOYD Damn! \nQUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away. \nEXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY \nLloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. \nHIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision of the Police Officer. \nHe takes off after it, but to no avail. LLOYD You can't do this! I'll lose my job! \nAs Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his fingers through his hair. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON \nWe see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building. They disappear inside without acknowledging each other. \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat. They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE \nMENTAL). \nMENTAL Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for? \nSHAY I don't know, but we'd better find out... \nMental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them. \nSHAY (CONT'D) Your ulcer? \nMENTAL It ain't gonna kill me. \nINT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR \nLloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently toward the door of their apartment. \nINT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM \nLloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY, tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY. \nThe place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture with stuffing spilling out of the gashes. \nHARRY I got fired again. \nLloyd shakes his head. \nLLOYD I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense. \nHARRY None taken. Were you shitcanned, too? \nLLOYD Of course not. (beat) I quit. \nHARRY Why'd you quit? \nLLOYD I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire me. \nINT. HARRY & LLOYD'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nJ.P. Shay is looking through Harry and Lloyd's kitchen cupboards as Joe Mental comes out of the bedroom. \nMENTAL The briefcase ain't here. He must've taken it with him. \nJ.P. SHAY Shit. (beat) Well he's gotta come home sometime. \nJoe Mental ominously approaches Petey the parakeet's cage. \nMENTAL Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we're playing hardball. \nMental opens the cage door and wraps his meaty fist around the bird, who SCREECHES IN \nTERROR. \nMENTAL (CONT'D) (a la Tweety Bird) I taut I taw a puddy cat. \nMental smiles, and as we PAN to J.P. Shay, we hear a bone- chilling O.S. SNAP and Petey the bird stops SQUAWKING. \nMENTAL (CONT'D) (still Tweety) I did, I did... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe Mutt Cuts van pulls up to the curb. A depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance. \nLLOYD Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few necessities. \nHarry hands his friend some crumpled bills. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) What's cheaper, Thunderbird or Night Train? \nHARRY Get Robitussin it's a better buzz. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nLloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries. He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and removes a quarter. \nHe drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper. He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper, and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET STILL INSIDE. \nLloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN struggles by using a WALKER. \nLLOYD Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar? \nELDERLY WOMAN Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't... \nLLOYD Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine. \nELDERLY LADY Of course, young man... \nLloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters. Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER, AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he sees that \nSHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nA thoroughly beleaguered Lloyd is trudging empty-handed up the steps to his apartment. \nINT. LLOYD & HARRY'S APARTMENT \nThe door opens and Lloyd ENTERS. Harry is sitting on the couch, looking almost comatose. \nHARRY Where's the booze? \nLLOYD It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too. \nHarry drops his head and lets out a MOAN. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Come on, man, cheer up. We've been own before. I'm sure we'll land on our heads somewhere. HARRY It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead. \nLloyd looks touched by this. \nLLOYD Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What happened? \nHARRY His head fell off. \nLLOYD His head fell off? \nHARRY Yeah, he was pretty old. \nLloyd puts his hand on Harry's shoulder compassionately. \nHarry considers this, then sheepishly puts his seatbelt back on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio. \nHARRY Where'd you get those? \nLLOYD Bought 'em when we filled up. \nHARRY Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember? \nLLOYD This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style. \nHARRY Where'd you get twenty-five extra bucks? \nLLOYD I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C. \nHARRY You mean the blind kid? \nLLOYD That's right. \nLloyd looks out the window guiltily. \nHARRY What did you sell him, Lloyd? \nLLOYD Just some odds and ends. \nHARRY Specifically? \nLLOYD Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to? \nHARRY But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a head. \nLLOYD Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nAt the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the ead bird up, but it flops into his lap. \nBILLY Fly! \nJoe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door. It reads: TO ALL OUR \nLOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE - LLOYD AND HARRY. \nPULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay. \nMENTAL Those bastards. They're rubbing it right in our faces. \nJ.P. SHAY Shit! Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we don't get that briefcase back. MENTAL Don't   worry, we'll get it back. And I'll   tell you something else. They ain't   gonna reach Aspen, either. I'll   make sure of that. \nMental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on them. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nA pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs. Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the air. \nBILLY Come on, boy, fly! \nPlop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS OUT: \nBILLY (CONT'D) Excuse me, mister. Is there something wrong with my bird? \nMental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can. \nMENTAL Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew south for the winter. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - AFTERNOON \nHarry is still driving while Lloyd studies a map spread out before him. \nHARRY How far have we gone? \nLLOYD According to this map, about an inch and a half. \nHARRY Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money. LLOYD Relax. We have more than enough. \nHARRY I believe you're wrong, Lloyd. \nLLOYD And I believe I'm right, Harry. \nLLOYD Or was it the left shoulder? \nThey turn and see a burly TRUCKER wiping salt out of his eyes. \nTRUCKER Who's the dead man threw shit in my eye? \nThe huge Trucker stands and squints at Lloyd and Harry. He's wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM, SIXTY-NINE 'EM. \nHARRY It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology. \nThe Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly FRIENDS. \nBURLY FRIEND #1 Teach him a lesson, Sea Bass! \nSea Bass glares down at Harry's hamburger. \nSEA BASS You gonna eat that? \nHARRY Um... the thought had crossed my mind. \nAt this, Sea Bass leans over and DROPS A BIG, BROWN WAD OF TOBACCO SPIT ONTO \nTHE HAMBURGER. \nSEA BASS Still want it? \nHarry stares at the burger non-commitally. \nHARRY Nah, you go ahead. \nSea Bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to the LAUGHTER of his friends. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRUCK STOP CAF\u00c9 - AFTERNOON \nJ.P. Shay is at the gas pump filling the black Cadillac while Joe Mental stretches his legs. A large truck pulls away, REVEALING THE PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN MUTT CUTTS VAN. Mental smiles at this, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRUCK STOP CAF\u00c9 The Waitress drops the check on Lloyd and Harry's table and STOMPS away. Harry studies the bill and SIGHS. \nHARRY Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten. \nLLOYD Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals... (brightening) Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me... \nLloyd stands and walks over to Sea Bass and his pals. A nervous Harry trails after him. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Excuse me, gentlemen, I'd just like to apologize for that unpleasant scene a little earlier. \nSEA BASS Huh? \nLLOYD What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the hatchet. \nHarry stares at Lloyd like he's out of his mind, but the Truckers seem to like the idea. \nSEA BASS Make it four boiler-makers. \nLLOYD Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road. \nLloyd and Harry move away from the table toward the CASHIER. \nHARRY Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks. \nLloyd hands the Cashier their check. \nLLOYD Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab. \nCASHIER (skeptical) Sea Bass said that? \nLLOYD Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass... \nHe points across the room to Sea Bass and company. Sea Bass NODS TO THE CASHIER AND GESTURES TO HIS TABLE, NOT WANTING TO MISS OUT ON HIS FREE DRINK. The Cashier is convinced. \nCASHIER Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants... \nHarry smiles at this. He grabs a couple Beef Jerky's, a candy bar, and a copy of The National Enquirer off the counter. \nHARRY Oh, and put these on there, too. \nCASHIER You got it. \nLLOYD (to Cashier) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here? \nCUT TO: \nHarry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper. \nHARRY (calling out) No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for noticing! \nHe rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled Lloyd. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Jesus, what is this, the fashion police? \nThe Cop turns on his SIREN. \nSTATE TROOPER PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE \nROAD! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - LATE DAY \nThe STATE TROOPER is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts van, staring at it with isapproval. \nSTATE TROOPER License and registration, please. \nHarry hands him the papers. STATE TROOPER (CONT'D) You know, you fellas were all over the road back there. \nHARRY Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty in the car. \nSTATE TROOPER Uh-huh. (beat) Have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe? \nHARRY No, sir. \nSTATE TROOPER Then what's that? \nHe points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat between them. \nHARRY Oh, that's nothing, sir. \nSTATE TROOPER Do you know it's against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state? \nLLOYD But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer. \nThe officer smirks. \nSTATE TROOPER Is that right? \nThe Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He inspects the beer label, then MOVES \nTHE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS. \nHARRY Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. \nLLOYD (under breath) YOU WOULD, TOO... \nHarry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then: \nSTATE TROOPER (pained) Get the hell out of here. \nCUT TO: \nThe Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on his knees. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe van is making steady progress through the dark night. \nINT. MUTT CUTT VAN - NIGHT \nLloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger seat. The song, \"Cut Flowers\" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLLOYD'S FANTASY: \nLloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow... \nLloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her, she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances over her shoulder at him. \nCAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of two people behind the curtain. \nLLOYD (v.o.) \nOOH... OOH... MARY... \nMARY (v.o.) How does that feel, Lloyd? \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nThe room has a dirt floor. There's a stone WELL in the middle. We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the well. Andre walks to the edge of the dark hole. \nANDRE How you doing today, Melvin? \nAndre takes a hit off his cigarette and flicks it into the well. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate. \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nLloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd Rundgren's \"Too Far Gone\" begins to play while Harry peers at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: \nA new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep with his feet now on Harry's lap. \nAnother sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window and his head is on Harry's lap. \nThe next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out. \nFinally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD, GAS NEXT EXIT. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING \nThe Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background are several tractor-trailer rigs and a caf\u00e9. Harry climbs out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the passenger door. \nLloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him with his foot. \nHARRY Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump. \nLloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet. \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nHarry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up. \nEXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room. When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock. \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nHarry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out. This seems to wake Harry up. \nThe Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods to the skis on her   roof-rack. \nHARRY Skis, huh? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY That's right. \nHARRY Great. \nShe continues to pump gas. \nHARRY (CONT'D) They yours? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Uh-huh.. \nHARRY Both of 'em? \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Um, yeah. \nHARRY (impressed) Cool. \nTHE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS \nlike a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere. \nHarry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself. \nINT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM \nLloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, \nA.M. SHARP. \nHe frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch. \nCLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8. \nWHISTLE. \nHARRY You've got some serious explaining to o, young man. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP - of Harry's BURNT SHOE     with the toes sticking out on the accelerator. \nLLOYD Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it. HARRY Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants own. \nLLOYD That's a low blow, man. \nHARRY Not at that height it's not. \nLLOYD Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado. \nLLOYD SQUINTS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. A SIGN UP AHEAD SAYS: LAST EXIT IN NEBRASKA - \nCOLORADO STATE LINE - 3 MILES. \nHARRY I think it's about   time we pull over and change seats.   I've been driving for nine straight   hours I  don't have the energy to   start a new state. \nLloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON A SIGN - it reads WELCOME  TO COLORADO, HOME OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. PAN DOWN to reveal  a number of POLICEMEN stopping and checking cars as they  cross the border. A HELICOPTER lands on the side of the  road and Detective Dale hops out. He hurries to the COP in  charge. \nDT. DALE Any sign of them yet? \nCOP No, but we're expecting them shortly. A motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this way. \nDetective Dale nods, satisfied. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MINI MART - NIGHT ESTABLISHING SHOT of a mini mart. \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nThe door opens and Lloyd gets in carrying a bag of Doritos and a soda. He settles into the driver's seat and pulls a Beef Jerky out of his back pocket. \nLLOYD Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky... \nWhen he gets no response, he notices that Harry is already fast asleep in the passenger seat. Lloyd shakes his head. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Boy, some guys just weren't cut out for life on the road. \nEXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT \nLloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - SUNNY MORNING \nIt's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open. \nLLOYD Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back. \nHARRY (groggy) How long have I been out? \nLLOYD I'd say a good five hours, anyway. \nHarry yawns and stretches. \nHARRY Great. We must be getting real close, huh? \nLLOYD Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night. \nHARRY Good man. \nLLOYD Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize. \nHARRY That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there? \nLLOYD I hit 'em. \nHarry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS. \nHARRY Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this. \nLLOYD I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit, huh? \nHARRY Where'd you find this baby? \nLLOYD Used car dealer. I   traded the van for it. Plus I got   the guy to throw in fifty bucks for   gas money. (beat) Come on, man, what   do you say? We still partners? \nHARRY SMILES AND WE \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COLORADO STATE LINE - DAY \nAn impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the Colorado border with several other officers. \nDT. DALE It doesn't make sense. They should've been here hours ago. \nCOP Maybe they're smarter than we thought. \nDT. DALE How smart can they be? They're riving a goddamn dog! \nAnother COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie. \nCOP #2 We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on I-80. \nDT. DALE (incredulous) Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred miles from here! \nCOP #1 Guess they got wind of our welcoming party. \nDT. DALE We're wasting time. Let's mobilize. \nDt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow. As the officers climb into their cars, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. HEARSE - DAY \nLloyd is driving and Harry has his feet out the window. \nLLOYD Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I hadn't come back to get you? \nHARRY Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember that? \nLloyd thinks hard about this. \nLLOYD We were never Cub Scouts. \nHARRY Exactly. \nJust then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN in the rear of the vehicle. \nHARRY (CONT'D) What the hell is this? There's a coffin in the back! \nLLOYD Relax, it's empty. \nHARRY I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nHarry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse. Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is a CADILLAC. \nINT. CADILLAC (LEAD CAR) - DAY \n(This is the car right behind the funeral hearse.) A MAN and a WOMAN are arguing. \nWOMAN I married a cheapskate. \nMAN Shut your trap, Gerdie. \nWOMAN I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be able to show my face again. \nMAN I knew something good would come out of this. \nWOMAN We could have given him a more ignified burial. \nMAN Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth? A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm gonna spend a load to get him planted. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nWhile the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY \nFOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY SUPERMARKET - DAY \nHarry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back. Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER AND WIPE THEIR HANDS \nLLOYD Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder. \nHarry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted. He opens the car door and starts to climb out. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) What are you going out there for? \nHARRY To warm up. \nEXT. HEARSE - NIGHT Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side. \nLLOYD What are you worrying about now? \nHARRY I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you. \nLLOYD Huh? \nSuddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd manages to evade his grasp. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Harry, calm down! You're acting like a wild animal! \nHARRY Get over here and take your medicine, Lloyd! \nLLOYD Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist! \nLloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated, Harry opens the car and PULLS THE \nBRIEFCASE OUT. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nHARRY Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along. \nHarry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river. \nLLOYD Don't do anything foolish, Harry. \nHARRY Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river. Lloyd starts to follow after Harry. \nLLOYD You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this! \nHarry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose of the briefcase. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get better, I promise! In fact, I think \nI feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's yours, Harry, all yours! \nHarry stops in his tracks, intrigued. \nHARRY You're bluffing. \nLLOYD No I'm not, man look. \nLloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints at it. \nHARRY That's a filling, you liar! \nJust then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs, but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another in the snow, rolling over and over. \nFinally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on top and CLASPS HIS HANDS \nAROUND LLOYD'S THROAT. \nHARRY (CONT'D) I used to have a life! A miserable one, but a life, nonetheless! \nSuddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S. behind his friend. \nLLOYD (CHOKED VOICE) Harry, look! \nHarry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd as we see THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND, REVEALING STACKS AND \nSTACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN ASPEN - NIGHT \nHarry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland. \nLLOYD Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel. \nHARRY Sounds good. \nLLOYD And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs. \nHARRY We'll be meticulous    right down to the last penny. \nHelen grabs the mug from Mary and hands her the other one. \nHELEN (CONT'D) Feeling any better, honey? \nMary can't take her eyes from the window. \nMARY Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who... (fighting back tears) It's all my fault. I should've been there. \nHELEN Bullshit. You can't blame yourself for this. If you'd been there they would've taken you, too. \nHelen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit. \nMARY Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over \nwith. \nHELEN Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done. You've got to stop torturing yourself. \nMARY What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine? \nHELEN That's exactly what you should do. Get the hell out more, go skiing, socialize. Don't you see, honey? We can't let on that anything is wrong. If the press or authorities get wind of this, the kidnappers might panic. (beat) Who knows what they'd do to poor Melvin then? \nAS MARY THINKS ABOUT THIS, WE \nCUT TO: EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY \nThe Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse. Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely. \nINT. BEDROOM - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT \nThe huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies. Lloyd is going through it all. Harry is sitting out on the balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the mountain view. \nHARRY Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming. \nLLOYD It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time. \nHARRY And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money. \nHarry LIGHTS A CIGAR WITH A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL, takes a hearty puff, and \nEXHALES. \nHARRY (CONT'D) You know, Lloyd, I think you might've gone a little overboard with the spending today. \nHe blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony. \nLLOYD What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right? \nHARRY Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards? \nLLOYD Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis. This suddenly makes sense to Harry. \nHARRY Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them. \nLloyd opens a box and holds up a SCANTY NEGLIGEE. \nLLOYD Where'd this come from? \nHARRY (sheepishly) I bought it. \nLLOYD What for? \nHARRY I like the feel of it against my skin... (defensive) ...I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it. \nLloyd inspects it more closely. \nLLOYD Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL? \nHARRY Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few eccentricities. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door. \nLLOYD Enter, parlez vous! \nThe Bell Captain, Barnard, ENTERS with a champagne bucket and a newspaper under his arm. \nBARNARD I brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen. Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested. \nLloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns. \nLLOYD All out of Boone's Farm, huh? BARNARD You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon. \nLLOYD Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh? \nLloyd smiles and over tips him. \nJ.P. SHAY (WHISPERING) Jesus Christ, boss... it's them. \nBACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through the affluent crowd. \nLLOYD I'm getting nervous, Harry. \nHARRY relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me. \nLLOYD What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and sophisticated. \nHARRY So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound. \nHe points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party. Lloyd rolls his eyes. \nLLOYD Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me? \nHARRY Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas over-confidence. \nThe guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they make their way to the bar. \nLLOYD (to BARTENDER) Two martinis, straight up. As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then walks away. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) Shut up, Harry. \nHARRY I didn't say anything. \nLLOYD Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance. \nHARRY How do you know what I was gonna say? \nLLOYD I read you like a book. \nHARRY Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say? \nLLOYD You were gonna say: (in Harry's looped VOICE) 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.' \nHarry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) And I would say 'shut up', because this is our chance to get in with the rich and powerful and you don't ingratiate yourself to the kind of people by acting like Ron Jeremy on Spanish Fly. \nThe Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s. CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to \nsee Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and Elizabeth Swanson. \nANDRE If I could have your attention, please... \nThe crowd QUIETS. ANDRE (CONT'D) I'd like to thank you all for coming to this very special event. As you \nKNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - \nfounded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of endangered species. Our \nSPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY- \nthree separate varieties of animals that are currently listed on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight, we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our twenty-fourth. \nThe crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the podium. \nMR. SWANSON Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl. \nHe pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS. \nMR. SWANSON (CONT'D) These magnificent specimens were \nRESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE- \nyear, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on the planet. \nON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks pale. \nMR. SWANSON Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more. \nMore APPLAUSE. \nMR. SWANSON (CONT'D) Again, thank you, and enjoy your evening. Oh, and feel free to take a closer look at our new friends here. Enjoy. \nThe crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass. \nLLOYD Two more, please. \nHarry stares at Lloyd with concern. \nHARRY Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out. \nLLOYD I can't help it. This is a very important night for me. (MORE) \nHARRY Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you both. \nHELEN I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to meet. \nHARRY (taken aback) You were? \nHELEN That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary. \nMary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry. \nHARRY Really? \nFor a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Anyway, about my friend you doing anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because I believe Mary's looking for somebody to hit the slopes with. Whuh? \nMARY Helen, you're embarrassing me. \nHELEN Well you are, aren't you? (to Harry) Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you available? \nHarry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a hopeful Lloyd. \nHARRY Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball. \nMary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Um... well... I don't know. You see, the thing is... sure. \nON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns. \nLLOYD How come you didn't call me over? \nHARRY Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow. \nLloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's SPEECHLESS. \nLLOYD Wha... you... I... it's... (smiles) I love you, man. I love you! \nLloyd clamps an embarrassed Harry in a TIGHT EMBRACE. \nHARRY Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene. \nLloyd steps back elated. \nLLOYD This calls for a toast! \nHe grabs a bottle of champagne out of a bucket and starts to open it. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) You're gonna be my best man, Har, I mean it. It was always between you and my future wife's brother, but you just earned a seat at the head table, pal. \nSuddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND ZIPS ACROSS \nTHE ROOM LIKE A BULLET   DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN WIDER- \nEYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP! \nA HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage. \nTHEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE CAGE, AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW \nOwls LIES ON ITS BACK, its species now one bird closer to extinction. \nHarry and Lloyd look on in horror. Harry takes the smoking champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar. \nHARRY (under breath) I think we've done enough hobnobbing, Lloyd. \nThe guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for Nicholas Andre, that is; we PAN to show that he's been standing nearby watching their every move. And he doesn't look very happy. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AASPEN APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while J.P. Shay looks on nervously. \nJ.P. SHAY Maybe it was just a coincidence. \nANDRE Don't be stupid. It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours. \nJ.P. SHAY But how could anybody off a bird with a cork? \nANDRE These guys arent' just anybody. They're good. Look what they did to Mental. He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web. \nJ.P. SHAY But the bastards already got our money. What the hell more could they want? \nAndre runs his fingers through his hair. \nHARRY Why not? \nMARY (evasive) There's been... family problems. I on't want to bore you with them. \nHARRY Thanks. \nHe looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Oh, look... frost. \nHe licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge. \nMARY Are you okay? \nHARRY (lisping) Sure. I do this all the time... CUT TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY \nAs Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary disembarks but Harry stays on. \nHARRY (lisping) See ya at the bottom... \nHarry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down the hill. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN - DAY \nThe chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him. \nHARRY (lisping) Hi. (off their looks) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you? \nThe two kids just stare at him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AVALANCHE BAR & GRILL - AFTERNOON \nA despondent   Lloyd's got a couple of empties in front of him now. The bar   is open and there are a few CUSTOMERS sprinkled about. Lloyd   takes a sip of his drink and looks up at the clock on the   wall. It's 12:30. \nWe see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him. PAN OVER to reveal that it's the Athletic Beauty that Harry had tried to pick up at the truck stop. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Hi. \nLloyd GRUNTS a hello. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) Bad day, huh? \nLloyd GRUNTS once more. ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D) (big smile) well don't worry, Mercury's supposed to be coming out or retrograde tonight. Things will get better. \nAS LLOYD GRUNTS AGAIN, WE \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BASE LODGE - AFTERNOON \nMary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE- TAKE. \nMARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH \nhas been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g. \nBACK TO SCENE \nMARY My god. Harry, are you okay? \nHARRY (lisping) I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP of Harry's head through a RIFLE SCOPE. REVERSE ANGLE to reveal J.P. Shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a high-powered rifle trained on Harry. \nSHAY You're luck just ran out, pal. \nAs his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go \nBACK TO SCENE \nMARY This is silly. Let me help you... \nMary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously. She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY... FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly, his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain: \nMIME GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?! \nThe poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him. \nHARRY (o.s.) Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances. \nLloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF EX-LAX. \nLLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN. \nWHEN HARRY COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET DRESSED IN A NEW SUIT AND TIE, LLOYD DOES A DOUBLE- \ntake. \nLLOYD Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't you? \nHARRY Uh... it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door. \nLLOYD I see. \nLloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his own glass. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) To my friend Harry the matchmaker. \nHarry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway. HARRY Mmmmm... \nHe GULPS DOWN THE DRINK. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HEARSE - NIGHT \nHarry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach. \nEXT. SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT \nThe hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets his insides under control, and continues to the front porch, where he RINGS the bell. \nMary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings. \nMARY Hi. Come on in. \nINT. SWANSON CHALET \nHarry follows her inside. \nMARY Make yourself at home. I'm almost ready. Just give me one more minute. \nAs she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and rushes inside. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he hears a KNOCK on the door. \nMARY (o.s.) Are you in there, Harry? HARRY (nervously) Be right out. \nMARY (o.s.) I hope you're not using the toilet. It's broken. \nZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible SWEAT breaks out on his forehead. \nHARRY Huh? \nMARY (o.s.) It doesn't flush. \nHARRY Um, no, I was just... shaving. \nEXT. HALLWAY \nA confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door. \nMARY Shaving? \nHARRY (o.s.) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time. \nMARY Okay. Well I'll be in the living room whenever you're ready. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHarry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the toilet tank. He starts tinkering with a few valves. \nHARRY (under breath) Come on, flush, you bastard... \nEXT. LIVING ROOM - SWANSON CHALET - NIGHT \nMary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed. She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV. ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing the CAMERA gravely: \nREPORTER We'll be back in a minute with the story of the blind Indiana boy who was duped into buying a dead parakeet. \nWe see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head Scotch taped on its body. \nShe can't believe her ears. \nMARY That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. \nHe drops his head and Mary leans over and kisses him on the cheek. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HEARSE - NIGHT \nA sullen Harry is driving back to the hotel. \nHARRY (MUMBLING to himself) It's all Kharma, Harry. You screw your best friend over and it's gonna come back to haunt you, plain and simple... \nCUT TO: \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE \nCLOSE ON LLOYD'S FACE - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills his guts. \nLLOYD Look, Mary, I know this may seem a little sudden but I've given it a lot of thought: You're the woman I've been waiting for my whole life, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- (holds up his hand) --Please, let me finish. (DEEP BREATH) I'm crazy about you. I've never felt this way about anyone. You make it so easy for me to tell you my innermost desires. (NERVOUS LAUGH) Listen to me, I feel like a schoolboy again. (beat) A schoolboy who desperately wants to make sweet, sweet love to you. \nSuddenly we hear   TOILET FLUSHING O.S. \nREVERSE ANGLE REVEALS that Lloyd has been talking to an EMPTY CHAIR. The bathroom oor opens and Mary comes out. She looks around, expecting to see someone else. \nMARY Oh... I thought I heard you talking to someone. \nLloyd is flustered. He swallows hard. It's the moment of truth. \nLLOYD Mary... (BLURTING OUT) I desperately want to make love to a schoolboy. \nMARY (taken aback) Maybe I should be going now. \nLLOYD No, that's not what Imeant. I meant... I really like you, Mary. I like you a lot. \nShe smiles at this. \nLLOYD (CONT'D) I'm gonna ask you something flat out and I want you to answer me honestly: What do you think the chances are of a girl like you and a guy like me ending up together? \nMary is obviously thrown by this question. \nMARY Lloyd, that's difficult to say. I \nmean we hardly -- \nLLOYD --I asked you to be honest, Mary. MARY But Lloyd, I really can't -- \nLLOYD --Come    on, give it to me straight. I rove a    long way to see you, the least you can    do is level with me. What are my    chances? \nMARY Not good. \nBEAT \nLLOYD You mean not good, like one out of a hundred? \nMARY I'd say more like one out of a million. \nBEAT \nLLOYD (Duh) So you're telling me there's a chance? \nJust then, there's a KNOCK at the door. When Lloyd opens it, he's face to face with Nicholas Andre. \nMARY Nicholas... what are you doing here? \nANDRE I've been looking for you, Mary. \nI've got some interesting news about your husband. \nLloyd looks at MAry, devastated. \nLLOYD Husband? \nANDRE Aren't you two going to invite me in? \nLloyd and Mary hear a CLICK and turn to see Andre POINTING A GUN at them. Andre steps into the room, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL DANBURY - LOBBY - NIGHT As Harry mopes through the lobby, we hear someone CALL OUT: \nWOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Hey! \nHarry turns to see the Athletic Beauty approaching. \nLloyd can't muster a defense. LLOYD Look... I was gonna tell you about that. It was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. I swear, you can ask my lawyer. \nHarry glares at him. \nHARRY Well I guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we? \nLLOYD You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were. \nHARRY Guess not. \nLLOYD I mean, if one beautiful girl   could rip us apart like this, then   it seems our friendship isn't worth a   damn. (beat) Maybe we should call it quits   right here. \nHARRY Just tell me where to sign, bud. \nSuddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING COCKED. \nANDRE Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first? \nThe guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD. \nHARRY I wouldn't pull that trigger if I were you. \nANDRE Why not? It'll look like just another Aspen love triangle. You caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself. \nHARRY (smug) Except you're forgetting one minor etail. \nANDRE What's that? \nLloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful. \nHARRY If you kill us, you'd be killing yourself. \nANDRE (puzzled) Huh? \nHARRY You see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. In other words, I am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened \nidiot -- \nANDRE --Shut up! \nMary sees that they're in deep shit now. \nMARY What about my husband? Did you kill him, too? \nHARRY Husband? What husband? \nLLOYD Mary's married, Harry. \nANDRE No need to worry about Melvin. (beat) Now this is the last time I'll ask: Who wants to die first? \nHarry gestures with his head at Mary. \nHARRY Kill her. The bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. It would've saved us a lot of trouble. \nAndre points the gun at Mary. \nLLOYD No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the one who got you into this mess. \nAndre points the gun at Lloyd. \nHARRY No, wait, do me first. I'm the one who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve it. \nAndre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor. \nLLOYD Jesus Christ! You killed my best friend, you bastard! \nAndre smiles. \nANDRE If it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited. \nHe aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand. \nON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned Nicholas Andre. \nLLOYD Harry! You're alive! \nJust them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS storm in with their weapons drawn. \nCOP #1 Get your hands up, asshole! \nLloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. \nThere's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She flashes an ID. \nATHLETIC BEAUTY Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal Bureau of Investigation. \n", "test1_input": "ANDRE I don't like this one goddamn bit, Mental. You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit. Now I don't know what the hell's going on. \nAndre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip. The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again. \nMENTAL Hold on a second, Mr. Andre... \nMental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks the Anxious Man out cold. Then \nMental picks up the phone again. \nMENTAL (CONT'D) Sorry, boss. You were saying...? \nANDRE Look, Mental, just find out what they're up to. I want to know who these guys are. \nMENTAL Don't worry. I'm on it. \nMental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van. He's joined by J.P. Shay. \nAs they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing. \nSHAY What the fuck...? \nFinally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING. Mental jumps back and pulls his gun. \nMENTAL Where's the goddamn dog? \nShay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now, forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.

SEATED ON A COUCH ARE HER FATHER KARL AND HIS MUCH- \nyounger second wife, HELEN. \nMARY It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to. \nHELEN Actually, it makes a great deal of sense, Mary. We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped. \nKARL Now, Helen, we've been through this already for Christ's sake, Karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them. \nMARY But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin. \nKARL Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen. She's been through quite enough already. MARY It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge. \nJust then the living room door opens and the pony tailed Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn. \nANDRE Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson? \nKARL Nothing yet, Nicholas. \nAndre looks upset. \nANDRE Perhaps I should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend. \nIT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO RE- \nschedule. \nHELEN No, Nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual. \nThe atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. Karl Swanson holds his hand out to his aughter. \nKARL Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do everything they ask. Nothing's going to happen to Melvin, I promise you. \nMARY Thank you, Daddy. \nKarl Swanson looks out the window, concerned. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

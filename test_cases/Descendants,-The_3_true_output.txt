Matt smiles -- he'd been expecting a grim moment alone with Elizabeth, but instead he finds a room full of warmth and life. Even if it's a little creepy. 
MARK So what's the latest anyway, Matt?    Any updates? 
MATT No, no. Just more of the same -- monitoring the swelling, keeping her                        * kidneys and other vitals working, you                       * know, hoping for the best. 
Kai nods sympathetically before turning back to Elizabeth. 
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Liz's lips as Kai applies lipstick. 
31   EXT. KALAKAUA AVENUE - DAY                                          31 
JOGGERS go past as Matt's car pulls into the driveway of the OCEAN OUTRIGGER CLUB. 
32   EXT. OCEAN OUTRIGGER BEACH - DAY                                    32 
Matt lies on the beach watching Scottie play in the surf with her snorkel mask on. The melancholy he feels makes him regard his weird little daughter with tenderness. 
SCOTTIE (emerging from the water) I'm hungry! 
MATT What else is new?   Let's get you something to eat. 
33   EXT. OCEAN OUTRIGGER RESTAURANT - DAY                               33 
Scottie pops two last FRIES into her mouth, then turns her attention to a strawberry SUNDAE. 
Anxious to spoil her, Matt watches Scottie dig in.        Yet he remains preoccupied, his smile distant.

SCOTTIE The food here at the club is so good. 
MATT Yeah, they do a good job here. 
SCOTTIE Why is it called a jellyfish?      It's not a fish, and it's not jelly. 
MATT No idea. You ask good questions. You're getting too smart for me, Scottie. 
SCOTTIE I'm going to find out. Then I'm going to ask Mom when she wakes up and see if she knows. Do you think she's going to know everything she used to know? 
Matt notices a BUFF GUY and some FRIENDS headed to a nearby table, and his mood sours. Scottie follows his gaze. 
The guy notices the Kings and feels obliged to mosey over. This is TROY COOK -- athletic and rich. 
TROY Hi, Matt.    Hi, Scottie. 
MATT Troy. 
TROY (to his friends) I'll catch up to you guys in a second. 
Matt stares so intensely that Troy averts his gaze. 
TROY (CONT'D) So, uh, what's going on?      I mean, how's Elizabeth doing? 
MATT Same. 
TROY I visited her last week, you know.      I thought she looked pretty good. 
MATT So why'd you ask? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 33   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   33 
TROY I don't know, I just wanted to know the latest. I'm praying for her every day, you guys. Really hard. Seriously. So what I was saying was, when I was there, I talked to her, and her hand moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I thought that was an encouraging sign. 
Scottie looks up hopefully.   Matt notices. 
MATT That's enough. 
TROY I really think she heard me. 
MATT Look, Troy, go to your friends. No hard feelings. Let's just leave it alone. 
Troy walks away, stops, turns back. 
TROY I told you, Matt, there were lots of chops and holes that day. I told you a hundred times. Ask anybody. What happened to her could have happened to me. It was a super-hard day on the water. 
MATT You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy. She was supposed to be driving. 
TROY She wanted me to drive. And she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn. And just your whole attitude toward me, Matt -- I mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were me and not her. Plus I almost drowned myself when we capsized. And my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and I'm going to miss Moloka'i.

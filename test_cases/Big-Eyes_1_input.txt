GANNETT LAWYER We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. 
(BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. He looks very small and pale. The Judge peers quizzically. 
JUDGE Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. 
WALTER I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! 
(BEAT) Let's PROCEED!

INT. DICK NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Dick frantically types at his typewriter. 
DICK (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
Walter stands down front. Like a Broadway star, center-stage. 
WALTER I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world -- 
JUDGE Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. 
WALTER Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. 
(BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. 
WALTER Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- 
JUDGE 
MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words. 
WALTER Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? 
We slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET. This is her moment. And then -- quietly, she speaks. 
MARGARET I was forced into it. You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. 
MARGARET He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad... 
WALTER (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps. 
WALTER S-sorry. Margaret turns back to the Jury. 
MARGARET I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... 
(SHE SIGHS) I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. 
(SOFT) Maybe he was right... 
(TO WALTER) You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. 
WALTER Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. Margaret stares him in the eyes. 
MARGARET That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde.

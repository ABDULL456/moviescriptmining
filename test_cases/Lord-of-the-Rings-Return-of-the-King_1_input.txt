DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FOOTHILLS OF WHITE MOUNTAINS - DAY 
ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE. 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND sailing through his hair. 
GANDALF We have just passed into the realm of Condor! 
EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN 
ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . . 
ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out- thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH. 
With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. 
GANDALF Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings. 
Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS in the morning breeze. 
EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - DAY 
GANDALF steering SHADOWFAX up the STEEP STREETS of MINAS TIRITH. (CONTINUED) 
Final Revision - October, 2003 29. CONTINUED: 
ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . . 
AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up towards the 7th LEVEL. 
MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL. 
A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP. 
EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY 
SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS. 
GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . . 
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT, FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it. 
PIPPIN                             ; (whisper) It's the tree.           , (hurrying after GANDALF) Gandalf! Gandalf! 
GANDALF Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. 
GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES, surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         ' 
GANDALF (cont'd) Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He is a steward only. A caretaker of the throne.

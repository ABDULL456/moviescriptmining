{"train": "\"Dark City\", early, by Alex Proyas \nDARK CITY \nby Alex Proyas \nREVISED DRAFT November 29th, 1992 \nDARKNESS \nA LOW RUMBLE increases in volume. \nFADE UP: \nA BLACK-GLOVED HAND wraps around a bulky electrical lever, thrusts FORWARD. \nSNAP!  -  Electricity arcs through darkness. \nO.S. sound of MACHINERY turning ON. \nTITLES OVER \nMONTAGE OF CLOCKS starting  -  various.  Second hands turn  - TICKING gets louder. \nINT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT \nSHADOWS DANCE.  A bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing: clothes on a chair, puddles of water on the floor... \nSLEEPING EYES in and out of darkness.  The eyes open. Confusion. \nWIDEN ANGLE ON JONATHAN WHITE  -  a man in his early thirties, dark featured. \nHe sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub of long cold water. His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever. \nHe looks down into the murky water around him.  A feint movement beneath the surface, something swimming  -  A SMALL DARK SHAPE.  Startled, he leaps from the bath. \nANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  The man's hand reaches up, stops the light-bulb mid swing. \nHe steps to a circular window.  The glass is cracked, covered in grime.  He wipes it, this only smears the dirt. \nIt's dark out there. \nEXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT \nANGLE ON WHITE  -  from outside the window, through blurry glass. \nA RAPID FLYING P.O.V. PULLS BACK in silence.  The window is a SPECK on the side of a vast grey tower. \nBACK IN THE BATHROOM \nWhite shivers, cold.  He stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor.  He looks at his feet and legs, covered with numerous SMALL BITES.  He dries the bloody wounds with a towel. \nHe picks up the clothes lying on the chair, puts them on. Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt, leathers shoes with HOLES in both soles.  In his trouser pocket he finds a key  - a room number on a plastic tag. \nHe hears splashing in the bath-tub.  He steps over, looks into the murky water.  Suddenly a SMALL SILVER FISH leaps from the water, lands at his feet, panting heavily and flapping about. \nHe leans down, picks the fish up, throws it back into the water. \nLike a blind man, he feels the walls, comes to a door in the shadows.  He hears something on the other side, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob.  He leans down. \nTIGHT ON HIS EYE \nBlinking through the key-hole. \nP.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door across the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM  -  NIGHT \nWHITE pushes the door open, steps into the adjoining room. \nNo sign of life.  Cheap decorations.  He walks around cautiously.  Turns lights on.  Then reconsiders.  Turns them off again.  Disturbed, he studies his features in a wall mirror. \nANGLE ON OPEN BATHROOM DOOR  -  the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor. \nWhite steps back into the bathroom.  He picks up the fish again, doesn't know what to do with it, so he puts it in his pocket. \nBACK IN THE OTHER ROOM \nHe searches through things.  A grey overcoat in the closet.  He goes through the pockets, finds a WALLET.  No I.D., just a laundry bill, some money and a postcard from a sea-side town. \nANGLE ON A REVOLVER on the bed-side table.  He picks it up, his grip tightens on the handle, his finger applies pressure to the trigger and... \nBANG! \nThe gun goes off.  A BULLET RICOCHETS wildly around the room, bounces off the metal bed-head, smashes a vase, embeds itself in the wall. \nStartled, he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again.  He examines it carefully now.  Opens the chamber. \nTIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Five bullets left. \nHe turns the chamber carefully, shuts it, puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat. \nHe moves to the bed.  A RIPPED PHOTOGRAPH on the rug.  A fragment of a woman's face, her left eye.  He lifts the fragment up.  There's handwriting on the back, part of a note: \n...MEANS THE MOST TO ME.  LOVE YOU FOREVER.  -  E... \nINSIDE THE BOOTH \nThe inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters quickly through the receiver. \nBUMSTEAD (cuts in) ...but you told me the meeting was ten-thirty. \nA burst of chatter. \nBUMSTEAD I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well, inconvenient... \nA stream of chatter stops him. \nBUMSTEAD Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes... But, I've done fine so far without an assistant... \nThe inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again... \nBUMSTEAD But...  But I...  I... (defeated) Nine-thirty.  Yes. \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM \nWe are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror. \nANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM \nWhite washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave. \nThere are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness. \nHe realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but the door CLICKS behind him:  locked. \nINT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL \nPitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A. system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away. White walks towards it. \nHe steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer. \nSuddenly White feels cold. \nVOICE O.S. There you are. \nStartled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves forward out of darkness: \nANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully. \nWhite glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor, his eyes pinned to the man. \nMYSTERY MAN You are lost, yes? \nWhite retreats faster. \nA FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side, gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on his pale face. \nWhite stops, backs against the wall. \nMYSTERY MAN Co-operate.  Do not make this difficult. \nWhite panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand shakes terribly. \nON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly. \nMYSTERY MAN You will not shoot, yes.  There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness... \nTHE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man. His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him. \nA final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A stream of black liquid spouts from the hole. \nBlue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground. \nINT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT \nCLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles. INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his nose and mouth. \nWIDER ANGLE \nBumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI. \nBUMSTEAD Good evening, sir. \nSTROMBOLI Yes.  This way. \nSTROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful- looking MORTICIAN. \nMORTICIAN Welcome, gentlemen.  You\u00edre early. Here for the examination, right? \nStromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the row of corpses.  Bumstead follows. \nSTROMBOLI The handiwork of an extremely sick individual. \nHe throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations. \nSTROMBOLI You\u00edve read the reports.  Not much to go on.  We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case... Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself. \nSTROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body, looks at the inspector. \nSTROMBOLI Why are you wearing that thing on your face? \nWhite rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular HOLE in a wall.  ANOTHER SCREAM, weaker now  -  He runs to the hole in the wall and looks through. \nHIS P.O.V. \nA small, very ordered ROOM.  A fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. \nWhite cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole.  He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson.  The man looks up  -  it\u00eds Fredrick  -  just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers.  He doesn\u00edt scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. \nSuddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of White\u00eds neck, traps his head in the hole.  He struggles, tries to free himself.  Drops the bowl of soup.  It shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. \nINSIDE THE BATHROOM  -  The killers look up at the smashing noise. \nBACK IN THE CORRIDOR  -  White pulls with all his strength. The door gives and he stumbles backwards.  He is about to run away but glances at the floor. \nThe fish is flapping about  -  still alive. \nEXT.  STREET \nWhite darts from a doorway, trips and falls.  He sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps.  He looks at a building towering above him.  Chiselled in the facade, above the entrance: LIBRARY. \nINT.  POLICE STATION \nA series of ply-wood SILHOUETTES race through frame.  Stop suddenly, mechanically.  LOUD GUNSHOTS.  Chunks of ply-wood blast away violently. \nBUMSTEAD is practising his marksmanship. \nA HAND  -  on his shoulder.  He whips around, startled. \nON MISS CRENSHAW  -  a young, stiff-looking woman. \nBUMSTEAD Dammit! \nMISS CRENSHAW Sorry, sir. \nBUMSTEAD Don\u00edt ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you? \nMISS CRENSHAW Patricia Crenshaw. \nShe puts out her hand. \nMISS CRENSHAW I\u00edm your new assistant. \nBUMSTEAD I didn\u00edt requisition a secretary. \nMISS CRENSHAW The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. \nBUMSTEAD (uncertain) Oh. \nHe takes her hand tentatively.  They shake. \nMISS CRENSHAW I\u00edve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompson\u00eds office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man. \nBUMSTEAD Good. \nMISS CRENSHAW You won\u00edt regret this, sir. \nBUMSTEAD Fine. \nBumstead moves off. \nINT.  LIBRARY \nWhite steps into a vast, empty room, stops beneath a big sign saying, SILENCE in formal letters.  The place seems abandoned, then he notices a hint of movement.  Cigarette smoke snakes into the air, a light, across the expanse of polished floor. \nHe walks up to an elderly female LIBRARIAN sitting behind a desk, smoking, reading.  White looks somewhat distraught still. \nWHITE Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing? \nThe librarian looks up from her book. \nLIBRARIAN Which would you like first? \nWHITE Okay.  Newspapers. \nShe takes her glasses off.  Her eyes are TINY, like pin-heads. She studies White. \nLIBRARIAN Are you alright? \nHe looks around  -  restrained panic. \nWHITE (looks at the woman) Sure.  I\u00edm fine. \nLIBRARIAN (nods) Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the hall.  Third floor.  Turn left. Section C-7.  Row 35, near the toilets. \nShe replaces her glasses, watches White rush away. \nLIBRARIAN Don\u00edt mention it... \nShe blows her nose into a handkerchief.  The snort ECHOES LOUDLY. \nINT.  LIBRARY CORRIDOR \nWhite rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues.  He finds section C then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes.  Comes to number 7. \nHe follows an arrow past row after row  -  finally finds Row 34 but then it skips straight to letters again, A, B, C, etc. \nMISS CRENSHAW Why, yes. \nBUMSTEAD Well be more careful, please. \nAn embarrassed beat, then: \nRI-I-I-ING! \nBumstead reaches for the phone but Crenshaw is on it first. \nCRENSHAW Inspector Bumstead\u00eds office... Yes...  Yes... \nShe cups the receiver with her hand, looks at Bumstead. \nMISS CRENSHAW Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now. \nINT.  POLICE STATION HALL-WAY \nTRACKING SHOT towards a door:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR on the frosted glass.  A hand reaches INTO FRAME, knocks twice. \nSTROMBOLI O.S. Enter! \nINSIDE \nBumstead steps into the office  -  finds STROMBOLI wandering about the room, distracted, searching for something... \nSTROMBOLI What is it? \nHe pulls the waste-basket up and empties the contents onto his desk, sorts through it. \nBUMSTEAD A formality.  I need to speak with Thompson.  Officially I need your written permission. \nStromboli is looking through his desk drawers now. \nSTROMBOLI Why do you want to speak to him? \nBUMSTEAD A hunch.  He might be able to... \nSTROMBOLI (from under desk) Bumstead, don\u00edt be so paranoid. Leave him alone  -  he\u00eds a sad case. \nBUMSTEAD It\u00eds extremely important to my investigation... \nSTROMBOLI I\u00edll be the judge of that.  Anything else? \nBUMSTEAD Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me... \nSTROMBOLI O.S. (pokes head above desk) Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in cases right now  -  can\u00edt spare anyone. \nStromboli becomes distracted again  -  stands up, looks behind pictures hanging off the walls.  A big sign suspended above his desk says, SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME  -  his motto. \nBUMSTEAD Lost something? \nSTROMBOLI What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead... \nThe door clicks shut.  Stromboli looks up  -  the inspector has gone. \nEXT.  PLAZA  -  NIGHT \nWhite walks under stone archways. \nAcross an empty plaza is a sign above a door:   DRUGS OPEN 24 HOURS and in smaller print, recently added beneath:   SHAVE & HAIRCUT $5.00. \nINT.  DRUG STORE  -  NIGHT \nWhite walks between bare, dusty shelves.  Only one shelf carries products  -  BOX AFTER BOX OF \"LUMP-O\".  He moves up to a small counter.  A man with thick glasses, dressed like a BARBER, is seated there. \nWHITE I need something to keep me awake. \nBARBER Looks like you need a haircut to me. \nWHITE Thanks.  Just some pills. \nBARBER Only two bucks.  Shave as well... \nWHITE (annoyed now) Your sign says you sell drugs  - well, I\u00edm here to buy some.  Okay? \nBARBER Relax.  Sure! \nHe waves dramatically to a shelf above his head, with several bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules. \nBARBER Tell you what  -  let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Can\u00edt argue at that! \nWHITE (evenly) I don\u00edt want a haircut. \nLATER \nCAMERA TRACKS OFF a clock on a wall  -  REVEALS WHITE in a barber chair.  The BARBER gleefully works on WHITE\u00eds hair.  A thin OLD GUY in a moth-eaten suit steps from behind a curtain, smiles, playing a violin.  He\u00eds passionate but bad. \nBARBER (talks fast) Cut hair when I was in the navy, y\u00edknow  -  haven\u00edt lost the touch. Bet you\u00edre happy \u00ebbout that.  Huh! \nWHITE Sell maps? \nBARBER What of? \nWHITE The city.  I need to get to the ocean. \nWhite ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the congregation.  He motions to them to keep quiet.  He runs into the legs of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN the priest pointed out.  She is startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles. \nPRIEST (continues sermon) Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to hide in our hearts.  Have you not evil within you now? \nWhite sees a nearby CONFESSION BOX.  Staying low, he runs, almost knocks over a large illuminated candle-holder, darts inside.  The girl watches him. \nA GAUNT-FACED WOMAN stands.  Hysterical.  She looks at the priest. \nGAUNT WOMAN He took my little boy!  I\u00edll rip out his eyes! \nINSIDE  -  White breaths relief. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  carved on the dark stained wood in front of him is a crucified insect.  A voice surprises him.  Another PRIEST, OLDER. \nOLDER PRIEST You have sinned? \nWHITE NO.  Ah... \nWhite watches the two Mystery Men walk past, through the ornate wooden grill in front of his face. \nPRIEST I am listening. \nWHITE (lying) There\u00eds a...  woman.  I don't know but I think I, ahh... \nPRIEST You fornicated? \nThe Mystery Men look towards the box for a moment, towards White, but keep walking. \nWHITE No.  I, ah... \nPRIEST You seem restless. \nThe Mystery Men seem to have gone.  White takes out the gun, keeping it hidden from the priest.  Opens the chamber. \nTIGHT ON THE GUN  -  Only ONE BULLET left. \nWHITE Someone\u00eds after me. \nPRIEST Then we must call the police. \nWHITE No.  I mean...  that isn\u00edt necessary. \nThe silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward. \nPRIEST I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed? \nWHITE Just let me sit here for a moment? I\u00edll go soon, and stop bothering you. \nThe priest suddenly stares incredulously at White.  His eyes widen in horror. \nPRIEST You\u00edre the murderer? (starts to yell) Yes!  That must be it!  Don\u00edt kill me! \nWhite lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other over his mouth.  The old man stares at him, trembling uncontrollably. \nWHITE Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly. (holds up gun) Understand? \nThe priest nods stupidly.  White pushes him out of the confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his back.  Together they head for the doors.  Still no sign of the Mystery Men. \nPRIEST Don\u00edt kill me! \nWHITE Shut up! \nPRIEST Please... \nWhite loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently. \nWHITE (not so quietly) I\u00edm not going to kill you, okay! \nFaces turn. \nThe priest kicks White in the leg, bites his hand.  While White is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away. \nPRIEST (shouting/pointing) CRIMINAL! \nPeople start to scream and run.  The GAUNT WOMAN points at White. \nGAUNT WOMAN (screams insanely) It\u00eds him!  Rip out his eyes! \nFrightened, White holds the gun out.  Everyone panics, scatters.  People run for the exit.  Religious statues topple and smash.  The gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor, trampled by the crowd. \nAmidst the chaos, the two MYSTERY MEN appear across the room, see White, head towards him.  He turns and runs. \nA STAIRCASE \nWhite climbs narrow stairs rapidly. \nINT.  BELL TOWER \nWhite stops, nowhere left to go, just a long drop to the street through a series of arched windows.  A low, raftered room, three huge black BELLS. \nSuddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to swing, build momentum. \nCLANG!  CLA-A-A-ANG!  A cacophony of noise. \nWhite puts his hands over his ears in pain, then turns to the stairs. \nWithout removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby cop. \nBUMSTEAD I want prints over here... \nSuddenly the door has caught Bumstead\u00eds head in it.  He struggles.  The cop and the photographer run over to help. \nEXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT \nMOVE IN ON a doorway.  Above it a small illuminated red sign: \nDOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D. \nREVERSE ANGLE ON WHITE \nHe stands on the street, under the sign, rummaging in his wallet, obviously looking for the business card he doesn\u00edt have anymore. \nINT.  WAITING ROOM \nA white room, bare.  Dirt stains the walls near the air-vents. A NURSE is typing behind her desk. \nA THUMPING fills the room.  The nurse stands, removes her shoe and hits a pipe running along the wall several times.  The noise stops. \nThe front door creaks open and White enters.  She watches him step into the room. \nWHITE I want to see the doctor.  It's important. \nNURSE What time was your appointment? \nWHITE (angry) Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now. \nHe's leaning across her desk threateningly. \nNURSE (scared/standing) Yes, certainly...  Who should I say? \nWHITE No idea.  Just get him... \nSuddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of papers, steps out.  He freezes, stares at White.  The papers fall from his hands to the floor. \nINT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT \nA group of DARK SILHOUETTES file into a concrete room. \nThe MYSTERY MEN have gathered.  Like the Men who pursue White, they wear coats, leather gloves, dark glasses, and have near white skin. \nOne MAN points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the peculiar foreign tongue. \nTIGHT ON THE DIAGRAM  -  a path through the city.  A circle marks the point where the red line ends  -  a cathedral.  The Man goes into broken English  -  a guttural accent. \nMAN 1 It has failed. \nANOTHER MAN stands at the rear of the room. \nMAN 2 This is becoming dangerous, yes! \nYET ANOTHER MAN starts to tremble violently, seized with some kind of convulsion.  He froths at the mouth and throws his head about.  A TALLER MAN standing beside him opens a silver box, removes a small WRITHING WORM.  He places this on the tip of the trembling Man's tongue, who swallows it and calms down. \nMAN 3 Let's get this over with. \nANOTHER MAN rises suddenly, pushes forcefully to the front of the group. \nMAN 5 What about the dance-steps!  This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes? \nTHE MEN turn to face him.  He is out of line.  He becomes irritated, as if to say something further, then pulls himself short, sits down. \nMAN 5 Sorry. \nMAN 3 The situation has changed. (pacing the room) This one is in possession of knowledge... \nMAN 1 (cuts in) ...to avoid influence, yes. \nMAN 4 A freak! \nMAN 1 Impossible! \nRUMBLING NOISE O.S. attracts everyone's attention.  They all look to a round portal high on a wall.  The noise is louder. several figures on stilts run past outside the opening  -  then the noise subsides.  The MYSTERY MEN go back to more important things. \nMAN 3 It gets interesting, yes. \nMAN 2 Stop this!  It has gone too far! Tell Mister Black! \nMan 2 stares blankly into space, he makes a peculiar clicking noise with his mouth, his eyes roll upwards. \nINT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE \nTHE CAMERA GLIDES down a corridor, towards a door  -  a sign says, DOCTOR IS:  IN. \nINSIDE \nWhite sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden desk.  THE DOCTOR paces up and down in front of glass jars containing preserved specimens.  He stops, looks at White. \nSCHREBER You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done? \nWHITE You know something about me? \nSCHREBER Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? (smiles) Is there nothing you remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try. \nTHE DOORS ARE OPENED \nThey step into a room of living animal experiments. \nSCHREBER We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting. \nWHITE I'm nothing then. \nSCHREBER Anything but, my friend. \nThe two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements. \nSCHREBER It feels no pain. \nWhite turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly follows. \nWHITE Can I get my life back? \nSCHREBER Maybe. \nSchreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats. \nSCHREBER We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory. \nThe rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow raised. \nSCHREBER And then there is procedural memory. \nTIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device. One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two. \nSCHREBER Follow? \nWhite nods. \nSCHREBER Research on simple animals can be... useful.  To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example.  I am building an experiment with hamsters next. (looks at nearby cage of hamsters) Cute little things. \nSchreber puts a hand on White's shoulder. \nSCHREBER Listen to me talk!  You must be hungry. \nWhite nods again, extremely troubled. \nINT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE) \nSchreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark hall by Schreber, clutching a candle. \nSCHREBER Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are. \nThey've stopped outside a flaking door. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nA small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish. \nSCHREBER Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just how I like 'em! \nANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts to sizzle furiously. \nANGLE ON WHITE \nWHITE I'm sorry.  About before. \nSCHREBER I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help. \nA set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open slightly and THE NURSE looks in. \nNURSE (to Schreber) I have to talk to you. \nSCHREBER It can't wait? \nShe shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out again. \nSCHREBER  (to White) Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at home. \nHe leaves. \nAlone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens. The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully. \nWHITE Still kicking, huh? \nHe puts it back in his pocket. \nThe OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan. The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down. \nHe notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps across, looks through. \nTIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole. \nHIS P.O.V. \nA dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and whispering voices. \nWhite's eyes start to blur, he rubs them. \nSCHREBER O.S. How are things in here? \nBUMSTEAD Hold it! \nSchreber and White FREEZE in mid-struggle, look at the inspector.  Behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway. \nBUMSTEAD Police.  Nobody move. \nSCHREBER He tried to kill me! \nBUMSTEAD Shut up!  Everybody stay calm... \nBumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in White's face, handcuffs him.  Bumstead searches White, finds the revolver, takes this.  Also takes his wallet.  He glances at the doctor, who hides the syringe behind his back. \nBUMSTEAD (to Doctor) You Schreber? \nSchreber nods blankly. \nBumstead runs his hand over White's side pocket  -  feels something. \nBUMSTEAD What's that? \nWhite says nothing.  The inspector opens the pocket and looks in. \nBUMSTEAD (disgusted) A fish, huh? \nEXT.  CITY STREETS  -  NIGHT \nAn old-fashioned BLACK SEDAN drives over a rusty suspension bridge.  Stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle.  It's been raining.  Streets are empty. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nWHITE and the INSPECTOR drive silently.  Bumstead has appointed his un-marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home. Hot thermos.  Note pad holder, complete with light.  Coat hanger.  Gun rack.  A system for everything. \nBUMSTEAD Dammit! (glances at his watch) I'm curious?  How many so far? \nHe shakes his watch, puts it to his ear. \nWHITE (confused) What?  I... \nBUMSTEAD (counts on fingers) Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs.  And the young boy? \nWHITE (disturbed) Young boy? \nCLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now. \nBUMSTEAD The six year old.  Sure, you remember. \nBumstead pulls something from under the dashboard.  A SANDWICH, carefully wrapped and prepared.  After glancing at his watch again, he bites into it. \nBUMSTEAD (chewing) Y'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces. Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing. \nNo answer. \nBUMSTEAD You sure have demonstrated a great deal of...  imagination.  The baby was the best though.  Several cops lost their lunch over that one.  Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech... \nWHITE (cuts in) Stop it.  You're making me sick... \nBUMSTEAD We count seven so far.  Anyone we missed? \nRADIO CRACKLE O.S.  -  A tinny voice cuts in. \nVOICE Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector... \nBumstead picks up a microphone, speaks into it. \nBUMSTEAD What is it, Crenshaw? \nCRENSHAW Just reminding you...  your eight pee em... \nBUMSTEAD Dammit. (looks at watch) Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch.  It needs fixing. \nCRENSHAW Yes sir. \nBumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard, takes a SHARP CORNER as he finishes off the sandwich. \nWHITE Where are we going? \nBUMSTEAD Shut-up. \nBurastead pulls out a small brush, cleans the fallen crumbs from his trousers, keeping a hand on the wheel. \nWhite is silent  -  his wounds continue to bother him.  He leans down to scratch through his trousers. \nWHITE (quietly) Shit! \nBUMSTEAD Gesundheit! \nWHITE (looks up) I didn't sneeze. \nEXT.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE  -  NIGHT \nThe INSPECTOR's car pulls up and stops. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nWHITE What are we doing here? \nSTROMBOLI John... \nHe throws the first shot down on the table in front of White. A black and white police photo of a murder victim. \nSTROMBOLI ...Murderer. \nAnother photo goes down.  Another victim.  Another and another. Each more grisly than the last. \nSTROMBOLI You'll sign a confession? \nWhite nods.  He's looks utterly lost. \nBumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near the only door, presses a button. \nBUMSTEAD (into speaker) Okay. \nTWO GUARDS immediately step through the door, GRAB White by his arms.  They carry him off. \nINT.  PRISON CELL \nWhite is woken by a UNIFORMED GUARD shining a light in his eyes. \nGUARD Visitor. \nINT.  VISITING ROOM \nWhite is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier down the middle.  The guard tells him to sit and wait. \nThe door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  - DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened. \nWHITE  (to guard) Keep him away:  He's insane. \nThe guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly. \nSCHREBER Please, stay calm. \nWHITE  (to guard) This man wants to kill me. \nThe guard remains indifferent. \nSCHREBER  (to guard) Just one of his many delusions  - it's nothing. (a whisper to White) Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't get another chance like this.  Listen to me. \nWHITE  (turns to Doctor) What do you want? \nSCHREBER You're innocent... (still a whisper) You didn't kill anyone. \nWHITE  (sarcastic) What am I doing in here then? \nSCHREBER Listen to what I have to say.  Decide for yourself. \nAN ADJOINING ROOM \nThe dark silhouettes of BUMSTEAD and ANOTHER COP watch from behind a two-way mirror. \nBUMSTEAD What's he doing here? \nCOP Says he is the man's doctor... (taps side of his head) You know... \nBUMSTEAD I know it's his doctor... (into intercom) I need the file on.. (reads clip-board) Daniel Paul Schreber M.D. \nMISS CRENSHAW'S VOICE O.S. Schreber.  Yes.  Isn't that his doctor? \nBUMSTEAD (evenly) Yes. (beat) And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'. \nMISS CRENSHAW Yes.  An \"h\". \nThe inspector looks up from the speaker. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE MIRROR, White seems to have calmed down. \nBACK IN THE VISITING ROOM \nSCHREBER The men in black  -  they're the killers. \nWhite stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass. \nWHITE You're a liar! \nSCHREBER No, it's the truth. \nWHITE So you're telling me the truth this time?  Is that it! \nThe doctor removes a SMALL SYRINGE from his black bag, places it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the guard's view. \nSCHREBER If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer. \nWHITE Not that again... \nSCHREBER Everyone get's one  -  very much like this... (points to syringe) But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything... \nWHITE (cuts in) I'm not injecting anything into my brain. \nSCHREBER Anton  -  I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a lie from the beginning.  It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have.  You have been left  - blank. \nSchreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him. \nBUMSTEAD This is highly irregular.  I have a right to know. \nMAN 1 We are from a mental asylum. \nHe notices that this man's moustache is LOP-SIDED.  The other man wears spectacles WITH NO LENSES in the frames, clutches an un-lit pipe in his teeth. \nSTROMBOLI Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help. \nBUMSTEAD I see... \nMAN 1 Yes, Inspector.  Has he been displaying any strange...  behaviour? \nBUMSTEAD He's been a little angel... \nSTROMBOLI If you could show them to the holding cell now. \nSLOW MOVE IN on Bumstead's face. \nIN THE CORRIDOR \nBumstead and the MYSTERY MEN walk towards the holding cell. Bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he enters.  IT'S EMPTY. \nHe fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket  -  BURSTS into the room.  White is gone.  But where?  Bumstead throws a look back TO THE FRONT DESK. \nMAN 1 Where is he? \nThe cop is just returning, holding a cup of coffee.  He looks at the inspector, sees the room is empty.  A nervous twitch knocks the cup from the cop's hands. \nTIGHT ON THE CUP  -  smashing on the floor. \nINT.  SUBWAY STATION  -  NIGHT \nUnderground.  CONSTANT NOISE O.S. of trains arriving and departing but none are seen. \nCAMERA MOVES PAST broken tiles on a wall to REVEAL:  WHITE  - sitting amidst rubbish on the ground, looking around, confused, groggy from sleep.  He looks down at his hands, unsuccessfully tries to free them from the cuffs. \nMOVE IN TIGHT ON WHITE \nHe starts to cry.  He puts his head in his hands, his body spasms with each sob. \nSEVERAL ANGLES of the empty corridors of the subway.  White's crying is heard  -  echoic. \nBACK ON WHITE  -  A small feminine HAND touches his head. \nStartled, he throws himself back, like he's about to be attacked. \nTHE BEAUTIFUL JAPANESE WOMAN from the church looks down at him. \nINT.  POLICE STATION \nBUMSTEAD and the COP are getting grilled by STROMBOLI. \nBUMSTEAD Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed... \nSTROMBOLI (shouts at cringing COP) How could you have been so stupid? \nCOP I'm sorry, sir. \nSTROMBOLI Alright, get out. \nBumstead gets up and leaves. \nSTROMBOLI You stay. \nThe cop hustles out, shuts the door. \nSTROMBOLI Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that. \nBUMSTEAD Yes, sir. \nHe leaves. \nINT.  APARTMENT BUILDING \nWhite, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat, follows the JAPANESE WOMAN up a flight of dark stairs.  she keeps looking back at him, smiling but SAYS NOTHING. \nINT.  APARTMENT \nWhite and the woman step into a run-down apartment.  She points to a couch.  White looks uncomfortable.  She smiles again, then turns on the radio.  MUSIC. \nShe steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving White alone.  He gets up and starts to tune the radio.  A babble of fragments of voices and music, then:  A NEWS REPORT... \nNEWS READER O.S. ...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended. \nWhite listens nervously. \nNEWS READER O.S. ...and now for a message from LUMP-O food products... \nAcross the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar.  He crosses to the doorway and looks in.  The woman stands naked against a deep red wall, her back turned.  She has an elaborate TATTOO on her back  -  looks like an INSECT.  She puts on a dressing gown and TURNS SUDDENLY. \nWhite steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the couch. \nShe steps from the doorway holding a BAR OF SOAP in her hand. She sits down beside White and takes his hands, gently lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at him.  White looks down. \nHis hands seem to have SHRUNK  -  they poke out of his sleeves like tiny children's limbs.  The cuffs effortlessly slip off. \nThe CAMERA MOVES past flaking bricks  -  to a window.  Behind the glass WHITE and SACHIKO sit across from the WOMAN who attacked White.  She is talking, though nothing can be heard, drying her eyes with a handkerchief. \nINSIDE \nThe strange woman looks at White intently between sobs. \nWOMAN Please believe me.  It's me, John. Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you -  now you want to just send me away again... \nWhite looks AT THE FLOOR. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  a crack in the floorboards  -  movement underneath. \nWHITE I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life... \nWIFE It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent. \nWHITE How do you know I'm innocent? \nWIFE Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then... \nWHITE I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them? \nWIFE They're dead, John. \nHe stands and walks to the window  -  looks out at the city. \nWIFE You have an uncle.  You were very close. \nShe fumbles in her handbag, pulls out a notebook, scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to White. \nWIFE This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you. \nWHITE (taking paper) Thanks. \nWIFE (looks at him for a beat) Don't you want me?   My body? Remember how my skin feels?  Touch it.  I... \nShe notices Sachiko  -  becomes self-conscious.  Sachiko silently stands and leaves the room.  The wife puts her face in her hands, overcome with tears. \nWHITE What's your name? \nWIFE  (looks up  -  still sobbing) Elizabeth. \nWhite removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his wallet, holds the black and white eye up to her face  -  it matches. \nWHITE  (thoughtful) Yes... \nIn the darkness of a doorway Sachiko watches the couple.  She MOVES OFF. \nELIZABETH I want to help... \nWHITE Alright.  Here... \nHe pulls the postcard from his wallet, holds it up so the woman can see it. \nWHITE Know this place? \nShe looks at the card. \nELIZABETH  (stops crying) Of course.  Your home town  -  where you grew up... \nWhite stands abruptly, startling the woman.  He glares down at her intensely. \nWHITE How do I get there?  Tell me. \nWIFE That's easy.  You... \nShe trails off into silence.  Her hand, about to point in a certain direction, freezes in mid-air. \nELIZABETH ...strange, I forgot. \nWhite sits back down quietly. \nWHITE Yes.  Very strange. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nSachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of the room, lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor. \nUnderneath is a TRAP-DOOR.  Opening it, she climbs down a hole. \nUNDER THE FLOOR \nIn the semi-darkness she moves to a WOODEN BOX.  She cranks a small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open.  Music plays softly. \nShe looks into the yawning black mouth of the box.  A WORM-LIKE apparition threads its way out of the hole, wraps about her thigh.  She breaths deeply, shuts her eyes. \nINT.  TENEMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR \nLOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  -  feet walk along a tattered rug, approach a door.  Bumstead's shoes, shiny as always. \nINT.  TENEMENT ROOM \nA KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket, sitting before a small t.v. set.  This is THOMPSON  -  the detective with mental problems.  He's unshaven, haunted. \nClutching a shotgun, he steps to the door, peeks through a spy- hole. \nWith this, she starts to cry again. \nSachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses Elizabeth's lips. \nINT.  DARK CHAMBER  -  NIGHT \nTIGHT ON TWO MYSTERY MEN speaking in whispers.  The Men continue talking as THE CAMERA RISES, through several levels of concrete and machinery TO REVEAL: \nEXT.  ROOF-TOP  -  NIGHT \nOTHER MYSTERY MEN are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna device. \nBACK DOWN IN THE DARK CHAMBER \nThe group of MYSTERY MEN have gathered once again.  One addresses them all. \nMYSTERY MAN The line of junction between two edges! \nMEN  (unison) YES! \nMYSTERY MAN We have located him.  Now is the time, yes. \nA switch is thrown.  Electricity sparks to life.  A hum is in the air. \nMYSTERY MAN Let the tuning commence! \nThe congregation of MEN place ELECTRODES to their foreheads in a trance-like manner.  They chant, quietly at first, steadily building in volume.  The MEN stand and MOVE RHYTHMICALLY to some inner beat. \nThe CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to a diagram pinned on a board.  A representation of a man's legs.  Trousers rolled up above the knees, showing a number of bite-like wounds on the flesh. Labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion -  the legends are an unknown language. \nON THE ROOF \nThe antenna glows with a ghostly green light.  O.S. SCREAMS RISE UP FROM THE STREET. \nINT.  APARTMENT/KITCHEN  -  LATER \nWhite downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the window.  O.S. distant screams. \nHe glances across to a wall, notices A FLY there  -  something about it looks WRONG. \nFLY'S P.O.V. \nA distorted electronic image of White's FACE looming up. \nAt exactly that moment the FLY TAKES OFF, flies erratically down the hall, around a turn and disappears.  White follows. \nHALL-WAY \nWhite moves quietly towards the bedroom door. \nHIS P.O.V. \nIt is ajar, dark inside.  Movement.  The women are naked on the bed.  The JAPANESE WOMAN has her eyes shut, head back in ecstasy. The WIFE is bent over her, kissing her stomach. \nANGLE ON WHITE  -  watching through the crack in the door.  The women are oblivious. \nHe moves away slowly, feeling strange.  His feet stop making contact with the floor.  He grabs a table to steady himself. The table-cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and smash. He's FLOATING. \nWhite desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the light-fixture in the ceiling.  It breaks off in a cloud of plaster.  Sparks briefly illuminate.  He falls heavily ONTO THE CEILING  -  now the floor.  The apartment is upside down. \nHe stares up at furniture and objects. \nTHE BATHROOM \nWhite steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor.  Water is running  -  filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above White's head. \nWhite takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor.  It's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off. Pulls himself towards the tub. \nGravity becomes NORMAL AGAIN as he sinks in the warm water. He's incredibly weak  -  floats limply in the bath.  Submerges his face.  A distant throbbing O.S., like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building. \nHe opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling. \nHIS P.O.V. \nA blurry DARK FIGURE moves into his vision.  It stares down at him. \nWhite rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water.  The FIGURE reaches out.  A GLOVED HAND grabs White about the throat, holds him forcefully.  White gulps for air, swallows water.  His eyes widen.  He tries to stop the hand strangling him but can't. \nSuddenly the hand pulls away.  The BLURRY FIGURE stumbles back and ERUPTS into bloody explosion.  The body splits apart, throwing internal organs through the room. \nWhite awakens in the bathtub.  He looks about the room.  Empty. Silent.  He gets out of the water, starts to dress. \nEXT.  BUILDING \nBUMSTEAD'S car pulls up.  He gets out, stained here and there with bile. \nINT.  APARTMENT \nA HIGH ANGLE on the slain bodies of the JAPANESE WOMAN and WHITE'S WIFE.  TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing stuff.  Bumstead walks up to the cop in charge. \nCOP All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him. (indicates Sachiko's corpse) She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute. \nBUMSTEAD The other one? \nCOP His wife. \nINT.  BUMSTEAD'S OFFICE \nBUMSTEAD enters.  He looks nervous.  His SECRETARY sits at her desk in an adjoining office, filing her nails. \nBUMSTEAD I need everything on the Jonathan White case. \nMISS CRENSHAW Yes, sir.  Everything? \nBUMSTEAD All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me. \nThe inspector turns to face her, a little manic. She is staring at him. \nBUMSTEAD Please  -  I'm in a hurry. \nMISS CRENSHAW (evenly) Certainly. \nEXT.  POLICE STATION \nBUMSTEAD steps from the doorway and walks across to his car briskly. \nINT.  BATH-HOUSE \nBumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels and swimming outfits, waiting silently.  They sit lined by a wall, staring into space. \nBumstead walks into a larger tiled room, full of steam.  He walks beside a heated pool  -  naked people swim about weakly or sit on the edge washing themselves.  He steps up to A FULLY DRESSED MAN, sitting silently on a bench.  It is WHITE. \nA feint smile brushes across White's lips as he looks up at the inspector.  He looks away, like he's forgotten something. Stands, walks over to the pool, cups his hand, bends down, scoops some water. \nBumstead sees White has picked up the LITTLE SILVER FISH. \nBUMSTEAD Why give yourself up? \nWHITE I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something... (beat) I'm scared. \nBUMSTEAD That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that? \nWHITE I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there. \nBUMSTEAD  (not convinced) Uh-huh. (pauses) What are you scared of? \nWHITE People...  after me. \nBUMSTEAD Who? \nWHITE I don't know who they are. \nBUMSTEAD Why are they after you? \nWHITE Don't know that either. \nBUMSTEAD Don't know much, do you? \nINT.  LABORATORY  -  NIGHT \nMetal scraping. \nPIANO ACCORDION MUSIC wafts on a breeze, someone breathing. \nHIGH ANGLE  -  Down through an OPENING metal hatch.  A dim laboratory IS REVEALED  -  a maze of scientific instruments. Elongated shadows move about. \nMYSTERY MEN are hunched over something.  Behind them a diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain. \nMAN 1 bends across to a CONTROL PANEL, works a switch.  A small speaker in a metal box crackles to life.  SOUND OF DISTANT SURF.  A WOMAN'S VOICE: \nVOICE What is your name...  What is your name... \nWires lead from the metal box to a HUMAN BRAIN within a metallic container.  Electricity arches across electrodes. \nMore sounds from the speaker:  WATER BUBBLING.  HIGH HEELS WALK DOWN STAIRS.  BED-SPRINGS.  LOVERS MOAN PASSIONATELY. \nMAN 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their handiwork. \nA PUPPET-LIKE CREATURE is revealed.  Small  -  two and half feet tall.  The top of its head an open hatch containing the BRAIN.  Wires lead to this. \nTIGHT ON PUPPET'S EYES  -  They glance about the room. Its body is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces. \nMAN 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes. \nINSIDE ITS HEAD \nGears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light.  The gears part slowly to reveal a small writhing INSECT screwed to a metal plate. \nMAN 2 shows the puppet PHOTOGRAPHS:  WHITE as he looks currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby. Photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a seaside pier sirtiling and waving.  Where he went to school.  A red push-bike he owned as a boy.  His first sweetheart.  Then a photo of a young woman smiling  -  his WIFE. \nMAN 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the puppet creature  -  MORE SOUNDS OF SURF... \nA FIGURE clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows. His pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane  -  a carved silver insect.  It's MISTER BLACK.  Man 3 steps up to him. \nMISTER BLACK You have duplicated the personality, yes. \nMAN 3 It is ready.  The Doctor was most helpful. \nMister Black turns towards the OTHER MEN. \nMISTER BLACK I hear a clock in my head, and I like it! \nBUMSTEAD I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you.  It started with two little girls.  Twins.  Used to play with them when I was young.  Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why... \nHe looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint. \nBUMSTEAD They didn't have faces. \nWHITE What? \nBUMSTEAD That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. (looks back at White) That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject. \nHe glances at White, then back to the road. \nBUMSTEAD Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me... \nBumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then: \nBUMSTEAD Is there anything you haven't told me about this business?  Even the most insignificant thing? \nWHITE (thinking) No.  Nothing I can think of. Except... \nBUMSTEAD Go on. \nWHITE Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there. \nBUMSTEAD Why, that's ridiculous.  You just... \nHe trails off.  Shakes his head slowly. \nBUMSTEAD We'll get to the bottom of this.  I mean it. \nINT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY \nThe doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the doctor before he can protest. \nBUMSTEAD I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin... \nSCHREBER I don't know what you're talking about. \nBUMSTEAD That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time... \nSCHREBER You are mistaken. \nWHITE What are you hiding? \nSCHREBER Nothing.  I don't know anything! \nBUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face. \nSCHREBER Please, they'll kill me... \nBUMSTEAD I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends. \nEXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT \nSCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an alleyway. \nSchreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall. \nSCHREBER In there. \nBUMSTEAD Just like that? \nThe threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall. \nSchreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He waves the other men forward. \nWhite and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it. \nA CORRIDOR \nThrough the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button. Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open. \nThey step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends. \nBUMSTEAD What is this place? \nSCHREBER You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself. \nWhen the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK PASSAGEWAY. \nEXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT \nThe PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities. \nINT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD \nWHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has something written on it in a strange language. \nINSIDE IS A ROOM \nThey stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead turns to him. \nWHITE Look. \nWhite points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook carries A FACE. \nThe inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs White, holds him back. \nBUMSTEAD What the hell is that? \nAt the end of the alley the PUPPET advances menacingly. Schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and disappears. \nBUMSTEAD Quick.  My car. \nFortunately BUMSTEAD'S CAR stands nearby.  The two men leap in, start it up.  Bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the glare of the headlights. \nThe puppet's head opens, a TINY PROPELLER pops out, spins, lifting the puppet into the air.  The car passes beneath it at speed.  Screeches off into a street, races along between tall buildings. \nINSIDE THE CAR \nWHITE What now? \nBUMSTEAD This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be? \nWhite thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him from his pocket. \nWHITE I'll go see an uncle of mine. (reading) Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double six  -  three... \nBumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with the wheel, driving at breakneck speed. \nBUMSTEAD Good. (looks in rear mirror) Uh-oh... \nWhite turns and looks behind them. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  HEADLIGHTS gaining on them. \nON THE PUPPET  -  sitting AT THE WHEEL of a stolen car, driving like crazy. \nBACK IN BUMSTEAD'S CAR \nWhite takes out his gun  -  AIMS at the rapidly approaching car. \nWHITE  (remembers) It's empty. \nBUMSTEAD Take mine. \nBumstead pulls a gun out of his coat.  They swap. \nThe puppet PULLS ALONGSIDE, a mechanical arm extends towards Bumstead's front tire.  A SPINNING BLADE extends from the end of the mechanical arm. \nPUPPET ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA- HA!! \nTIGHT ON THE BLADE heading for the spinning wheel.  White fires.  Shells hit the PUPPET'S car, shattering windows. \nTHE BLADE cuts into the tire  -  it pops loudly, goes flat, metal SPARKS off the road. \nWhite is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash.  Bumstead fights to keep control, SWERVES into the side of the other vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans flying. \nThe PUPPET'S car falls behind  -  then swerves off into a side- street and disappears. \nBUMSTEAD  (looks behind him) Where did it go? \nWHITE  (looks back also) Don't know. \nBoth look FORWARD AGAIN  -  to see the PUPPET'S CAR pull out in front of them, BLOCKING THE WAY.  Bumstead's car is going too fast.  Slams the brakes. \nTIGHT ON PUPPET  -  Screaming with insane joy as Bumstead's car approaches like a bullet. \nINSIDE INSPECTOR'S CAR \nBUMSTEAD Jump! \nBumstead rips the phone number from the pad.  The two men LEAP. \nThe car continues onwards. \nCRASH!  KA-BOOM! \nIn the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves up from different sides of the street.  Look at each other, turn and head in OPPOSITE directions. \nCAMERA MOVES IN on mangled metal  -  a MECHANICAL CLAW starts to pull itself from the wreckage. \nEXT.  STREET  -  NIGHT \nWhite steps up to a SMALL DOOR in the side of a building.  A sign above the door depicts an underwater scene, crammed with fish, sea-weed, bubbles floating to the surface.  Dominating everything is a GREEN MAN with scales  -  a KING NEPTUNE-type. \nINSIDE \nWhite stops in front of a ticket booth, beside a faded blue curtain.  In the booth a TICKET SELLER is snoring with his mouth hanging open, his head sagging. White knocks on the window.  The man wakes with a start. \nTICKET SELLER Yeah.  That's what I said! (looks at White  - rubs head) What..? \nWHITE I'm looking for this address. \nThe man squints at the card White holds up, nods groggily. \nTICKET SELLER Upstairs.  Through there. \nHe thumbs the blue curtain.  Curls up, shuts his eyes again. \nBEYOND THE CURTAIN \nWhite paddles the boat to the bottom of A PIER, climbs a rotten ladder.  He runs off into the shadows. \nBACK IN THE WATER \nThe PUPPET cuts through the waves, pushed along by a rear propeller.  It reaches the pier, climbs to the top.  The prop retracts, and the creature wheels forward slowly, onto a concrete surface.  It looks around  -  it knows White is there somewhere. \nPUPPET'S P.O.V. \nA trail of WET FOOTPRINTS on the ground.  It follows them, is led to a crane cabin. \nINSIDE THE CRANE'S CABIN  -  is White, a lunatic grin on his face, at the controls. \nA NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.  It looks up. \nPUPPET'S P.O.V. \nFollows the crane up into the air.  The crane is swinging around against the dark sky.  A HUGE METAL CONTAINER dangles, stops above the puppet. \nON WHITE \nWHITE Nice knowing you. \nTIGHT ON WHITE'S HAND  -  It pulls a lever. \nTHE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall. \nTHE PUPPET  -  Screams up at the plummeting container. \nWIDER \nThe container crashes into the ground, crushing the creature. \nSilence.  Dust floats in the air. \nEXT.  STREET \nBUMSTEAD's running.  He looks a mess, clutching a bleeding gash in his side, cuts on his face, clothes torn  -  but he made it out alive... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROOF-TOP \nBUMSTEAD sits on the ground, leans against a wall, breathing heavily  -  he's losing a lot of blood. \nHe waits. \nA NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the roof. \nBUMSTEAD White? \nIt's too big to be White.  The man steps from the shadows. \nSTROMBOLI (walking forward) Hello, Bumstead. \nHe's holding a gun, levelled at the inspector.  Bumstead lies bleeding, against the wall.  He points his own gun at the advancing man and pulls the trigger. \nCLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK! \nBUMSTEAD Dammit. \nStromboli is upon him, grabs the empty gun, throws it away, picks up the inspector, leans him against the wall.  Without Stromboli holding him up, Bumstead would not be able to stand. \nSTROMBOLI Why do you always have to find things out the hard way!  Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot?  I told you, didn't I?  These people are not playing games, Bumstead.  They can do anything they want, don't you understand? \nBUMSTEAD (a hiss) You're one of them.  You bastard... \nSTROMBOLI (laughing) In a way, we all are, inspector! You.  Me.  Everybody! \nStromboli carries Bumstead towards the EDGE of the roof.  He keeps laughing. \nSTROMBOLI Time for that early retirement, Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid. \nBUMSTEAD (weakly) No...  Please... \nINSPECTOR'S P.O.V. \nTHE EDGE looms up  -  a long drop to the street. \nEXT.  STREET \nWhite paces nervously through empty streets.  He stops, to get his bearings, then turns and runs into: \nA SILHOUETTED FIGURE in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels. A skeletal hand reaches out to White, grabs his arm.  An inhuman moan. \nTerrorised, White pulls back. \nFIGURE Ahhh...  it hurts!... \nThe mechanized figure trundles forward, pins him to a wall.  A streetlight reveals... \nDOCTOR SCHREBER covered in blood, encased in a metal framework covered in silver blades. \nWHITE What happened to you? \nSCHREBER I'm...  being...  punished. \nMister Black looks up at White  -  angered. \nMISTER BLACK How dare you use your tricks on me! \nWhite, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men BACK AWAY from him, scared. \nWHITE I didn't realise... \nMISTER BLACK Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant. \nHe glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner starts to vibrate. \nCLOSE on Mister Black's eyes. \nThe chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White. \nMister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks just in time. \nThe gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause. \nWhite regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  - a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically. \nThis display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with his mind. \nSEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own performance. \nMISTER BLACK You'll regret that. \nMister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his mouth. \nMISTER BLACK (shouts) SHUT IT DOWN! \nA Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting. \nMAN ON PHONE Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it down immediately. \nWhite doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of machinery WINDING DOWN. \nANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It suddenly STOPS. \nAll eyes are on Mister Black. \nMISTER BLACK This has all gone too far.  Yes, much too far. \nMister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to the floor. \nAround the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the ceiling... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT \nAll over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating impact on the landscape. \nMONTAGE \nA street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus... \nA building vanishes... \nA car on a street corner flies into the air... \nA telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the hole left behind... \nGeysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky... \nBLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone steps... \nTHE CITY is coming apart... \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT H' \nThe room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and gaping holes torn in the walls. \nSeveral MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle. \nThe fighting is taken its toll on both men. \nA DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face White with its shining silver blade. \nMister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the knife. \nWhite, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind against the knife. \nThe blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his vision. \nHe is losing. \nINT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT \nWe see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD. \nFIGURE Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is easier now. \n", "test1_input": "INT.  CHINESE CAFE \nHe walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six tables.  Empty.  Dirty.  He sits and waits. \nA CLOCK ticks on the wall  -  midnight.  White coughs, for attention. \nA NOISE from a doorway.  A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks.  A SMALL ASIAN WOMAN appears and limps to his table.  She speaks very quickly IN CHINESE.  He does not understand. \nShe points to a chalk board on the wall  -  a list of dishes also in Chinese, only one in English  -  the last one.  At the bottom.  In small print.  \"NOODLES\". \nWHITE (nods) The noodles.  I\u00edll have some noodles. \nThe old woman rips a YELLOW TICKET from a pad, gives it to White.  A number on it.  She points her crooked finger again at a SPEAKER BOX above a small serving window in the wall.  A greenish fluoro pulses from the room within. \nWOMAN We call. \nShe leaves again. \nWhite looks about the empty room.  Insects are zapped on an illuminated DEVICE hanging on the wall.  An old air-conditioner RATTLES noisily. \nNOISES from the kitchen  -  voices argue in Chinese, a baby cries.  Then SILENCE. \nWhite removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table. \nHe overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.  Leans forward, hands trembling.  Without realising, he holds the paper OVER A CANDLE burning on the table.  The paper CATCHES FIRE, is engulfed.  He drops the flaming page on the table.  Now the table-cloth starts to burn. \nWhite is frantic.  On a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water, and dumps this on the flames.  It kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table-cloth.  The paper is ash. \nHe moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the smoke away. \nINT.  POLICE STATION  -  NIGHT \nBUMSTEAD is moving quickly.  He suddenly trips and falls to the floor.  He curses under his breath, then looks up. \nHIS P.O.V. \nA door  -  THOMPSON:  DETECTIVE/INSPECTOR on the frosted glass. Bumstead stands, pushes into the office. \nINSIDE \nA total mess  -  paperwork everywhere, dozens of used coffee cups, rotting food in greasy paper bags.  Bumstead shakes his head. \nBUMSTEAD A real shame... \nHe starts to look around. \nTIGHT ON FILING CABINET  -  a drawer is pulled open. Thompson\u00eds files are also a mess.  Bumstead continues to shake his head.  He reaches for a file.  A loud SNAP! \nBUMSTEAD (screams) YAAAAAAAAAH! \nHe recoils.  A mousetrap has snapped over his fingers.  He pulls it off his hand, throws it to the floor, cursing. \nINT.  CHINESE CAFE \nWhite is still waiting for his food. \nHe leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites  -  worse, inflamed.  He uses a napkin to wipe at the pus. \nAERIAL PERSPECTIVE OF A FLY  -  circling the room, looking down on White. \nON THE FLY  -  It lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table.  The creature is some kind of SURVEILLANCE DEVICE  -  half insect/half machine.  It\u00eds spying on him.  MOVE IN TIGHT as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head.  It shits on the food behind it. \nWhite is oblivious to this.  He\u00eds finished examining his leg, is sitting quietly.  He yawns.  His head nods forward briefly. \nA NOISE.  White looks up. \nA TRAP-DOOR has opened in the ceiling.  Two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole.  A sea breeze blows through the room.  The SOUND OF SURF, SEAGULLS CRYING. \nON White\u00eds nose twitching.  He can smell the ocean. \nThe WALLPAPER COMES ALIVE  -  like a seething tangle of worms. \nOne by one, THREE MEN in black coats lower into the room, floating on air.  They pull out knifes, step forward. \nON WHITE rigid with terror. \nON THE MEN  -  though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom, they too resemble the MAN who confronted White earlier. They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads. Ready to attack.  They lean over him, pause dramatically. \nMAN 1 Don\u00edt fall asleep. (chuckles softly) Might never wake, yes. \nThis Man turns to the others.  They all smile, then turn back to White. \nMEN (in unison) Fifty-six. \nANOTHER VOICE has been speaking softly  -  now it is louder. Repeating: \nVOICE Fifty-six...  Fifty-six... \nANGLE  -  a chair falls to the floor. \nWhite leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented.  Just a DREAM  -  he had dozed. \nWIDEN ANGLE  -  The place is still empty.  White glances to the serving window.  A DISH waits for him, framed in the glowing fluoro square.  He gets it.  A bowl of soupy liquid with noodles.  He sits down. \nHe is about to start eating  -  realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon.  Picking up the bowl again, he heads to the kitchen. \n", "test1_true": "He takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds himself in another corridor.  He looks about, unsure which direction to go in. \nINT.  SERIES OF ROOMS  -  LATER \nWhite is lost, still holding the soup. \nHe moves through a number of RUSTED METAL DOORS that open and shut automatically.  Each reveals another room or corridor. Deserted spaces long forgotten  -  dusty, crumbling. \nHe feels the fish moving about in his pocket, pulls it out and looks at it. \nWhite holds the dying fish in one hand, the bowl of cold soup in the other.  Disgusted, he puts the fish into the bowl. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nA TICKING SOUND O.S. \nWhite stops.  Looks up.  A large clock suspended from the rafters.  A tug at his coat. \nStanding beside him is FREDRICK  -  the little man from White\u00eds hotel room. \nFREDRICK (stutters) Where have you been?  The doctor\u00eds been worried about you. \nWHITE What?  Who are you? \nFredrick looks nervously down the corridor. \nFREDRICK C\u00edmon, let\u00eds go!  We don\u00edt have any time. \nThe little man grabs White\u00eds sleeve, starts to pull him along. \nWHITE Hold it a minute.  Let\u00eds start at the beginning, huh? \nANGLE ON  -  the top of a set of stairs in front of them.  Two dark figures appear. \nFredrick looks up at them in horror. \nFRERICK Shit! (looks at White) Quick!  Run! \nBoth men run like crazy, White awkwardly holding the bowl of soup.  They come to a junction, each takes a separate corridor. Fredrick finds some stairs, climbs two at a time. \nWhite climbs INTO FRAME, looks around, finds another corridor. The little man is nowhere to be seen.  White reaches another junction  -  several corridors branch off. \nHIS P.O.V. PANNING AROUND \nEach passageway completely deserted. \nWHITE Shit. \nHe keeps running. \nINT.  HOTEL LOBBY \nA PHOTO FLASH  -  illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager, slumped in his own blood. \nBumstead leans INTO FRAME, examines the corpse.  He notices several stab wounds in the man\u00eds abdomen.  Various cops search the room. \nOne cop walks up to the Inspector. \nCOP We got another one upstairs \nBUMSTEAD (deadpan) Great. \nINT.  ROOM  -  NIGHT \nA SMALL ROOM with arched windows that look over the city. Fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned table. \nHe scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then puts it into a METAL CYLINDER he finds beneath the table also. \nHe glances out a window, notices A FIGURE standing beneath a street-lamp below, looking up at him.  Startled, Fredrick darts back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical PIPES running up into the ceiling. \nTIGHT ON ONE OF THE PIPES  -  he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it.  The cylinder is snatched from his hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air. \nWIDER \nFredrick steps back, a sigh of relief.  A shadow falls across his back.  He turns.  He screams. \nINT./EXT.  VARIOUS \nTIGHT  -  rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding speed.  The cylinder races around corners.  It clanks and grinds.  HURTLES up the side of a building.  THEN PLUMMETS underground.  Rushes through darkness. \nEXT.  BRIDGE  -  NIGHT \nTHE CAMERA MOVES along a bridge-like structure.  An enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons.  Under the bridge, pipes spew sewage into stagnant water. \nANGLE ON WHITE WALKING  -  seen through a series of illuminated, dirty, windows.  He occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him. \nINSIDE \nTIGHT ON the fish swimming weakly in the soup. \nANGLE ON WHITE  -  He stops, looks up at O.S. SOUND of clattering metal.  A pipe runs the length of the corridor  - the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness. \nThen the silence is shattered by a piercing series of SCREAMS somewhere in the building.  White hurriedly moves towards the source. \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \n", "test1_id": 2199, "test2_input": "WHITE Where does it lead? \nKARL It must be a closet or something. \nWhite pushes at the cabinet.  The old man helps.  They only manage to push several inches  -  it is very heavy.  White decides to just climb over it.  He squeezes through, opens the door and climbs a set of dark stairs.  Uncle Karl watches. \nKARL Don't trip over.  It's dark up there. \nINT.  ATTIC  -  NIGHT \nTIGHT ON a light switch  -  it is flipped. \nAN ATTIC  -  full of books, boxes, discarded possessions. White picks up a book and opens it  -  the pages have been eaten out by a swarm of ROACHES.  He drops it in disgust as the insects scurry over his hands. \nIn a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great interest.  At the bottom of the box he finds a SMALL DOG-EARED DRAWING BOOK.  On the cover is a colourful scrawl in child's writing  -  a title:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE. \nWhite sits down and flips through the book in the dim light. Page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings. As he reads segments from the book he seems more and more disturbed.  He flips through faster and faster. \nHIS P.O.V. \nPages flip past, stopping occasionally.  Glimpses of DIAGRAMS. The MYSTERY MEN and THEIR WORLD.  Cross-sections of the MYSTERY MEN, the cavity in their head with the INSECTS INSIDE clearly illustrated.  EVERYTHING. \nPUSH IN CLOSE on White.  He looks up, STUNNED. \nINT.  UNCLE KARL'S APARTMENT \nWhite emerges from the attic, clutching the small book to his chest, lost in thought.  He steps quietly into a hall-way  - notices the old man putting THE PHONE back on its cradle. \nKARL John, I didn't see you there. \nA NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.  A VENTILATION GRILL falls off a wall, revealing a hole.  EYES shine from the darkness. \nTHE PUPPET leaps from the hole.  Its blades unfolding, spinning wildly before it hits the carpet.  It faces the two men. \nKARL What is that? \nWHITE (to Karl) Get back! \nKARL Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo! \nHe wheels forward, attempting to scare the puppet off. \nWHITE No! \nThe puppet goes for Uncle Karl.  A whirr of metal, BLOOD SPLASHES ACROSS WHITE and the walls.  Uncle Karl SCREAMS horribly. \nWhite grabs a chair  -  holds it above him.  The puppet turns from the dead man in the wheelchair.  White lets it have it. The chair CRASHES DOWN, splintering into pieces. \nThe puppet is dazed, but immediately recovers.  White has a fire-poker now.  As the puppet advances, he swings, connecting with the creature, hurtling it across the room, into a wall. White runs out the door. \nIN THE CORRIDOR \nHe leaps into a waiting elevator.  Pushes the top floor button. \nTHE ELEVATOR SHAFT  -  The elevator moves upwards. \nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR \nWhite looks through the circular window in the door. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  Floor after floor SLIDES PAST  -  deserted.  He looks at the floor indicator.  TIGHT ON NUMBERS lighting up: \nThen the elevator stops, the doors open, looking down a dark corridor.  The PUPPET is at the end.  It turns to face him, SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its mechanical voice box. \nWhite STABS the buttons of the elevator frantically, the doors won't close.  The puppet is upon him.  He JUMPS, straight up. It goes under him, CRASHING INTO the back of the elevator. White hits the down button one last time, and leaps out of the compartment AS THE DOORS CLOSE. \nA MECHANICAL extendible arm shoots out and grabs White around the ankle. DRAGS him across floor.  THE PUPPET shrieks wildly again, as... \nITS ARM  -  is JAMMED in the closing doors now.  Lift descends. The puppet squeals.  The arm SNAPS OFF. \nWhite stands, pulls dislocated arm off his ankle.  He can hear the elevator descending.  Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts returning to his floor.  White turns and runs again. \nThe lift doors BURST OPEN  -  the ENRAGED CREATURE emerges and races after him. \nHe tears around a corner  -  finds himself in a dead-end. Nowhere to go.  He can hear the puppet approaching along the corridor.  Suddenly he notice A GRILL on a wall ABOVE HIS HEAD. He pulls it off, climbs into an incredibly tight pipe.  Crawls frantically. \nHe sees a LIGHT ahead.  An opening.  He kicks the grill off.  A sudden gust of wind. \nHIS P.O.V. \nThe pipe leads to the outside of the building  -  nowhere to go except a hundred stories STRAIGHT DOWN.  He screams, almost falls.  Turns to start crawling back. \nSuddenly the end of the pipe fills with WHIRRING METAL BLADES. The puppet has followed him in and is advancing. \nNo choice  -  he looks out the hole.  SEES A PIPE on the outside of the building, running vertically near the opening. It looks impossible but it's his only chance. \nHe climbs out, balancing himself on the lip of the opening, REACHES for the pipe.  The puppet is almost upon him.  He swings across, gets a HAND on the pipe.  He slips, DANGLES  - holding on  -  one hand on the pipe, one on the edge of the hole. The pipe is greasy, slippery, can't grip it. \nSUDDENLY he hears a MECHANICAL CLICKING  -  TURNS to see the puppet standing on the edge of the hole, inches from his hand. A soft noise reverberates in its voice box  -  a mechanical giggle?  A circular blade on one of its arms starts up, moves down onto White's HAND. \nTIGHT ON HIS EYES  -  sweat beads and runs down his forehead. \nTIGHT ON THE BLADE  -  as it cuts into flesh.  BLOOD spatters White's face as he grimaces with intense pain.  He can't hold on. \nHE FALLS, plummets through space.  Screaming. \n", "test2_true": "A GROUP OF SURGEONS stand about BUMSTEAD'S MOTHER on her life- support machinery.  The surgeons have face-masks on and are in deep shadow.  The woman stares blankly, still in a coma. \nIN THE RECEPTION AREA \nBUMSTEAD looks up from his wristwatch. \nBUMSTEAD I can't wait any longer... \nHe is standing in front of the MALE NURSE in the glassed-in counter. \nNURSE I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being examined... \nHe turns and storms off down the corridor.  The NURSE stands, shouting after him. \nNURSE Mister Bumstead! \nINSIDE MOTHER'S ROOM \nOne of the \"doctors\" leans down and grabs a handful of WIRES leading out of a box beside the woman. \nSURGEON We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs.  Yes. \nHe pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks  -  ALL THE MACHINES DIE.  The woman comes to life momentarily, starts to claw at the glass shield in front of her face, like she is suffocating.  The life drains from her weak body and she is STILL. \nANGLE ON THE DOOR  -  it bursts open.  Bumstead is standing there.  The masked surgeons are startled, they turn rapidly to face him. \nBUMSTEAD (steps forward) What is happening? \nSURGEON Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad you are here  -  I'm afraid we have done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother has passed.  Yes. \nBumstead turns towards his mother. \nBUMSTEAD But she was getting better... \nSURGEON We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was fatal. \nBumstead turns to the men, confusion in his eyes. \nBUMSTEAD She doesn't have cancer. \nThe men glance at each other for a moment, then back at the inspector. \nSURGEON We knew that.  Yes. (the other men nod) Anyway  -  she is dead. \nBumstead leaps forward, RIPS OFF one of the surgeon's masks. \nANGLE ON THE MAN  -  He turns to look at Bumstead, pale skin, staring eyes, a MYSTERY MAN.  TWO OTHER MEN grab him from behind. \nBUMSTEAD (struggles) I'll kill you all! \nOne of the Mystery Men steps up to the struggling inspector, places the palm of his hand across Bumstead's eyes. \nMYSTERY MAN You will obey us, yes.  In your mind there is a dark space... \nTIGHT ANGLE \nBumstead's hand reaches out, fumbles at a tray of surgical implements, grabs a SCALPEL. \nWIDER \nHe cuts into the hand of one of the Men holding him, SPINS AND DRIVES the scalpel into the forehead of the Mystery Man attempting to hypnotise him. \nThe other Men leap towards him. \nEXT.  CANAL  -  NIGHT \nTIGHT ON WHITE'S FACE \nHis eyes are shut tight.  He opens them, slowly LOOKS AROUND, curious why he isn't dead. \nWIDER ANGLE \nWhite floats in MID-AIR, hovering ten feet or so above a dark body of water.  He looks amazed.  Shuts his eyes, rubs them, opens them again.  Still floating. \nHe clenches his fists and TENSES his body.  Slowly he starts to MOVE FORWARD, hovering at an even height over the water. \nWIDER STILL \nSEVERAL ANGLES feature the figure of White levitating across the harbour, past half-sunken buildings and rusted ships. \nTIGHT ON WHITE  -  He comes to a stop.  Smiles in amazement. Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has opened beneath him. \nANGLE ON BUBBLES floating to the surface.  White's FACE rises slowly out of the water. \nWIDER  -  CITY SKYLINE \nA SMALL OBJECT floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny white parachute. \nBACK ON WHITE \nHe swims across to a small boat, climbs aboard, pushes himself silently through the still canals of the city. \nEXT.

Been waiting for you, yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way... \nThe Man motions with the gun for White to walk forward.  As soon as White turns to do this, the Man slips from the room and shuts the door, cutting off any existing light. \nA NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights start to come up all over the room. \nIt's a normal, average-sized, living room.  All the furniture has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums  -  an arrangement resembling an IMPROVISED COURT of law.  In fact, White realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box. \nThe apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the kitchen) and a series of figures step through.  MYSTERY MEN. \nAll the MEN take up specific positions around the room, without uttering a word, but don't sit.  One MYSTERY MAN opens a curtain beneath an arched entrance  -  beyond it, within a very small room, stand DOZENS OF PEOPLE, crammed shoulder to shoulder.  The people stare at White silently  -  a bizarre gallery of spectators. \nAn eerie silence falls on the room. \nThe kitchen door opens again.  White is shocked to see the VICTIMS WALK INTO the room and adopt positions in what is obviously the area for the jury. \nThe DISEMBOWELED CORPSE OF A WOMAN steps out of the shadows, pushing a pram.  Her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white sheet. \nWithin the pram is the BABY clutching its own head, with spine attached, under its arm. \nThen the mutilated FREDRICK hops out, followed by the three brown blood-stained paper parcels containing what is left of the YOUNG BOY. \nFinally, his WIFE and the JAPANESE WOMAN, still in passionate embrace, take their positions. \nAnother door opens  -  a closet. Within stands the figure we have only seen as a shadow  -  the elderly MYSTERY MAN with the cane. MISTER BLACK slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain hanging from the ceiling  -  the light snaps on inside the closet.  Somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a toilet is heard flushing. \nHe is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting his withered body on his cane.  Looks like he will play JUDGE. \nEveryone in the room now sits.  Mister Black looks at White. \nANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear, but cold. \nMISTER BLACK Welcome. \nWhite just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook called:  ANSWERS. \nMISTER BLACK John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes.  You wish to confess to these crimes now? \nWhite is silent.  He leans over and scratches his legs through the fabric of his trousers.  They itch like crazy. \nMister Black turns to the assembled people. \nMISTER BLACK Very well.  The testimony of the prosecutors.  Yes. \nTWO MYSTERY MEN stand and step across to a wooden easel.  MAN 1 stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc. drawn on stiff cardboard.  MAN 2 uses a pointer while he describes the evidence to support their case. \nMYSTERY MAN 2 We will show that John White is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes. \nMAN 1 places a large black and white photo blow-up on the easel.  It shows White at the door of the JAPANESE WOMAN'S apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood. \nMYSTERY MAN 1 Exhibit A shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes.  A photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents. \nWhite watches in stunned silence. \nA general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is made.  Mister Black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly. \nMYSTERY MAN 2 Exhibit B... \nMAN 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to MAN 2. \nMYSTERY MAN 2 Actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime, yes. \nHe turns a switch, the reels spin slowly.  A hush fills the room. \nVOICE 1 (sounds like JAPANESE WOMAN) No...  Please... \nA scream. \nVOICE 2 (sounds like White) Shut up! \nAnother scream.  A ripping sound. \nVOICE 3 (sounds like his WIFE) John!  Don't... \nAnother scream. \nWhite is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this any longer. \nWHITE (a squeak, almost inaudible) Stop it!  This is a lie... \nMister Black turns to White.  The Men testifying stop the tape and look at him also. \nMISTER BLACK Something to say?  Ready to confess? \nThe Men in the audience turn and all stare at White, as do the victims and the spectators in the adjoining room. \nWHITE (back to a whisper) I didn't kill anyone. \n", "test3_true": "WHITE (finds his voice) It's lies.  Everything. \nHe grips the barrier before him. \nA SHRIEK from the pram containing the BABY  -  it rocks violently from side to side. \nThe DISEMBOWELED WOMAN rises from her chair.  She has difficulty standing, her limbs stiff.  She looks at White, opens her mouth to say something, but no sound comes out.  Instead a tiny RED CRAB scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground. She sits down. \nWhite is stunned. \nMISTER BLACK Bring the witnesses. \nAN OLDER COUPLE are led out of the kitchen by a Mystery Man. Shown to seats behind a podium.  The woman looks sadly at White. \nMISTER BLACK You are the accused's parents? \nFATHER That's right. \nMOTHER Yes. \nWHITE Wait a minute... \nMISTER SLACK You had your turn!  Let them speak. \nWHITE (angry) My parents are supposed to be dead! You can't keep changing the damn rules like this!  Why go through this ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you just kill me and be done with it! \nMISTER BLACK (smiles at parents) Please, continue... \nWHITE This is insane! \nHe looks over to the victims. \nWHITE It was them, not me. (points at the Mystery Men) They killed you. \nLooks back at the Mystery Men. \nWHITE You have invented all this.  History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  - a fiction.  You are the authors. \nHis knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier. \nMISTER BLACK A fanciful idea, Mister White. \nWHITE Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a murderer. \nThe whole court listens in silence to White's testimony. \nWHITE You've given everybody memories, but I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that -  played your own game.  And now... \nWHITE looks at the MYSTERY MEN, then back at MISTER BLACK. \nWHITE You're trying to get rid of me. \nThere is silence.  Whispers.  Faces staring. \nWHITE Why do I threaten you?  You're scared aren't you? \nMISTER BLACK and the gathered MYSTERY MEN look speechless at White.  Suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous LAUGHTER, led by Mister Black. \nA terrible cackle fills the room  -  all the MYSTERY MEN laugh hysterically, so do the mutilated victims.  The spectators in the adjoining room remain silent. \nMISTER BLACK Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot! (chuckling) Very inventive... \nThe older couple behind the podium look disturbed. \nMOTHER Please, John, you're embarrassing us... \nWHITE Shut up! \nMISTER BLACK (chuckling still) You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes? \nWHITE (holds up notebook) It's all here! \nMister Black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's nothing. \nMISTER BLACK A book of delusions.  Anything else? \nWHITE But I... \nMISTER BLACK I see. (turns to the victims) The verdict, yes... \nWHITE Wait, this isn't fair... \nThe DISEMBOWELED WOMAN stands again.  This time she opens her mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then: \nDISEMBOWELED WOMAN (whisper) Guil  -  ty... \nWhite is agitated, fear in his face.  Mister Black stamps SOME PAPERS before him repeatedly. \nON THE PAPERS  -  official-looking documents.  The stamp says: GUILTY. \nCLOSE on White's eyes. \nMISTER BLACK Before I pronounce sentence... \nSuddenly the papers on the bench in front of Mister Black BURST INTO FLAMES.  Mister Black recoils, almost falling off his chair, taken by surprise.  The Mystery Men all look at White, a murmur of concern. \n", "test3_id": 2201}

{"test1_input": "INSIDE THE BOOTH \nThe inspector is upset, face strained.  A MALE VOICE chatters quickly through the receiver. \nBUMSTEAD (cuts in) ...but you told me the meeting was ten-thirty. \nA burst of chatter. \nBUMSTEAD I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well, inconvenient... \nA stream of chatter stops him. \nBUMSTEAD Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes... But, I've done fine so far without an assistant... \nThe inspector tries to interject as the VOICE cuts in again... \nBUMSTEAD But...  But I...  I... (defeated) Nine-thirty.  Yes. \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM \nWe are underwater.  WHITE's FACE swims into view.  Bubbles spew from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror. \nANGLE ON MEN'S ROOM \nWhite washes his face in a sink.  He looks up, wipes his face dry with his coat.  He turns towards the door to leave. \nThere are TWO  -  identical.  He cannot remember which he came through.  Takes a guess, opens one and steps into darkness. \nHe realizes he's picked the wrong door, tries to go back but the door CLICKS behind him:  locked. \nINT.  CONCRETE TUNNEL \nPitch black.  Trickling water.  A distant voice over a P.A. system recites names, followed by numbers.  A LIGHT, far away. White walks towards it. \nHe steps into a bare concrete area, a public phone hangs on a blank wall.  He pulls a coin from his pocket, puts it in the slot, dials the number on his message.  Ringing  -  no answer. \nSuddenly White feels cold. \nVOICE O.S. There you are. \nStartled, White drops the phone and turns.  A figure moves forward out of darkness: \nANGLE ON THE MYSTERY MAN from the hotel lobby.  The stranger wears a long black coat, dark glasses, and has extremely pale skin.  He is completely bald.  He studies White carefully. \nWhite glances about nervously  -  walks back up the corridor, his eyes pinned to the man. \nMYSTERY MAN You are lost, yes? \nWhite retreats faster. \nA FLASH OF STEEL  -  a dagger appears by the stranger's side, gripped in a black leather glove.  He moves forward, a grin on his pale face. \nWhite stops, backs against the wall. \nMYSTERY MAN Co-operate.  Do not make this difficult. \nWhite panics  -  he's cornered.  He remembers the revolver.  He pulls it from his coat and LEVELS it at the stranger, his hand shakes terribly. \nON THE STRANGER continuing to advance.  Something about his eyes makes White immobile, unable to think clearly. \nMYSTERY MAN You will not shoot, yes.  There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness... \nTHE GUN FIRES again and again.  Red splashes appear on the man. His shoulder.  His leg.  His neck.  He walks forward, with spastic jerks as bullets RIP into him. \nA final shot POINT BLANK into the stranger's forehead.  A stream of black liquid spouts from the hole. \nBlue smoke clears.  The man stands motionless, his mouth hangs open.  Then his eyes roll up, and he collapses to the ground. \nINT.  MORGUE  -  NIGHT \nCLICKING of new leather shoes, walking, striking tiles. INSPECTOR BUMSTEAD strides down a silent corridor.  He reaches into his pocket, removes a SURGICAL MASK, places it over his nose and mouth. \nWIDER ANGLE \nBumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor.  The man, who is dressed identically to the inspector, is his superior:  CHIEF-INSPECTOR STROMBOLI. \nBUMSTEAD Good evening, sir. \nSTROMBOLI Yes.  This way. \nSTROMBOLI leads the inspector into a tiled room containing several COVERED BODIES.  The two men are greeted by a cheerful- looking MORTICIAN. \nMORTICIAN Welcome, gentlemen.  You\u00edre early. Here for the examination, right? \nStromboli nods, then ignores the mortician and walks along the row of corpses.  Bumstead follows. \nSTROMBOLI The handiwork of an extremely sick individual. \nHe throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations. \nSTROMBOLI You\u00edve read the reports.  Not much to go on.  We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case... Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself. \nSTROMBOLI shakes his head, turns away from the final body, looks at the inspector. \nSTROMBOLI Why are you wearing that thing on your face? \n", "test1_true": "STROMBOLI I see. (continues) One thing\u00eds for sure, he\u00eds ambitious. You\u00edll be a busy man from now on. \nMORTICIAN You can say that again. \nStromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man.  The Mortician becomes serious and goes back to his work. \nBUMSTEAD What about Thompson, sir?  Wasn\u00edt this his case? \nSTROMBOLI Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isn\u00edt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need. (less business-like) By the way, how\u00eds your mother? \nBUMSTEAD She\u00eds getting better, thanks.  She... \nSTROMBOLI (cuts in) Very good... \nThe chief-inspector turns, paces to the door briskly. \nSTROMBOLI Let\u00eds go, Bumstead.  So much to do and so little time. \nEXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT \nA large faded BILLBOARD advertisement on a building facade.  A portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, \"LUMP- O\"  -  a cereal box carton. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY, rises upwards, CLOSER on the woman\u00eds face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her PAINTED IRIS. \nINT.  STAIR-WELL \nA raftered room on the other side of the billboard.  CAMERA TILTS TO a convoluted staircase  -  at the base, the SHADOW OF A MAN runs. \nFEET pace rapidly.  TILT UP TO REVEAL  -  WHITE. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS as he tries to lose himself from possible pursuers.  He steps through a low archway into a back alley, rounds a corner. \nA DEAD-END.  White stops, looks around, then up.  He\u00eds breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.  He starts to shake. \nABOVE, the walls stretch into darkness.  An OPENING way up there  -  he can see stars.  Something dark crosses the gap of sky.  A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.  Wind starts to pick up. \nTrash is being kicked up.  A sheet of NEWSPAPER wraps around White\u00eds leg.  He tries to kick it away repeatedly but it won\u00edt come off.  He bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but something grabs his eye. \nHe stares at the page for a moment  -  then his LEGS SLIP from under him and he falls to the ground.  He holds his head like it\u00eds going to explode.  A whimper deep in his throat.  His body is trembling violently. \nPUSH IN TIGHT on the paper on the ground.  A front-page headline:  MAN-HUNT CONTINUES FOR SERIAL KILLER! \nWhite looks up  -  terrified.  The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again. \nHIS P.O.V. \nON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments before there was nothing.  The door creaks open to reveal ANOTHER DOOR WITHIN.  This one extends outwards on the end of a lengthening wooden shaft. \nWhite, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket. Tries to side-step the ADVANCING DOOR but it\u00eds too late, he can only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the wall. \nINT.  HOTEL LOBBY  -  NIGHT \nHAND-HELD P.O.V. THROUGH the swaying beads hanging in the back- room doorway.  TWO FIGURES peer into the room. \nFIGURE 1 We are looking for Jonathan White. \nTHE HOTEL MANAGER looks up, moves forward into light:  a squat, hunch-backed man with glasses.  He steps through the beads, glares at the intruders. \nMANAGER What for? \nON THE MEN  -  an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to kill White.  Black coats, glasses, pale skin.  Creepy. \nA BLACK GLOVED HAND flashes forward, grips the manager\u00eds face and doesn\u00edt let go.  The manager struggles, gulps for air. He\u00eds pushed back heavily against the wall. \nMAN 1 Which room is he in? \nThe leather glove SQUEEZES, blood trickles from the manager\u00eds ears, through the fingers. \nINT.  ROOM 43 \nANOTHER (VERY SHORT) FIGURE is searching the room.  He hears NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against the wall. \nON THE MAN  -  FREDRICK  -  a stunted body, an oversized head, thick limbs.  The rest of his features lost in shadow. \nThe door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room. \nON THE TWO MYSTERY MEN as they step in and look around.  They search the room, knock stuff over.  One of the men kicks at the woman\u00eds corpse in the corner.  Behind him, Fredrick, still hiding near the door, slips into the corridor unnoticed. \nEXT.  FLYING P.O.V.  -  NIGHT \nA FLYING PERSPECTIVE past buildings.  An INSECT-LIKE BUZZING O.S.  Way down BELOW, in a canyon of silent buildings, a LONE FIGURE walks. \nEXT.  DOWN ON THE STREET \nA breeze pulls at WHITE\u00eds hair and coat.  He takes out the wallet  -  a few dollars. \nHIS P.O.V. AS HE WALKS \nThe city is DEAD.  Empty.  Desolate.  Buildings hang down out of black.  Day-time was never invented. \nAs he puts the wallet back in his pocket, a BUSINESS CARD he hadn\u00edt noticed, flutters to the ground.  He stops, picks it up. In simple print:  DOCTOR D.P. SCHREBER M.D., a phone number. Scribbled handwriting on the back says:  Thursday 0930. \nON WHITE  -  he glances across the street. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  A cafe.  A broken NEON FISH buzzes above the doorway. \n", "test1_id": 2199, "test2_input": "THE DOORS ARE OPENED \nThey step into a room of living animal experiments. \nSCHREBER We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting. \nWHITE I'm nothing then. \nSCHREBER Anything but, my friend. \nThe two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements. \nSCHREBER It feels no pain. \nWhite turns and starts to pace away.  Schreber reluctantly follows. \nWHITE Can I get my life back? \nSCHREBER Maybe. \nSchreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats. \nSCHREBER We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory. \nThe rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols.  Schreber turns to look at White, eyebrow raised. \nSCHREBER And then there is procedural memory. \nTIGHT ON HIS SLENDER FINGER  -  pointing to a machine also run by rats.  The object is to make it through a guillotine device. One rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two. \nSCHREBER Follow? \nWhite nods. \nSCHREBER Research on simple animals can be... useful.  To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example.  I am building an experiment with hamsters next. (looks at nearby cage of hamsters) Cute little things. \nSchreber puts a hand on White's shoulder. \nSCHREBER Listen to me talk!  You must be hungry. \nWhite nods again, extremely troubled. \nINT.  HALL-WAY (DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE) \nSchreber's office is an annex of his living quarters  -  a maze-like series of rooms and halls.  White is led down a dark hall by Schreber, clutching a candle. \nSCHREBER Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are. \nThey've stopped outside a flaking door. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nA small eat-in kitchen.  Dirty and run-down.  White, sits at a bench, as Schreber removes items from the refrigerator.  The doctor holds up a large FROZEN fish. \nSCHREBER Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just how I like 'em! \nANGLE ON FRYING PAN ON STOVE  -  The fish lands in it and starts to sizzle furiously. \nANGLE ON WHITE \nWHITE I'm sorry.  About before. \nSCHREBER I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help. \nA set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open slightly and THE NURSE looks in. \nNURSE (to Schreber) I have to talk to you. \nSCHREBER It can't wait? \nShe shakes her head, with a serious expression, then darts out again. \nSCHREBER  (to White) Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at home. \nHe leaves. \nAlone, White looks around the bleak room.  He takes off his coat and sits down again.  He removes the FISH.  The eye opens. The creature looks up at him.  It breaths painfully. \nWHITE Still kicking, huh? \nHe puts it back in his pocket. \nThe OTHER fish is spattering oil everywhere.  Smoke starts to fill the room.  White, steps over and looks at the frying pan. The fish is turning black.  He turns the heat down. \nHe notices a SMALL HOLE in the wall.  At eye height.  He steps across, looks through. \nTIGHT ON WHITE'S eye through the hole. \nHIS P.O.V. \nA dark room.  Shadows on the wall.  Something wet, some kind of ANIMAL, moving in the darkness.  He can hear breathing and whispering voices. \nWhite's eyes start to blur, he rubs them. \nSCHREBER O.S. How are things in here? \n", "test2_true": "SCHREBER Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about your dreams.  I'm very interested. \nWhite is having a hard time focusing. \nWHITE Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind.  You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing... \nWHITE'S P.O.V.  -  ANGLE ON Schreber with his back turned, at the stove.  THE IMAGE is blurring. \nSCHREBER Ah, our friends in black...  they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real. \nSmoke rises thickly around the doctor. \nSCHREBER I know everything about you.  You have no choice but to trust me. \nFlames are shooting up around Schreber from the frying pan. His arms catch fire, and he suddenly spins around clutching flaming daggers in both hands, his whole body engulfed in fire, his face charred, black flesh hanging off his skull. \nSCHREBER Scarey, isn't it? \nWhite startles awake. \nSchreber stands at the stove looking at White.  Everything is normal. \nSCHREBER Are you feeling alright? \nWhite stands awkwardly, pulls his coat on. \nSCHREBER What are you doing? \nWHITE I have to go... \nSCHREBER You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about... \nSuddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady himself. \nSCHREBER You're tired.  You need to lie down. \nON WHITE  -  swaying. \nWHITE Those pills... \nHIS P.O.V. \nThe scene is distorted  -  like looking through water.  Things start SPINNING. \nSCHREBER (echoic) Yes.  A little something to help you relax.  Harmless... \nA tile floor RISES rapidly TOWARDS CAMERA. \nCUT TO: \nGREY LIMBO \nObjects float underwater.  They rise upwards amidst bubbles, break the surface.  A storm at sea  -  dismembered BODY PARTS float all the way to the horizon. \nTWO FOETUSES in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass. \nFOETUS 1 This is madness.  If we're caught... \nFOETUS 2 Shut-up.  Help me with these straps... \nINT.  EXAMINATION ROOM \nWHITE wakes strapped to an exantination table.  SCHREBER and the NURSE loom above him.  The nurse hands Schreber a long, chrome SYRINGE.  The doctor moves towards White. \nSCHREBER (holds syringe up) Now you must relax, Anton. \nA DOOR-BELL RINGS O.S. The nurse makes for the door. \nSCHREBER Leave it! \nHe's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air bubbles.  THE DOOR-BELL RINGS again  -  very insistent. Schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed. \nSCHREBER Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of them! \nShe heads to the door  -  turns back. \nNURSE Keys. \nSchreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a huge collection of KEYS on a ring, walks to the nurse, hands them to her. \nWhite manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him.  The nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door, locks it.  He steps over to White. \nSCHREBER I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. (lowers syringe to White's forehead) There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way. \nWhite lashes out, PUNCHES the doctor in the face.  His glasses go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for the spectacles. \nA convenient scalpel cuts White from his remaining bonds.  He undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe INTO WHITE'S FOREHEAD. \nThe struggle continues  -  each man tries to turn the syringe on the other.  White pushes the doctor, who falls backwards. Schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical instruments. \nA loud THUMPING on the examination room door.  White is grabbed from behind, pinned down with the syringe INCHES from his face. \nA CRASH O.S.  Splintering wood.  The door bursts open. \nA ROTUND SILHOUETTE  -  is revealed, clutching a police special, flashing a badge.  A squeaky, over-excited, voice: \n", "test2_id": 2200, "test3_input": "Mister Black looks up at White  -  angered. \nMISTER BLACK How dare you use your tricks on me! \nWhite, genuinely surprised, looks around.  Several Mystery Men BACK AWAY from him, scared. \nWHITE I didn't realise... \nMISTER BLACK Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant. \nHe glares across the room, angrily.  An WOODEN CHAIR in a corner starts to vibrate. \nCLOSE on Mister Black's eyes. \nThe chair rises into the air  -  HURLS across the room at White. \nMister Black laughs as it crashes into the wall.  White ducks just in time. \nThe gathered Mystery Men erupt into enthusiastic applause. \nWhite regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own.  He lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin  - a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near Mister Black, making him dance back and forth comically. \nThis display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a WALTZ playing on a floating gramophone White has also activated with his mind. \nSEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.  White is amazed at his own performance. \nMISTER BLACK You'll regret that. \nMister Black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his mouth. \nMISTER BLACK (shouts) SHUT IT DOWN! \nA Mystery Man by the window, picks up a phone and dials furiously.  Everyone in the room remains silent  -  waiting. \nMAN ON PHONE Yes, we have a problem here.  Shut it down immediately. \nWhite doesn't understand what is going on.  O.S. the SOUND of machinery WINDING DOWN. \nANGLE ON a clock hanging on the wall.  ON the SECOND HAND.  It suddenly STOPS. \nAll eyes are on Mister Black. \nMISTER BLACK This has all gone too far.  Yes, much too far. \nMister Black starts to SHAKE.  His eyes shut, clenches his teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to the floor. \nAround the room WALLS CRACK, plaster rains down from the ceiling... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CITY  -  NIGHT \nAll over the city things START TO FALL APART  -  a devastating impact on the landscape. \nMONTAGE \nA street CRACKS OPEN.  Beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine-like organs.  These burst open with pus... \nA building vanishes... \nA car on a street corner flies into the air... \nA telephone box STARTS TO SPIN, faster and taster, digging itself into the concrete.  Monstrous INSECT LEGS sprout from the hole left behind... \nGeysers of STEAMING BILE spurt into the night sky... \nBLACK EXCREMENT forces up out of a sewer, runs down stone steps... \nTHE CITY is coming apart... \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.  APARTMENT H' \nThe room looks like an earthquake hit it  -  broken furniture and gaping holes torn in the walls. \nSeveral MYSTERY MEN huddle behind an upturned table, watching WHITE and MISTER BLACK.  They face each other, both still standing  - mental energies focused against each other in battle. \nThe fighting is taken its toll on both men. \nA DAGGER hangs suspended in mid-air, slowly rotating to face White with its shining silver blade. \nMister Black is clenching his rotting teeth, tightening bony fists by his side.  Pushing every ounce of mental power at the knife. \nWhite, bleeding from a gash in his cheek, is straining his mind against the knife. \nThe blade STARTS TO MOVE, ever so slowly at first, towards White.  His body is shaking with his mental effort.  A bead of sweat runs down his brow, dripping into his eye, blurring his vision. \nHe is losing. \nINT.  KITCHEN  -  NIGHT \nWe see an OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE.  A group of dark figures.  WHITE regains consciousness, strapped to a kitchen table.  From his perspective, in the immediate foreground, a figure speaks as he removes a syringe from White's FOREHEAD. \nFIGURE Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is easier now. \n", "test3_true": "Mister Black suddenly pulls at his own face, removes the mask. \nUnderneath is a mess of PULSATING ORGANS AND INSECT PARTS. This is what Mystery Men really look like.  He laughs, starts to MOVE rhythmically  -  a strange dance-step.  The others join in, as they too pull off masks. \nEach Man reaches up to his left ear in unison.  They pull squirming INSECTS out, hold them up to the light.  The insects scream triumphantly. \nWhite screams too.  And he can't stop. \nEverything goes BLACK.  Then the sound of a key rattling in a lock.  A door slowly creaks open... \nINT.  SEASIDE HOTEL ROOM  -  DAY \nA P.O.V. enters a small room. \nDappled SUNLIGHT through a tattered lace curtain. A clock ticks on a wall.  A cough O.S. from the corridor.  A FAT MAN, talks as he enters: \nFAT MAN It's small but clean... (it isn't) ...and the view's nice. (points to window) Isn't it? \nJOHN WHITE enters.  He is haggard, eyes rimmed with red.  He still holds the small black NOTEBOOK, tight to his chest.  He stands in the centre of the room, looks up.  Strangely, though the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories  - windows sit at various heights. \nWhite walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands. \nOUTSIDE \nA narrow street and at the end, the ocean.  The sound of distant surf, he can taste the salt spray. \nWHITE (without turning) I'll take it. \nThe man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go, shutting the door.  White puts the notebook down on a table near the open window. \nLATER \nWhite has fallen asleep on the bed. \nHe wakes, troubled.  Stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed.  He moves like he is underwater.  The sea-breeze tugs at the curtain, draws him to the window. \nHIS P.O.V. \nDown the street to the small patch of sand between buildings. TWO FIGURES  approach each other. \nHe pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the woman, places it against the pillow on the bed.  He sits on the edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs nothing out of the ordinary. \nWhite is disturbed by a TINY MOVEMENT in his coat pocket.  He reaches in and pulls out a small, EMACIATED FISH. \nDisgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the creature.  White raise his foot.  His heel comes down with a sickening SQUISH. \nTHE CAMERA MOVES IN STEADILY towards the notebook near the window.  As the SHOT TIGHTENS we can read the title on the cover:  ANSWERS  -  BY JONATHAN WHITE, AGE NINE. \nNow a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.  The pages flicker past.  Glimpses of happy things.  A child's drawings of smiling people.  The sun shining down on a blue ocean full of sailing boats.  Fields of colourful flowers.  Cute animals. \nINT.  LONG CORRIDOR  -  DAY \nSOUND OF SURF, distant, muffled. \nCAMERA MOVES slowly towards a door.  The final door  -  no others beyond this.  ECHOIC FOOTSTEPS. \nTIGHT ON WHITE  -  His haggard face moves through darkness.  He looks down at his walking feet. \nHIS P.O.V.  -  White sees water, waves breaking, through the cracks in the floorboards of the hallway. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white-hot, by the SUN outside. \nON HIS HAND  -  As he reaches towards the handle. \nON HIS FACE  -  As the door opens.  A sharp line of light cuts across his features, as his eyes blink and water.  The wind pulls at his messy hair.  SURF NOISE is louder now. \nREVERSE ANGLE  -  WIDER  -  OUTSIDE looking through the door, along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape.  At the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of A WOMAN WITH RED HAIR.  She looks out at the ocean, her back turned. \nANGLE LOOKS BACK at White standing in the open doorway, squints into the sun.  Suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the first time.  He steps OUT OF FRAME briskly  -  a weight gone from his shoulders.  Everything is clear finally, he knows exactly what to do. \nA voice recites names over a P.A. system. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nA TRACKING SHOT follows White, moves down the pier toward the woman.  As White steps up to her, she turns and smiles. \nWOMAN  (indicates the sea) Beautiful. \nWhite nods slowly.  He looks out of place in his crumpled suit. He stares out at the ocean.  Seagulls fly over.  Sun reflects off waves. \nWHITE Yes... \nWOMAN What's your name? \nHe looks at her.  Smiles.  Then, slowly, brings his hands to her throat. \nWHITE John...  White. \nFADE TO BLACK \nCREDITS \nDark City Writers : \u00a0\u00a0Alex Proyas Genres : \u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller User Comments \n", "test3_id": 2201}

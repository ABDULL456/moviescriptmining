{"train": "MINI'S FIRST TIME \nWritten by \nNick Guthe \nCLOSE ON: \nThe face of MINERVA \"MINI\" DROGUES, 18, watching something. She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl. \n-                    MINI (V.O.) I know what you're thinking. Don't bullshit me, because I do... You're -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge -         out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. I'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my -         mouth until I suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story. \nWe pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a \"FUCT\" T-shirt and jean shorts. \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school...I promise. \nCLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. \"When Animals Attack\" is on. In a series of quick cuts: \nA zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. \nA sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. \nA pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. \nAn alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull. \nMINI (V.O.) Since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started. \nMini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed Studio City hillside home. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY. \nTEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes. \nMINI (V.O.) I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday... \nMini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER- AEROBICIZED MOTHERS. \nMINI (V.O.) See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not only is she a lush, but she also hates me. \nDiane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday. \nMINI (V.O.) A few days before the party, I overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says \"I love you\" like ten inches of man meat in your face. \nDiane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing. \nMINI (V.O.) And knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed. \nMini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini, almost challenging her. \nMIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his imagination. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out. \nKayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable. \nMINI Yo, bee-ach! \nKAYLA Yo, birthday bee-ach! \nMINI Is it on? \nKAYLA Oh, it's on! \nMINI That's my girl! \nMini grabs Kayla and dips her low. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - LATER. \nKayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey, starting to wheel the cake down the long hall. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing \"Happy Birthday\", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION. \nMINI (V.O.) See, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. \"Firsts\" is what I call them. \nAs she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on Diane's face grows stronger with every step. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my first...rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many \"firsts\" into it as possible. \nWe switch back to real time. \nDIANE What the hell are you doing? I said wait until- (looking around) She's not even here, you morons! \nMINI No, Troy, I want to suck your dick right now! \nTROY Jesus, Mini, come on, get off! \nMINI (screaming) No, Troy! You said I could, now come on! \nShe gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't believe their eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI Let's see it! Come on, I want to suck your throbbing member right now! \nTroy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully and smiles. \nCUT TO: \nMini applying frosty hot pink lipstick, making her lips as full as possible. \nDIANE (O.S.) Mini? \nMini looks towards the door, deciding to ignore her mother. \nDIANE (O.S.) (screaming) \nMINI?! \nMini turns towards the sound. \nMINI WHAT?! \nDiane comes storming in. \nDIANE When I call you, I expect you to answer. \nMINI (flatly) Sorry. \nDIANE Don't patronize me. \nMINI (sugar sweet) Sorry! \nDIANE If you're trying to get me to call you a spoiled little ungrateful bitch, you're out of luck, because I won't give you the satisfaction. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Thanks, mommy. \nDiane's eyes narrow, as it's clear Mini knows exactly where her mother's buttons are. \nMINI (CONT'D) What do you want? \nDIANE I'm going out and I need you to wait for the delivery from the liquor store. They'll be here by nine. \nMINI Fine. \nDiane gives Mini the once over, lingering on her mini-skirt. Diane winces at the outfit. \nDIANE Just thought you should know, that makes your thighs look fat. \nMINI (deadpan) Gosh, you're right, mom, I'm such a cow. \nMINI (V.O.) It's a freakin' miracle I'm not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks. \nMINI Have fun, don't do anything I wouldn't. \nDiane turns and leaves. \nDIANE (over her shoulder) Well, that doesn't leave much. \nMINI (under her breath) Cunt. \nMini turns back to the mirror. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMini pulls on a pair of thigh-high stockings, as a lit cigarette hangs from M her mouth. \nMINI (V.O.) My mother moved out to LA from Ohio when she was twenty to become an actress. Even though she was a total flatliner, somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps...without screwing anyone. \nINT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOUSE - LATER. \nMini walks along the corridor in a pair of \"fuck me\" pumps, as the doorbell is heard ringing. \nMINI (V.O.) When she gets really sauced, she'll pop the tapes in and make me watch, then I'll threaten to call the suicide hotline. \nShe continues through the living room towards the door, hiking her mini skirt up a little. \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) After a few years, she got desperate and spread 'em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn. She got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn't be on the show, unless she hoovered me out. \nShe reaches the front the door. \nCUT BACK TO: 18 YEAR OLD MINI MIXING HER MARTINI IN THE WET BAR. \nMINI (V.O.) So it pretty much went on like that until... \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Mini? Diane? I'm home. \nMINI (V.O.) Five years ago, when she met Martin. \nMini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps. M MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was a win-win... \nINT. A HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT \nMini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world, style over substance is a way of life, works the crowd effortlessly. \nMINI (V.O.) He didn't want kids, but needed a ready-made family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings...We finally got out of Reseda... \nCUT TO: \nMini at the bar, stealing the drink of a TROPHY WIFE who has turned her back on it, to make a point to her OLDER HUSBAND. \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was great for about a year... \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth. \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) Then he figured out what he had married...by then it was too late. \nINT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE - NIGHT \nMartin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door. \nMINI (breezing past him) You're home early. \nMINI (V.O.) (CONT'D) First time in three months he's walked in before Letterman. He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now I'm thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or...found a new pin. \nMARTIN Yeah...uh... (searching) A dinner with a client got canceled. \nMINI (V.O.) Bingo. \nMINI Tough day? \nMARTIN About the same... \nThey head back into the living room. \nMINI Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists? M ARTIN Someone's got to make the payments on your Beemer. \nMINI (V.O.) He's a partner at a public relations firm, which is ironic because I can't remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together...or had relations. \nHe plops down on the couch, taking an electronic organizer out of his breast pocket. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Is your mother around? \nMINI No, she went to a party off Beachwood. She was in one of her \"happy moods\", so I doubt she'll be sleeping here... \nMARTIN Oh. \nMINI (innocently) If you were thinking of inviting a guest over. \nMARTIN (measured) I wasn't, but thanks for the concern...You're going out on a school night? \nMINI Yeah? \nMartin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind clearly elsewhere. \nMARTIN Mmm...Is your homework done? \nMINI Haven't even cracked a book. \nMARTIN (not listening) Mmm... \nINT. MINI'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick, compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms. \nMINI (V.O.) Considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed, you've got to admire his resolve. He could've left her years ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won't give in. \nEXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive. Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible sit in the open garage. \nMINI (V.O.) Their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm. \nMini gets into her BMW. \nEXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT \nThe BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of traffic.             M MINI (V.O.) As I said, the rule of firsts guides my life. Once you've gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for. \nEXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS - DAY \nThis time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school student, past a SECURITY GUARD. \nMINI (V.O.) But believe me, they didn't have too much trouble honoring that request. \nINT. AN IMPRESSIVE CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of the PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) I'd make house calls to offices at lunch hour and we'd say I was someone's niece or cousin in town on vacation. \nThe man stands up and greets her like she's family, and then quickly shuts the door. E XT. A HOUSE IN THE HILLS - NIGHT \nMini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a cheerleaders uniform. \nMINI (V.O.) And then when football season started, Saturday through Monday... \nINT. THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nA HUSKY MAN in a football jersey opens the door to find Mini waving her pom poms with a Texas sized grin on her face. \nMINI (V.O.) I was busier than Domino's. \nINT/EXT. A MULTI LEVEL PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nMini drives into the garage. \nMINI (V.O.) Then one Thursday night I get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so \"wifey\" doesn't find the motel bills on the gold card statements. They say I'm just his type...young. \nINT. THE LOBBY OF A MODERN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nMini walks quickly through the lobby. \nMINI (V.O.) They tell me he's not big on the chit-chat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for. \nINT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini knocks on the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) It's open. \nINT. THE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nThe executive \"convenience\" apartment is cold, sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees... \nMARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed. \nShe quickly turns away before he sees her face. \nMARTIN Hello? \nMINI (V.O.) Can you fucking believe it? \nMini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time. \nMINI Uh...hi, (quickly adopting a southern accent) Sorry, I'm Mlate. \nARTIN Don't worry about it. \nMINI Mind if I freshen up? \nMARTIN Sure. \nMini ducks into the bathroom. \nINT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks down at the counter. \nMINI (V.O.) My own dad! My first thought was \"how sick is he?\" But then I started thinking...I'm one to talk, and...well... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMini's expression softens as she examines herself closer. \nMINI (V.O.) Why not? I mean, he isn't my real dad...and talk about a first. The more I thought about it... \nA wicked glint dances across her eyes. \nMINI (V.O.) ...the more turned on I got. Then I thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed, I could do her strange guy in this bed. \nMARTIN (O.S.) Everything alright in there? \nMartin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the street below. \nMARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It appears to be about a three or four story drop. \nHe looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the railing. \nMINI Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take. \nMartin looks down at the street for another moment. \nMINI (V.O.) God, what a drama queen. Don't let this little act fool you. He'd never let mom get all his money. \nHe glances back at her, looking tortured. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI (V.O.) This is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter...ah ha! Contemplate suicide! M artin backs away from the railing. \nMINI (V.O.) Now that's thinking outside the box. \nINT. AN ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP - LATER. \nMartin and Mini sit at a booth. Martin stirs his coffee looking shell shocked. Mini devours a plate of Belgian waffles covered with whipped cream. \nMINI (V.O.) We spent the next few hours just sitting there. I don't think we said three words. I think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the sweetest nights I ever spent with a guy. \nEXT. VENTURA BLVD- JUST BEFORE DAWN. \nMini drives home with the top down. \nMINI (V.O.) He told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again. I told him that was fine. \nINT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING \nMini sits at the table eating cereal. Martin enters, looking a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance. \nMINI (V.O.) Suddenly, he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework. \nMARTIN Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math problems? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) Kiddo? \nMini looks up at him, raising her eyebrows. \nMARTIN I'd be happy to help you with it, if you need. \nMINI Actually, I'm thinking about starting a 401K plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund? \nMartin looks down uncomfortably. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMartin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well. Martin looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly blitzed, checks his watch and stands up. I NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMini lies in bed under the covers, reading. The door to her room opens. She looks at the clock. It reads: 12:15am. Martin enters. \nMINI (V.O.) It took exactly one week. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under the covers. \nMINI (V.O.) In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school. \nINT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nMini and Martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed- over glass shower door. \nMINI (V.O.) At first, we were very discreet, only doing it when Joan Crawford wasn't home or was completely comatose. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they both stare at the ceiling. Martin looks over at her and they share a conspiratorial smile. \nMINI (V.O.) Then we got bolder, doing it before she would pass out. I think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nMini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that leads to Mini's bedroom. Diane is watching TV with a martini glass in her hand. \nMINI (V.O.) One night we did it before \"Entertainment Tonight\" ended. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThem under the covers, but this time the lights in her room are on.              M MINI (V.O.) We even almost got caught. \nDIANE (O.S.) Mini? \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN I mean, I don't want to live under the same roof with her. \nCLOSE ON: \nA FEW RAIN DROPS HITTING THE ROOF OF THE CAR. \nMINI You can't leave, she'll get half. \nMartin exhales, knowing she's right. \nMINI Can I ask how the hell you married her without a pre-nup? Her? \nMARTIN (sighing) She wasn't as bad an actress as you think. \nMINI Well, there is another option. \nTHE RAIN PICKS UP, PLINK, PLUNKING ON THE ROOF. \nMARTIN There is? \nHer eyes harden as she looks out at the city. \nMINI But it will take some planning... and some resolve. \nMartin's eyes suddenly widen. \nMARTIN Wait, you don't mean- \nMINI Kill her? \nShe lets the word linger, as the rain beats down steadily. \nMINI No, of course not, she is my mother. \nMARTIN Good... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI But I've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill- \nMARTIN Ill? \nMINI Unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs. \nMartin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right. Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips.            M ARTIN It would be for her own good. \nMINI The only truly caring action we could take. \nMARTIN As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife. \nMINI You did it for the well being of your daughter. The selfless act of a devoted parent. \nThe sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips. \nMARTIN Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented. \nShe responds in kind, tilting her head. \nMINI And corroborated by friends and people outside the family. \nMARTIN A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI No, that would be useful. \nTheir lips are now almost touching. \nMARTIN And we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country. \nMINI With lots of fresh air. \nMARTIN It will be a much better life for her. \nMINI Much. \nUnable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each other's clothes. \nEXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe car rocks gently back and forth in the rain, as another car whizzes by, spray flying up behind it as it disappears around a curve. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nMini wakes up with a look of pure joy, ready to face the world. \nMINI (V.O.) I awoke the next morning, as excited as I could remember. Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this would take determination... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANTON Yes, I spoke to you myself, you say sometheeng come up. \nDiane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing. \nDIANE Jeanette, you knew I had an appointment today, did you pretend- \nJEANETTE (flustered) No, I, I ...Anton called me and told me he had a cancellation. \nANTON Yes, I call her after you call me. \nJeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around herself. \nDIANE Why, you sneaky little bitch! \nSuddenly, Diane LUNGES for Jeanette, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her off the table. Jeannette shrieks as Anton struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S DINING ROOM - EVENING \nDiane sits at the table with her arm in a sling. Martin cuts her meat for her, as Mini pours her some red wine. \nMINI (V.O.) Needless to say, word of the L'incid\u00e9nt de Anton spread quickly through the community. \nMINI Do you think she'll press charges? \nDIANE Are you kidding? She should get twenty to life! When I told Margo and Penny about her little stunt, they both said they'd have ripped her eyes out. She'll be lucky if anyone speaks to her again. \nMartin holds up a forkful of food. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Here comes the choo-choo. \nDiane grabs the fork with her good hand. \nDIANE For god's sake, I didn't break both hands. \nMINI Jeez, I still can't believe you broke your hand on her face? It's so Linda Hamilton. \nDIANE (slugging some wine) I hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed. \nINT. THE ROSA ANGELICA FLOWER SHOP - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON: The store's owner, CARLOS, 50, picking up the RINGING PHONE. \nCARLOS R osa Angelica, this is Carlos. \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) \nHello, Carlos, it's Diane Tannen calling. \nCARLOS Ah, s\u00ed, Senora Tannen, como esta? \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) (annoyed) Uh, Carlos...english, comprende? \nCARLOS (taken aback) Okay. \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) I'm going to need a delivery to the house. \nEXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nA \"MOONWALK\" INFLATABLE CARNIVAL RIDE is being inflated on the front lawn by a WORKER, as TWO JUGGLERS warm up next to it, tossing clubs between them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) Phase two: wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state. \nFIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF BOUQUETS and ARRANGEMENTS line the driveway. Mini stands outside next to Carlos, sucking on a lollipop. \nMINI Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers. \nCARLOS Your mother said you are having a big party! \nMINI (innocently) I know, can you believe all this? \nJust then, Diane's Jaguar pulls into the driveway. She looks at the trucks, her expression souring. She stops the car and flies out. \nDIANE Carlos, what the hell is going on? \nCARLOS Senora Tannen, the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party? \nDIANE Ordered, I didn't order anything?! Who told you to bring these here? \nCARLOS (flustered) But, but, Senora, you did, you called me, I talked to you. \nDIANE No, you didn't! \nINT. THE GIRL'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER. \nThe SCHOOL NURSE, HELGA HAUPTF\u00dcHRER, 55 and very Aryan, enters the empty bathroom and walks into a stall. \nMINI (V.O.) The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush named Helga Hauptf\u00fchrer, or \"der F\u00fchrer\" as she was affectionately known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip... I NT. THE STALL - CONTINUOUS \nHauptf\u00fchrer sits down and takes a bottle of vodka out of her nurses coat. \nMINI (V.O.) ...exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day. \nShe takes a long slug. \nINT. THE NURSE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet with a paper clip. She quickly looks through the bottles. \nMINI (V.O.) Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store. \nMini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label. \nCLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating \"RITALIN\" and the dosage. \nMini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptf\u00fchrer enters. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and the lazy parents willing to let \"Der F\u00fchrer\" keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING \nMini stands at the counter, making her mom A MARGARITA. She's cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender. \nMINI (V.O.) My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more. \nShe then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender and puts the lid on. \nMINI (V.O.) Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick-me-up. \nShe turns on the blender. \nINT. DIANE'S DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER. \nDiane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry. \nDIANE (annoyed) Mini! I asked you for that drink ten minutes ago! \nMini walks in, carrying the margarita. D IANE Put it on the counter. \nMINI You're welcome. \nDiane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIANE Mmm...this is really good. What's in it, Sweetie? \nMINI (V.O.) The first time in my life she calls me \"sweetie\" and I've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys. \nMINI Oh, this and that. \nINT. A POSH PARTY IN THE HILLS - NIGHT \nThe party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN. \nDIANE My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face... \nThe two women recoil. \nDIANE ...was the best thing that ever happened to me. \nMINI (V.O.) Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public. \nDIANE I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, I would've let him stick his javelin in me any day. \nSuddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS. \nHUSBAND #1 So I looked each and every juror in the eye- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIANE (spinning around) I want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries? \nHUSBAND #1 Uh... \nDIANE I'd like to be on a jury and say \"guilty!\" or \"sidebar!\" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of \"Bikini Girl\" and my line was \"I'll have another,\" it was with \"Isaac\" at the pool bar. I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it. T he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance. \nHUSBAND #2 Uh, I think I could use a refill. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) Do you feel safe? \nDIANE (looking around) Who is this? \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) You didn't answer the question. \nMini and the two skatepunks giggle with glee at the terror they're inflicting. \nShe looks around, scanning THE MALL. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.            D IANE This isn't funny. I'm hanging up. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) I wouldn't do that. \nDIANE If this is some kind of joke... \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) I assure you, I'm no joke. May I say that pink blouse is very fetching. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPanicked, she heads for an exit. A FEW SHOPPERS look at her with concern. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) Diane, your car is the other way. (menacing) Now answer my question. Do you feel safe? \nA whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around. \nDIANE I'm hanging up. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) (very calm) Hang up and you're dead. \nDIANE (falling apart) Why are you doing this? \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) Can you see me? \nShe scans the crowd frantically, then starts walking towards a VICTORIA'S SECRET STORE for help. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) Pick me out something sexy. \nDIANE Leave me alone! \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) (very calm) But I'm so close to you... \nShe stops, frozen in fear. Just then, the second SKATEPUNK comes up behind her, brushing into her. She jerks away from him. \nDIANE (screeching) Get away!!! \nEVERY SHOPPER within ear shot turns around, including TWO SECURITY GUARDS. \nSKATEPUNK #2 Take it easy, lady, what the hell's your problem? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nThe skatepunk walks away. \nMINI and THE FIRST SKATEPUNK watch with amusement from an upper level as A SECURITY GUARD moves towards her. \nMALE VOICE (V.O.) Peek a boo...I'm coming for you...but that guard can't help you. Maybe you should make a run for that Gold Jag you drive home to Mira Loma Lane. \nDIANE (whimpering) How do you know where I live? \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) I know everything about you. \nDIANE No! \nDIFFERENT MALE VOICE (O.S.) \nMaam? \nDiane spins around to find TWO SECURITY GUARDS standing behind her. S ECURITY GUARD #1 \nI'm going to have to ask you to leave the mall. We'll walk you to your car. \nDIANE No! I can't leave, he knows where I live! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 \nMaam, you're going to have to leave. \nDIANE Did you hear me?! He knows where I live! \nSECURITY GUARD #1 \nWho knows? \nShe hands him the phone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIANE Him! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one holds a HAND AXE. \nShe turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises the axe slowly. \nDIANE No...no...help! Help! \nShe heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room. \nINT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS \nDiane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife appears in the door frame. \nDIANE Oh, God! Help! Someone! \nDiane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles. \nDIANE (softly ) No, please, no. \nShe slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure D violently tugs at the handle. \nIANE Help! Someone please, help me! \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nShe runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out the peep hole. \nPEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear. \nShe starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on. \nTHROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nShe opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE WIELDING FIGURE. \nIt shakes a finger \"no\" at her, as it walks towards the house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her. She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper- ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears. \nDIANE Please God, please God...please! \nShe looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly, her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen. \nDiane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door. \nINT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDiane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her. D iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice through her sobs. \nCLOSE ON: \nA PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle. \nMINI (V.O.) Our work finished... \nINT. DOCTOR HOGGLY WOGGLY'S TYLER TEXAS BARBECUE - LATER. \nMini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of beef put in front of them. \nMINI (V.O.) We rewarded ourselves on a job well done... \nINT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER. \nMini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom. \nMINI (V.O.) And we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old. \nMINI Mom, we're home! \nMARTIN Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork plate! \nThey reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed. Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane could still be in there. \nMARTIN Honey? You okay?...Honey? \nMINI Mom? \nMartin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try to wake her up. \nMARTIN Diane, it's us, wake up. \nMini slaps her hard across the face. \nMINI (feigning concern) Wake up, Mommy. \nMARTIN Mini. \nMINI Killjoy. \nMINI (V.O.) Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my birthday, produces it and it's so twisted, I'm surprised I didn't think of it. \nOn the screen, the host introduces THE COUPLE, who nervously walk out to the studio applause. \nMINI (V.O.) Take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fianc\u00e9s. \nThen the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of the couple. Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking than the engaged couple. \nINT. THE BATHROOM - LATER. \nMini checks Diane's pulse. \nMINI (V.O.) And we waited some more. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - LATER. \nMartin sits on the couch. He looks up as Mini comes in from the bathroom, shaking her head \"no\", indicating she's not I dead yet. \nNT. THE BATHROOM - LATER. \nMini checks Diane's pulse again. \nMINI (V.O.) Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last act of free will... \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe 11 O'clock news is starting, as Mini impatiently looks towards the hallway leading to the bathroom. \nMINI (V.O.) Finally, it was time to do the only humane thing. \nMini stands up. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Come on, let's go. \nMARTIN What? \nMINI It's time to speed this up. \nMARTIN Speed this up? \nMINI We can't wait anymore, our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour. We can say that after dinner we went to a movie, but if she hasn't croaked by midnight, you can forget about this. \nMartin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the implications of \"speed this up\". \nMARTIN No, I'm sorry, this is going somewhere I'm not prepared to go. \nMINI Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in? I hate to break it to you, but wherever you \"weren't prepared to go\"...the hypocrite express just rolled into the station. \nMartin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth of his actions. \nMARTIN What are you suggesting? \nMINI Well, I thought we'd disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons. \nMartin recoils. \nMINI Kidding...God, you've lost your sense of humor. Don't worry, it'll be painless. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMartin takes a deep breath, considering his options. \nINT. DIANE'S WALK IN CLOSET- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini goes through her mother's clothes, as Diane lies crumpled in a heap on the floor. Martin looks on impatiently. \nMINI (V.O.) To be honest, I think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this. And as my first assisted suicide, I was going to make it flawless. M \nARTIN Come on, we don't have time. \nMINI Look, if we're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven. (off his confusion) The gas chamber? (exasperated) Martin, please, I can't explain everything. \nMini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length mirror. \nCUT TO: \nMini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front of her vanity mirror. Martin holds Diane's head still. \nMARTIN I don't think this is a good idea. \nMINI Have you lost your mind, \"Mr. Public Relations\"? What's the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out? (waits for his answer) \"How did she look\"? Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is \"fabulous\"? \nINT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe door to the dark garage opens and Mini turns on a light. Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his shoulder, struggles through the doorway. \nINT. DIANE'S JAGUAR- MOMENTS LATER. \nMINI Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home and tell everyone we're a couple? We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers. \nMartin stops and looks at her, surprised. \nMINI Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward? \nHis face turns a little red. \nMINI I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration. \nMartin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed. \nMARTIN You realize he could blackmail us? If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine. \nMINI Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen. \nHer words don't appear to have calmed him. \nEXT. THE POOL - DAY \nMartin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini. \nMINI (V.O.) The next few days were a laugh riot. \nMartin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously. Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth. He instinctively pulls back. \nMINI (V.O.) Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father. \nJust then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes M channels. Mini looks very annoyed. \nMINI (V.O.) We returned home and things didn't get much better. \nMONTAGE: \nMini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror: \n-Catholic School girl. \nMINI (V.O.) What little sex we were having    was getting dull. \n-Cheerleader. \nMINI (V.O.) Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed... \n-Naughty Nurse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) I was bored. I became concerned that in my world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first... \n-French Maid. \nMINI (V.O.) ...at too young an age. \n-Marilyn Monroe in the sequined dress she sang to JFK in. \nMINI (singing breathily) \"Happy birthday, Mr. President\" \nMINI (V.O.) As for school, well, I was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death. \nTHE DOOR BELL RINGS. Mini looks towards the hallway. \nEXT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well. \nMINI (V.O.) Uh oh. \nMINI Yes? \nGARSON Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I don't know if you remember me? \nMINI Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And \"yes\", I remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm. \nGARSON (ignoring her dig) So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Nice work, McGruff. \nGARSON Again, I am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible. \nMINI What do you want? \nGARSON I need to ask you a few more questions about your mother's death.    M INI Sure, come on in. \nMARTIN What the hell's gotten into you? I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me? Mini, in a relationship, it's okay to worry about someone else. \nMINI (V.O.) I kind of have to admire this. He really is one of the world's premiere bullshit artists. \nMARTIN Haven't you ever been in a relationship? \nThe questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost ashamed. \nMARTIN My god, you haven't. \nShe tries to hold back the tears as she looks up. \nMINI Congratulations... (sniffling) you're my first. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHe comes over and gives her a very sweet hug. \nMARTIN Oh, angel. \nMINI (V.O.) And I'd like to thank the academy and god and, oh yeah, \"Free Tibet\". \nINT. AN ELEVATOR - MORNING \nMartin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS. His eyes look tired from staying up all night. \nMINI (V.O.) Fake tears aside...he actually was my first relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able to find someone who could accept me on those terms. \nINT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING \nHe strides off the elevator sending \"hellos\" and nods to his employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: \"BOYD, MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES\". \nMINI (V.O.) And I was willing to give him the chance to be that person... \nHe reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is waiting with an envelope. \nMINI (V.O.) ...if he could just hold it together. \nMARTIN Morning, Lois. \nLOIS Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for you. \nShe hands him a manila envelope marked \"MARTIN TANNEN- VIA MESSENGER\". He takes it from her and walks into his office, sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy photo of: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO. The caption reads: \"THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS\". \nMINI (V.O.) That's when things started to get interesting. \nMartin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER, but no return address. \nINT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER. \nMartin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell. \nMARTIN Lois, I need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting... (listening) I know...Tell him...tell him it's an unavoidable emergency. \nINT. SPEEDWAY COURIER - DAY \nMartin stands at the front desk, talking to A CLERK. \nMARTIN What do you mean you don't keep records on who your senders are? \nCLERK When it's paid cash, we only keep records on packages, not envelopes. \nEXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS \nMartin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he answers it. \nMARTIN Yeah? \nLOIS (O.S.) Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr. Chapman...he told me to tell you that he's going to be seeking a new firm to handle his company's needs. \nMartin's jaw tightens. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Thank you, Lois. \nMartin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT. \nMartin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control. \nINT. A CONFERENCE ROOM AT MARTIN'S FIRM - LATER. \nMartin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised and concerned. \nRUDELL It was just finished. I'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed. \nMINI I know she'd approve. \nRUDELL If you don't mind me asking, ...how are you doing? \nMINI It's been hard, but I guess I've just been telling myself that she's probably much happier where she is now. \nRUDELL You're absolutely- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Positive!? \nMini giggles, almost embarrassed. \nRUDELL (chuckling) Well, that too, but \"correct\" was the word I was thinking of. Do you like the show? \nMINI Oh, god, it's my favorite. I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together. \nRUDELL I could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you'd like, or even be a contestant? \nMINI A contestant? Really? \nRUDELL Sure, those dates are really quite harmless. You just spend an evening with the person. We prep you on what to say before the show. \nMINI It sounds like fun. \nRudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her. Mini, keenly aware, blushes. \nRUDELL Anyway, what's on your mind? \nMINI Well, um...this may sound strange, but you haven't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately? \nRUDELL No, is everything okay? \nMINI Yes, it's just that since mom's death, someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRUDELL Together? \nMINI It indicated that we were...I know this sounds crazy, but...a couple. \nRUDELL A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm...I mean, certainly older men and younger women are an (searching again) ...accepted part of society, but for someone to do that, well...it's just tasteless. \nMINI Exactly, so we're just trying to figure who Rit could be. \nUDELL Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at all...Out of curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together? \nMINI Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or anything. I mean, of course, he's seen me naked, he is my step- father. \nRUDELL Of course. \nEXT. RUDELL'S POOL - LATER. \nMini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini flirts shamelessly with him. \nMINI (V.O.) Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage... \nEXT. RUDELL'S HOT HOUSE - LATER. \nRudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) I knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time. \nEXT. RUDELL'S PUTTING GREEN - LATER. \nRudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her, wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the swing. \nMINI (V.O.) And the one undeniable fact I had learned from Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man's life... \nINT. RUDELL'S KITCHEN - LATER. \nRudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip cream. \nMINI (V.O.) ...than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to. \nHe accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes. \nMINI (V.O.) Frankly, I'm surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn't give him a stroke right there. E XT. RUDELL'S FRONT GATE - LATER. \nMini walks out, skipping down the path, singing \"The Candy Man\" to herself. \nMINI \"Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can\" \nMINI (sniffling) You gonna cuff me, Copper!? \nGarson looks at Mini, clearly not convinced of her innocence. \nGARSON She's free to go. \nINT. THE LOBBY OF MARTIN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nMartin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby. GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him. Martin looks a little unnerved to see them. \nGARSON Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming up to see you. Have you got a minute? \nMARTIN Detective, I told you no more questions without my lawyer. \nGARSON I think you'd better call him. \nINT. AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER. \nMartin sits at a table, conferring with his lawyer, NED VOLANT, an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick, heavily gelled hair. Garson sits across from them. \nGARSON There's a small discrepancy that I can't quite figure out and I was hoping you might be able to explain it. \nMARTIN I suppose I can try. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGARSON The final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didn't die from the pills. She wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her. M ARTIN Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update- \nVOLANT Martin, easy. \nMARTIN I'm sorry, but this is harassment. \nGARSON See, here's what I needed to ask you. The gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used. \nMARTIN And? \nGARSON Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. An unconscious person can't turn on a car, right? \nVOLANT Detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point? \nGARSON Well, here's where I get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas. \nMartin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay. \nGARSON So, there's really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours. Is there? \nHe looks at Martin, waiting for an answer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGARSON So, I guess what I'm asking is, whose idea was it to put her in the car? \nVOLANT Martin, don't say anything. \nGARSON Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but I've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship. \nVOLANT Again, Detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse. \nGARSON I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, I'd be careful. The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town. \nMartin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn, V whispers back. \nOLANT Does this mean he's offering Mr. Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter? \nGarson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for his answer. \nGARSON It's a strong possibility. But he wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing. \nMartin's eyes shift slightly. \nINT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGarson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident as Martin's lawyer. \nMINI It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick. \nGarson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve. \nPELHAM (nervously) Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer- \nMINI Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow... \nMini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin. \nMINI ...my tongue. \nEven Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation. \nGARSON Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin. \nMARTIN You? You went on- \nMINI Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now shhh... \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN: \nHOST Jason, you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJASON (a bit nervous) Well, since Becky and I have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, I just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how I would react. You know, whether there'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision? \nHOST So, after dinner, what happened? \nJASON Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew. I'm not really a good dancer, but I said \"yes.\" \nBECKY (hurt) We never go dancing. \nJason smiles at her uncomfortably. \nHOST So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer? M INI Well, he's a damn quick learner, and not just at dancing. \nMARTIN shoots a look at Mini \nMINI Martin, for god's sake, that was their line. You think I talk like that? \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN: \nHOST Oh, really? So there was some other teacher-student stuff going on? \nJASON (uncomfortable) Uh, no, not really- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI Oh, come on, what about when we went back to your place? \nBECKY You what?! \nJASON I, I don't know what she's talking about. \nMINI Come on, don't be bashful. He put on some soft music and- \nJASON No! This isn't true, why are you- \nMINI We started kissing and- \nBECKY Jason! \nJASON (to Mini) Shut up! \nSTUDIO AUDIENCE OOOOHHHHH! \nMINI But, Jay-Jay, it was really special. (to the host) He loves to be called \"Jay-Jay\". \nBECKY You, you... \nMINI Let me tell you, Becky, you're in for a wild ride from this Bronco. \nSTUDIO AUDIENCE WHOOOOOOAAAA! \nCUT TO: \nMARTIN staring at Mini. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMARTIN Did, did you... \nBECKY (O.S.) You slept with her?! \nMINI God, Martin, it was a one time thing. He was a virgin, how could I say \"no\"? Believe me, she'll thank me after their wedding night. \nMARTIN You had me come home early to- \nMINI Don't be jealous. It won't happen again. It was just a goof. \nMartin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN: \nBECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage. \nMARTIN picks up the remote and hits \"mute\". \nMARTIN Rudell? He let you go on? \nMINI Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I wasn't really supposed to, you know, \"go all the way\" but- \nMARTIN I can't believe you...th-that couple, you ruined their relationship. M INI Excuse me, but the show is called Absolutely Positive for a reason. Clearly, the only thing Jason was positive about was- \nA MAILMAN hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door. She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other bags full. \nEXT. A DUSTY TWO LANE ROAD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY - DAY \nThe sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes convertible with the top down. \nMINI (V.O.) Martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since I was eighteen, I was allowed to live by myself. \nShe turns down another road at a sign reading \"LOMPOC STATE PRISON, 5 MILES\". \nINT. A VISITING ROOM AT LOMPOC - DAY \nMini and Martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier. There are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy. \nMINI I'm sorry I forgot to bring that book you wanted. \nMARTIN It's okay, Myou can mail it. \nINI Are you okay? You look like you haven't showered in days. \nMARTIN (disturbed) Well...uh...you have to be careful about sh-...So how's school? \nMINI (excited) You'll never guess what happened. \nMARTIN What? \nMINI I was voted valedictorian! \nMARTIN But don't you have to be- \nMINI The best student? I know! But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss. \nMARTIN (smiling sadly) I wonder how the real valedictorian feels? \nMINI Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Is Rudell out of his coma yet? \nMINI I don't know, why? \nMARTIN Why? (taken aback) Mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures. \nMINI (nonchalant) Oh...I wouldn't worry about that. \nMARTIN But if the D.A. got those pictures, you could- \nMINI I'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them. \nHe looks suddenly very worried. \nMARTIN Mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? Because I've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that. \nMINI Help us? \nMARTIN They know people on the outside we could...pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you. \nMINI Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but I'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet. \nMARTIN What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines Martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo. \nMINI Oh...wow, like I thought you were just playing along `cause I'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know? \nMartin furrows his brow, confused. M INI Rudell didn't send those pictures. \nHe suddenly becomes very still, as Mini's lips curl in a thin smile. \nMINI You remember, Aurelio? \nMartin looks at her blankly. \nMARTIN Our cabana boy from Mexico? \nSuddenly, it hits him.   He looks almost nauseous. \nMINI What a sweetie, I thought I might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough. \nHis knuckles tighten around the phone. \nMARTIN You...you... \nMINI It was pretty clear Garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. It just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering. \nMartins jaw tightens as his pupils go black. \n", "test1_input": "Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question. \nMARTIN Of course, we did that too, but I couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but... (taking a breath) it didn't work. \nGARSON So your wife did this sometime between 8:00 and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call? \nMARTIN Yes. \nGARSON May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state? \nMARTIN We never thought she'd do anything like...this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It's been a very stressful time. \nGARSON Of course. So this was your wife's car? \nMARTIN Yes. \nGARSON Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in? \nMARTIN What? \nGARSON Was it in the garage when you left? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARTIN (a little flustered) Is, is that important? G ARSON Just trying to reconstruct what happened. \nMARTIN Oh, well...after she was brought home from the mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage. \nGARSON And no one drove it during those three days? \nMARTIN No, Mini and I have our own cars. \nGARSON We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab. \nMARTIN Crime lab? Oh, okay. \nGARSON Again, purely routine. \nMARTIN Sure. \nGARSON Have you found a note yet? \nMARTIN (confused) I'm sorry? \nGarson's eyes flicker for a split second. \nGARSON A suicide note? The deceased usually leaves one. \nMARTIN Oh...right, no...not yet. But we haven't really looked. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nGARSON Mind if I take a look around? \nMartin hesitates for just a split second. \nMARTIN No...of course not. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini and Martin whisper together. \nMINI Who cares if we didn't leave a note? Just relax. \nMARTIN But they said it's-- \nMINI So what? He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead. \nMARTIN (remembering something) Oh, shit! \nMINI What? \nMARTIN The sweatsuits and goggles. \nMINI I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage cans. \nMARTIN (exhaling) Good. \nMINI Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we're free. \nEXT. THE LAS HADAS RESORT- MANZANILLO MEXICO - DAY \nMartin and Mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) After the funeral, I felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time. \n", "test1_true": "MINI (V.O.) Martin agreed and let me pick the place. I chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that's where Dudley Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten. \nEXT. THE BEACH - DAY \nMartin spreads sun tan lotion on Mini's back. \nMINI (V.O.) I figured sugar daddy/younger woman would be old news down there. \nA few other OLDER MAN/YOUNGER WOMAN couples lounge near them, mixed among more traditional pairings. \nINT. AN OUTDOOR TIKI BAR/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nMARIACHIS play a sexy Mexican ballad as Mini, wearing a thin sundress, dances very close with Martin. \nMINI (V.O.) I could feel that Martin had let the whole thing with the cops go. It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago. \nEXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT \nMini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare up at the stars. The gentle breaking of waves further adds to the tranquility of the evening. \nMINI You know, I've been thinking that I might enjoy working in your office this summer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Really?   Sure, if you want. \nMINI I want. \nShe moves to kiss him. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Martin, Mini? Is that you? \nMartin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate material. \nMINI (V.O.) I swear I thought Martin was going to wet himself. \nMini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent father/daughter closeness. \nMARTIN (extremely tense) Oh...hi, Mike, what, what are you doing here? R udell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter they were lying. \nRUDELL Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little R&R, and I suddenly realized I hadn't taken a vacation in god knows when. Jennifer, this is my neighbor Martin Tannen and his daughter, Mini. \nMartin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She looks equally uncomfortable. \nMINI I'm sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met? You look so familiar. \nJennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile. \nJENNIFER I don't think so. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI (V.O.) And the icing is that Jennifer works for the same escort service that I did. Now this is rich. \nMIKE I wanted you both to know how sorry I am for your loss. \nMINI (V.O.) Our loss? He just lost six or seven freebies a year. \nMIKE If there's anything I can do... (to Mini) for either of you... \nMINI (V.O.) Yikes, now that Mom's out of the way, I guess I'm fair game. \nMIKE ...don't hesitate to ask. Remember I'm just right across the fence. \nThe meaning is not lost on Martin. \nMARTIN (measured) Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it. \nINT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER. \nMartin paces back and forth as Mini sits on the bed. His neck muscles bulge with frustration. \nMARTIN Why did you tell him?! \nMINI I was just being friendly, I had no idea he'd decide to come here. \nMARTIN He knows. He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows! \nMINI I doubt he even knows where his trash cans are. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED:             MINI(CONT'D) You're overreacting. It's just coincidence. \nMARTIN Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us together. \nMINI It was dark, I sat up before he saw anything. M \nARTIN No, he knows. It was like he was toying with us. \n", "test1_id": 744, "test2_input": "MARTIN Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do I need my lawyer here? Because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation. \nGARSON Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just finish this up, I've got real homicides that need attention. How about if I just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip? \nMINI That sounds good, doesn't it, Dad? I mean, let's just get this over with. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMartin looks at Mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second. \nMARTIN Fair enough. \nGARSON Terrific...now, the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system. \nMini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad. \nMARTIN I wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin. \nGARSON Neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it. \nMARTIN Well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, I'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription. \nGARSON I know, but it's an odd drug to be taking. It's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them. But in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated. \nMARTIN Again, Detective, I really can't say why she was taking these drugs. \nGARSON Fair enough...Mr. Tannen, were you and your wife close? \nMARTIN No...we led, for the most part, separate lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI (V.O.) O oh...sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit of the child. Excellent. \nGARSON I see... \nMARTIN Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I don't see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely disturbed person. Haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst? \nGARSON Yes, but what I'm still unclear about is her time of death. \nMARTIN Well, that makes two of us... Again, detective, we were out for the whole evening. \nGARSON (looking at his notes) After dinner you saw a movie that night? \nMARTIN That's right. \nMINI (V.O.) Start time 9 o'clock. \nGARSON What did you see? \nMARTIN That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore. \nMINI (V.O.) Running time 115 minutes. \nGARSON Ahh...My buddy told me the end is crazy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMINI (V.O.) For god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it? \nMARTIN Yeah, he slides down Washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him. \nMINI Dad...Don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet. \nMartin turns to Mini, giving her a fatherly smile. \nMARTIN Another demerit... \nMini rolls her eyes at Garson. \nGARSON That's okay...Where did you see it? \nMARTIN The Galleria. \nMINI (V.O.) Drive time 17 minutes. \nGARSON And you got home at? \nMINI (V.O.) Precisely... \nMARTIN \nMINI (V.O.) With 12 minutes of previews. You didn't think we'd forget the previews? \nMARTIN Now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night. \nGARSON No, that about wraps it up for now. \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: (4) \nMARTIN For now? Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up. We've told you everything we know.     G ARSON I wish I could be more definitive. \nMARTIN Well, I'm telling you the next time you have a question, it had better be because you're charging us- \nGARSON Us? \nMartin momentarily freezes. \nMARTIN I'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives. \nGARSON (standing) Thanks again for your time. \nEXT. THE POOL - LATER. \nMini sits in a chair as Martin paces. \nMARTIN What the hell was I thinking, letting you talk me into this? \nMINI It's probably just routine stuff. \nMARTIN That was not routine, my dear. \nMINI Nice use of the word \"us\", by the way. \nMARTIN Sorry, it just slipped out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI If I had a nickel for every time I heard that- \nMARTIN (sharply) Okay. \nMINI Look, just chill, I'm sure this will blow over in a few days. \nMARTIN Chill?! Believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. You do understand they could go for the death penalty? \nMINI He's probably just trying to spook us. \nMARTIN Hello?! They don't try and spook you unless they think you did it! \nMINI It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't. \nMARTIN (seething) Well, if it was such a great plan, why am I cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide? \nMini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside. \nMINI I'll see you later. \nMARTIN Where are you going? \nMINI Out. \nINT. A DANCE CLUB IN EAGLE ROCK - NIGHT \nThe club is packed with YOUNG LATINO CLUBHOPPERS gyrating to the pulsating beat. Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively with a MUSCULAR YOUNG LATINO. M MINI (V.O.) Would he follow? \nHis face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in ecstasy. \nAs she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room. \nMARTIN stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen. \nMINI (V.O.) Was there any question? \nMini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not. \nMartin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her partner a deep, long kiss. MARTIN looks ill. \nEXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAWN \nMini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking rumpled. \nINT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a bathrobe. He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee. Mini opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking a big slug. \nMARTIN A phone call would have been appreciated at some point. I was worried. \nMINI (V.O.) Worried that refugee from a J.Lo video rode me `til the tires fell off? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Uh...Martin, I'm not sure you're aware, but at this point you can't be my dad and my lover. Where I go and how late I stay out is my business. \nMARTIN I wasn't saying that as a dad. (very sincere) Before your mother and I...grew apart, I would worry if she was out late. \nMINI Well, that's sweet, but I'm not her and I can assure you I won't end up passed out in some greaseball's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles... (cold, smooth) u nless I choose to. \n", "test2_id": 745, "test3_input": "He heads for the door again. \nMARTIN Now, if you'll excuse me... \nMini grabs him again, desperate. \nMINI Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really am, but this isn't the answer! \nMartin grabs her wrist, forcefully. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (7) \nMINI You're hurting me! \nMARTIN (through his teeth) Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me? \nMini nods her head. \nMARTIN Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you understand? \nMini nods again. \nMINI (softly) Please don't do this. \nHe lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard. Mini watches him go. \nEXT. RUDELL'S FRONT DOOR- MOMENTS LATER. \nMartin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's R \"Nice and Easy\" is playing on his stereo in the background. \nUDELL Martin, what a surprise, how are you? \nMARTIN Just watched Mini on your show. \nRUDELL Ahh...was tonight the night? We taped that two weeks ago. Let me tell you, I have girls audition all the time for me and... (enjoying this) She was fucking incredible. \nRudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction. \nMARTIN A natural, huh? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRUDELL Like a duck to water...and totally willing to take direction. \nMartin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife in him. \nRUDELL I wish all the girls I worked with had her...how can I put this?... Need to please. \nMARTIN You son of a bitch... \nMartin explodes, punching Rudell in the mouth, sending him staggering backwards inside. \nSINATRA (V.O.) \"Let's take it nice and easy...\" \nINT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone. She looks out THE WINDOW at the fight beginning in Rudell's house. \nMINI (frantic) Yes, hello, you've got to send a police car to 2376 Mira Loma Lane right away! My father's gone crazy, I think he's going to hurt our neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry! \nINT. RUDELL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face. \nSINATRA (V.O.) \"Hey, baby, what's your hurry? Relax, don't you worry...\" \nMartin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces. \nMartin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe rushes Martin, clubbing him in the head with it. Martin crumples to the floor and Rudell starts kicking him. Martin grabs Rudell by the ankles and flips him. \nThe two men grapple on the floor. \nMARTIN Where are they?! Huh? \nRUDELL What are you talk- \nMARTIN Don't fuck with me! The negatives! \nRUDELL What?! \nEXT. RUDELL'S PATIO AND POOL - CONTINUOUS \nRudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green. \n", "test3_true": "Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes. Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another. \nSINATRA (V.O.) \"To rush would be a crime...\" \nRudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after another. \nMARTIN You son of a bitch! How's that feel?! You like that?! You thought you could have my wife and my daughter too?! \nSINATRA (V.O.) \"`Cause nice and easy does it, nice and easy does it...\" \nMartin bends down and grabs Rudell's hair, twisting his head around so he can look him in the eye. In the distance a SIREN is heard getting closer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Sorry, pal, she's mine! Diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas, but not her! Not her! \nMartin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising it with both hands above his head for a final swing. M ARTIN Now tell me where they are or I swear to god, I'll crack your head open! \nMINI (O.S.) Martin, don't! \nHe turns around to see Mini, tears coming down her cheeks, standing ten feet away. The SIRENS suddenly stop. \nMARTIN Go look for the negatives! \nMINI No! This is insane! \nMARTIN We need the negatives! \nHe raises the club again. Mini runs for him, grabbing his arm before it comes down. \nMINI You're gonna kill him! \nHe tries to pull the club away. \nMARTIN What are you doing! He'll tell everyone! \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Freeze, police! \nMartin turns around to see TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS with their guns drawn. Martin looks down at Rudell, gasping for air, his face covered in blood. He looks at his own blood-soaked clothes, the reality hitting him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nOFFICER Drop the club and put your hands up! \nMartin obeys and Mini runs into the arms of the second officer. The first one moves quickly to Martin and shoves him on the ground. \nMINI Thank God! Thank God, you came! \nMARTIN Mini, you called them?! How could you call them?! \nMini buries her face in the officer's chest. \nMINI He's...he's crazy, I told him not to! I told him to stop! \nSINATRA (V.O.) \"Nice and easy does it...every time.\" \nFADE OUT: \nEXT. THE FRONT OF A POLICE STATION - DAY \nMini emerges from the station with her lawyer as a throng of REPORTERS jostle for a photo. \nMINI (V.O.) Needless to say, my appearance on Absolutely Positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town. \nTV VIDEO FOOTAGE OF: Mini at Martin's trial sitting in the front row. \nMINI (V.O.) The trial was quick. Once Mom's affair with Rudell came out, the D.A. realized he had a motive and a slam dunk. T HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye towards Martin and then reads the verdict. \nFOREWOMAN Guilty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMartin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs behind him. \nMINI (V.O.) Since, Rudell was in a coma, the issue of my relationship with Martin was moot. Martin realized trying to pin anything on me would probably get him the chair. \nEXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY \nMartin, wearing an ORANGE PRISON UNIFORM, is led into a van by a DEPUTY. \nMINI (V.O.) At his sentencing I begged for leniency. He got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life for mom's death. \nEXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn, snapping photos. Dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up next to the front door. \nMINI (V.O.) The outpouring of support was amazing. \n", "test3_id": 746}

{"test1_input": "CONTINUED: \nMARTIN I mean, I don't want to live under the same roof with her. \nCLOSE ON: \nA FEW RAIN DROPS HITTING THE ROOF OF THE CAR. \nMINI You can't leave, she'll get half. \nMartin exhales, knowing she's right. \nMINI Can I ask how the hell you married her without a pre-nup? Her? \nMARTIN (sighing) She wasn't as bad an actress as you think. \nMINI Well, there is another option. \nTHE RAIN PICKS UP, PLINK, PLUNKING ON THE ROOF. \nMARTIN There is? \nHer eyes harden as she looks out at the city. \nMINI But it will take some planning... and some resolve. \nMartin's eyes suddenly widen. \nMARTIN Wait, you don't mean- \nMINI Kill her? \nShe lets the word linger, as the rain beats down steadily. \nMINI No, of course not, she is my mother. \nMARTIN Good... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI But I've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill- \nMARTIN Ill? \nMINI Unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs. \nMartin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right. Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips.            M ARTIN It would be for her own good. \nMINI The only truly caring action we could take. \nMARTIN As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife. \nMINI You did it for the well being of your daughter. The selfless act of a devoted parent. \nThe sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips. \nMARTIN Of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented. \nShe responds in kind, tilting her head. \nMINI And corroborated by friends and people outside the family. \nMARTIN A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI No, that would be useful. \nTheir lips are now almost touching. \nMARTIN And we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country. \nMINI With lots of fresh air. \nMARTIN It will be a much better life for her. \nMINI Much. \nUnable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each other's clothes. \nEXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS \nThe car rocks gently back and forth in the rain, as another car whizzes by, spray flying up behind it as it disappears around a curve. \nINT. MINI'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nMini wakes up with a look of pure joy, ready to face the world. \nMINI (V.O.) I awoke the next morning, as excited as I could remember. Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this would take determination... \n", "test1_true": "Mini swims on her back in the pool, a lit cigarette dangling between her lips. \nMINI (V.O.) Stamina... \nINT. THEIR KITCHEN - MORNING \nMini and Martin sit together, eating breakfast. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) And imagination. \nDiane storms through the living room in the background, passing out of sight, behind the door frame. M MINI (V.O.) I decided to start simply. \nDIANE Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it! \nMINI (V.O.) Part one, violent mood swings- slash-uncontrollable rages. \nCushions from the living room couch fly past the door frame. \nDIANE Fucking shit! Where are they? \nMini stirs her coffee innocently. Diane again can be seen through the door, this time throwing magazines and papers off the coffee table. \nDIANE I'm gonna be late! It took me three weeks to get an appointment with Anton... \nMINI (V.O.) Anton Michelle, masseuse to the stars and reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town. Rumor has it, he's pouring the pork to every rich wife between Malibu and Pasadena. He must be incredible if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this early. \nDIANE ...and now I'm gonna miss it because I can't find my fucking car keys?! \nMartin and Mini exchange a smirk. She turns towards them, eyes ablaze. \nDIANE I could use a little help in here! \nMartin looks up from his morning paper as cheerful as can be. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARTIN Coming, honey. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMini and Martin walk in to see Diane on all fours, looking under one of the sofas. Her panties are blatantly visible from under her mini-skirt. Mini and Martin exchange a smirk. \nMARTIN Diane, sugar, do you remember where you put them when you came home last night? \nDIANE Yeah, in the fucking bowl by the fucking door where I always fucking put them! \nMINI Well, uh, you were kinda out of it last night. \nDIANE No, I wasn't! I had one drink with Marie, one! \nMARTIN Uh, are you sure? You did seem a bit tipsy. \nDIANE Yes, I'm sure, you dickless wonder. D iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a desk near the front door. \nMINI (under her breath) Now don't you listen to her, you are not a dickless wonder. \nMartin tries not to let on how much he's enjoying this. Completely frustrated, Diane stops looking and heads for the \"key\" bowl by the door. \nDIANE Mini, I'm taking your car. Martin, take her to school. \nDiane grabs a set of keys. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Diane, I have a meeting with Chapman, he's our biggest client-- \nDIANE (opening the door) Tell him it's an emergency. \nShe slams the door behind her. Mini looks at Martin with a sly grin then removes a cell phone from her pocket and dials a number. As she waits for an answer, she twirls DIANE'S KEY RING around her finger. \nMINI (V.O.) Now, here comes the really fun part. I realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit I could do a passable job imitating... \nMINI (mimicking Diane) Hello, Anton? It's Diane Tannen, I know it's late notice, but I'm going to have to cancel our appointment. What? No, of course, I realize I'll still have to pay...yes, something came up. \nINT. THE \"OFFICE\" OF ANTON MICHELLE - LATER. \nANTON MICHELLE, 30, the very muscular \"it boy\" masseuse is furiously fucking JEANETTE LANG, a similarly hyper- aerobicized wife, on his massage table. \nHe's bent her over the table and is taking her from behind when, suddenly, the door flies open. They both look up to see...DIANE with a stunned expression. \nDIANE Anton? But...Jeanette? \nJEANETTE Uh...hi, Diane? \nANTON (french accent) But, Mrs. Tannen, you call and cancel zee session thirty meenutes ago?       D IANE What? No, I didn't! \n", "test1_id": 744, "test2_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nANTON Yes, I spoke to you myself, you say sometheeng come up. \nDiane looks at Jeanette, her eyes narrowing. \nDIANE Jeanette, you knew I had an appointment today, did you pretend- \nJEANETTE (flustered) No, I, I ...Anton called me and told me he had a cancellation. \nANTON Yes, I call her after you call me. \nJeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around herself. \nDIANE Why, you sneaky little bitch! \nSuddenly, Diane LUNGES for Jeanette, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her off the table. Jeannette shrieks as Anton struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S DINING ROOM - EVENING \nDiane sits at the table with her arm in a sling. Martin cuts her meat for her, as Mini pours her some red wine. \nMINI (V.O.) Needless to say, word of the L'incid\u00e9nt de Anton spread quickly through the community. \nMINI Do you think she'll press charges? \nDIANE Are you kidding? She should get twenty to life! When I told Margo and Penny about her little stunt, they both said they'd have ripped her eyes out. She'll be lucky if anyone speaks to her again. \nMartin holds up a forkful of food. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN Here comes the choo-choo. \nDiane grabs the fork with her good hand. \nDIANE For god's sake, I didn't break both hands. \nMINI Jeez, I still can't believe you broke your hand on her face? It's so Linda Hamilton. \nDIANE (slugging some wine) I hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed. \nINT. THE ROSA ANGELICA FLOWER SHOP - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON: The store's owner, CARLOS, 50, picking up the RINGING PHONE. \nCARLOS R osa Angelica, this is Carlos. \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) \nHello, Carlos, it's Diane Tannen calling. \nCARLOS Ah, s\u00ed, Senora Tannen, como esta? \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) (annoyed) Uh, Carlos...english, comprende? \nCARLOS (taken aback) Okay. \nMINI IMPERSONATING DIANE (O.S.) I'm going to need a delivery to the house. \nEXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAY \nA \"MOONWALK\" INFLATABLE CARNIVAL RIDE is being inflated on the front lawn by a WORKER, as TWO JUGGLERS warm up next to it, tossing clubs between them. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) Phase two: wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state. \nFIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF BOUQUETS and ARRANGEMENTS line the driveway. Mini stands outside next to Carlos, sucking on a lollipop. \nMINI Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers. \nCARLOS Your mother said you are having a big party! \nMINI (innocently) I know, can you believe all this? \nJust then, Diane's Jaguar pulls into the driveway. She looks at the trucks, her expression souring. She stops the car and flies out. \nDIANE Carlos, what the hell is going on? \nCARLOS Senora Tannen, the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party? \nDIANE Ordered, I didn't order anything?! Who told you to bring these here? \nCARLOS (flustered) But, but, Senora, you did, you called me, I talked to you. \nDIANE No, you didn't! \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2)      CARLOS(CONT'D) You were very excited, saying you were going to have the most wonderful party and invite everyone you knew and it had to be just perfect. Perfect, that's what you said.     M INI Mom, is that what you were talking about yesterday? \nDIANE What?! \nMINI Well, it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine. You mumbled something about a party before you took a nap. \nDIANE No, I did not! \nMINI (wincing) Mom, you did. The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol. \nDIANE But, but...I only slept for-- \nMINI (to Carlos) I am so sorry. Listen, we'll pay, don't worry. \nMini leads Carlos back to his vans, just Martin's Mercedes pulls up. Diane turns around to see his car and a look of dread strikes her. \nDIANE Oh, god. \nMINI (V.O.) Right on cue. Let's see how convincing he is. \nMartin gets out of the car, surveying the damage. A look of pure indignant outrage overcomes him and it's impossible to tell this is an act. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMARTIN What is going on?! Carlos, what the fuck are all these flowers doing here?! \nMINI (V.O.) Oooh, now I see why he makes the big bucks. \nCARLOS Se\u00f1or Tannen, we-- \nDIANE Uh, Martin, I, I... \nMARTIN Diane, did you order all this?! \nMINI Mom, go inside, just go, I'll handle him. (trying to calm him) It's under control, Dad. Please, let's not make a scene. \nMONTAGE: \n-Mini opens the front door to find A DELIVERY VAN from WATERFORD CRYSTAL pull up. \nMINI (V.O.) Over the next few days, whenever Mom had passed out from too much drinky-drinky... \n-The door opens again as A FURRIER holding a full length mink coat stands before her with a big smile on his face. \nMINI (V.O.) I'd pull out her wallet... \n-A SALESMAN dangling the keys to a FORD MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE which is parked behind him in the driveway. M MINI (V.O.) ...and reach out and touch someone. \n-A FLATBED TRUCK hauling a 30 FOOT SAILBOAT behind it pulls up in front of the house. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nMINI (V.O.) It's really remarkable what you can order with a Platinum card these days. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nA strung out Diane sits on the couch, smoking and nursing a Vodka tonic. THE DOORBELL rings and Diane reacts like a dog in a thunderstorm, a jolt of fear coursing through her body. \nMINI (V.O.) Talk about easy. After a week of my version of the home shopping network, the doorbell might as well have been a canon. \nDiane gets up and walks unsteadily towards the front door. \nINT. A CLASS ROOM AT MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nMini and Kayla sit in a history class, looking dreamily at their teacher, WARREN BISHOP, 25, an earnest young preppy in the middle of a lecture. \nMINI (V.O.) At this point, dear old mummy was so spooked, I was actually afraid she might stop drinking. So I needed a back up plan, to keep her...off-balance. \nBISHOP As we see from a closer examination of the facts, Abraham Lincoln's decision to... \nBishop's voice fades out as he continues to speak. \nMINI (V.O.) Now, here's someone I'd like to make sit, roll over and then toss me his snausage. But today... priorities are priorities. \nMini raises her hand. \nMINI Mr. Bishop, can I go to the little girls room? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBISHOP Of course, Mini. \nINT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nMini walks down the empty corridor. \n", "test2_id": 745, "test3_input": "MINI Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home and tell everyone we're a couple? We'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers. \nMartin stops and looks at her, surprised. \nMINI Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward? \nHis face turns a little red. \nMINI I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration. \nMartin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed. \nMARTIN You realize he could blackmail us? If the police found out about us, that suicide wouldn't look so routine. \nMINI Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing is going to happen. \nHer words don't appear to have calmed him. \nEXT. THE POOL - DAY \nMartin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini. \nMINI (V.O.) The next few days were a laugh riot. \nMartin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously. Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth. He instinctively pulls back. \nMINI (V.O.) Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was my father. \nJust then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the difference. \nINT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels, stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes M channels. Mini looks very annoyed. \nMINI (V.O.) We returned home and things didn't get much better. \nMONTAGE: \nMini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror: \n-Catholic School girl. \nMINI (V.O.) What little sex we were having    was getting dull. \n-Cheerleader. \nMINI (V.O.) Quite frankly, with my little project successfully completed... \n-Naughty Nurse. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI (V.O.) I was bored. I became concerned that in my world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first... \n-French Maid. \nMINI (V.O.) ...at too young an age. \n-Marilyn Monroe in the sequined dress she sang to JFK in. \nMINI (singing breathily) \"Happy birthday, Mr. President\" \nMINI (V.O.) As for school, well, I was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mother's death. \nTHE DOOR BELL RINGS. Mini looks towards the hallway. \nEXT. THE FRONT DOOR TO THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER. \nMini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in the sequined dress. Detective Garson stands at the door, looking her up and down. Mini hides her surprise well. \nMINI (V.O.) Uh oh. \nMINI Yes? \nGARSON Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I don't know if you remember me? \nMINI Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And \"yes\", I remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm. \nGARSON (ignoring her dig) So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMINI Nice work, McGruff. \nGARSON Again, I am sorry about that night, but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible. \nMINI What do you want? \nGARSON I need to ask you a few more questions about your mother's death.    M INI Sure, come on in. \n", "test3_true": "Mini leads him in. \nMINI (V.O.) I know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but I didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation? I could feel something tingle deep inside. \nMini and Garson take a seat. Mini lights a cigarette. Garson looks over her outfit again. \nGARSON It's a little early for the prom, isn't it? \nMINI A girl can dream, can't she? \nGARSON Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report. Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust. \nMINI Is it that important? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGARSON Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods. Her choices seemed, I don't know how to put it... improvisational. \nMINI Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her? She clearly put some thought into that outfit. \nGARSON Clearly...But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out. \nMINI I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them. \nGARSON I suppose you're right...Also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer. \nMINI Really? \nGARSON Any idea why she'd call 911? \nMINI (V.O.) Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing I've done in a while, but even I know when the rush isn't worth the risk. \nMINI Look, I think you should come back when my father's around. He'll be upset I let a stranger in the house.    G ARSON I think you're safe with me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMINI Even so, he won't be happy. \nGARSON Not a problem, will he be home tonight? \nINT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nMartin is on the phone. \nMARTIN And you let him in?! \nEXT. THE POOL - CONTINUOUS \nMini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone, while sucking on a red popsicle. \nMINI I played it cool, it would've looked worse to be defensive. \nMini looks across the yard to see... \nMIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are locked on hers. \nMARTIN (V.O.) Well, when's he coming over? \nMINI Tonight? \nMARTIN (V.O.) Tonight!? I've got a dinner with Chapman. I've already cancelled-- (frustrated) Damn it! Why didn't you call me?! \nRUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze, revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good shape for a man his age. \nMINI (annoyed) Hey, I didn't know you had plans! \nMini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her bikini top. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN (V.O.) Listen, I'll be home early so we can get the story straight. \nMINI Okay. \nMini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth. \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nMartin and Mini sit across from Garson. Martin appears cool and relaxed, a scotch in his hand. \nGARSON I really appreciate you taking the time to help us out. There's just a few loose ends we want to tie up. \nMARTIN Absolutely. What would you like to know? \nGarson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts G leafing through papers. \nARSON There appears to be some question as to the time of death. You said you went to dinner and a movie- \n", "test3_id": 746}

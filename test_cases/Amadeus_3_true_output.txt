CONSTANZE She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you. 
MOZART Oh, damn! 
INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -  DAY - 1780'S 
Mozart comes out. Framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid we noticed in Salieri's house. From his bedroom Leopold peeps out to watch. Mozart goes to the girl. Constanze follows. 
MOZART Yes? 
LORL Are you Herr Mozart? 
MOZART That's right. 
LORL My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you. 
MOZART What? 
LORL They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous. 
CONSTANZE What do you mean? What admirer? 
LORL I can't tell you that, ma'am. 
MOZART Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is? 
LORL Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish. 
Mozart turns to his father. 
MOZART Papa, is this your idea? 
LEOPOLD Mine? 
The old man emerges from his bedroom. His son looks at him delightedly. 
MOZART Are you playing a trick on me? 
LEOPOLD I never saw this girl in my life. (to Lorl) Is this a kind of joke? 
LORL Not at all, sir. And I was told to wait for an answer. 
LEOPOLD Young woman, this won't do at all. My son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it. 
LORL But I really can't tell you, sir. 
LEOPOLD Oh, this is ridiculous. 
CONSTANZE What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time. 
LEOPOLD But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of! 
CONSTANZE Well, this is none of your business. (to Lorl) Whoever sent you is going to pay, no? 
LORL That's right, ma'am. 
LEOPOLD So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house? 
Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl. 
CONSTANZE Who is we? Who is letting who? (to Lorl) Could you please wait outside? 
LORL Yes, ma'am. 
Lorl goes outside and closes the door. Constanze turns on Leopold. 
CONSTANZE Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can - 
MOZART Stanzi! 
CONSTANZE No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we? 
LEOPOLD Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving! 
MOZART Papa! 
LEOPOLD Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden. 
MOZART No one calls you that. 
LEOPOLD She does. She says I sleep all day. 
CONSTANZE And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat. 
LEOPOLD And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day? 
CONSTANZE Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper! 
LEOPOLD So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time. 
CONSTANZE (to Mozart) Do you hear him? Do you? 
Explosively she opens the door. 
CONSTANZE (to Lorl) When can you start? 
LORL Right away, ma'am. 
CONSTANZE Good! Come in. You'll start with that room there. (indicating Leopold's room) It's filthy! 
She leads the maid into Leopold's room. Mozart steals back into his workroom and gently closes the door. Leopold is left alone. 
LEOPOLD Sorry, sorry! I'm sorry I spoke! I'm just a provincial from Salzburg. What do I know about smart Vienna? Parties all night, every night. Dancing and drinking like idiot children! 
INT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - DAY - 1780'S 
Mozart stands trying to blot out the noise of his father's shouting from the next room. 
LEOPOLD (O.S.) Dinner at eight! Dinner at ten! Dinner when anyone feels like it! If anyone feels like it! 
The ensemble of Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi from Act IV of Figaro resumes, coming to his aid and rising to greet the listener with its serene harmonies. Relieved, Mozart languidly picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table: he is sucked back into his own world of sound.

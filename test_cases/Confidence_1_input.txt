CONTINUED: LILY How do you know I will? JAKE Intuition. CUT TO: INT.- LILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Illuminated only by the light coming from the windows... Jake runs a hand down the length of Lily's bare back. She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss. Lily's hand moves down Jake's arm until it finds his hand. LILY You have really soft hands.    Like a baby's. JAKE (remembering the King) Don't ruin this for me. They roll off the bed onto the floor, a naked tangle of arms and legs, their hands still entwined. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY NIGHT (PRESENT) Jake takes a deep breath, Butch and Lily behind him. BUTCH Is that what it was, Jake?    Was it love? JAKE You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden. Lily looks away, her face softening for a moment. JAKE Then she fucked him over with an apple. (with a dry laugh) Redheads... Jake continues to LAUGH... CUT TO: 
INT . - LILY'S APARTMENT--DAY Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum-pit studio apartment. Jake lies next to Lily, kissing her neck. A spoon RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing subway train. The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening volume. Jake's a little alarmed.   Lily, oblivious. JAKE (drowned out by the rumble) How do you deal with--- LILY (yelling) WHAT? JAKE (yelling back) SAID, HOW DO-- (the subway passes) Deal with that? Lily shrugs indifferently. LILY Do you think we can do it? Jake resumes kissing Lily's neck, trying to rekindle some of last night's magic. JAKE Maybe. Even if we don't, you'll be alright. You're not in the hole with the King. Lily rolls away from Jake.   Undaunted, Jake starts kissing her back. LILY Who says you have to know the King to be in a whole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper. JAKE Sounds respectable. LILY Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. (MORE)

CONTINUED: LILY (CONT'D) I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something. JAKE You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now? Jake, kissing up the length of Lily's neck. LILY He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that. JAKE Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me. LILY We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird. JAKE You guys got busted.   This is a great neck. Jake still kissing... LILY No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him. (pause) What the hell was his name? JAKE Glenn talked you out of it. LILY Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but...

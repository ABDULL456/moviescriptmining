PHELPS Thank you. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT 
The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party at the Embassy tonight. 
INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's looking for -- 
-- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of the elevator shaft. 
PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. 
PHELPS Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by twenty-three hundred. 
INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair that's in full swing on the second floor. 
SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo hurries up to him. 
DIPLOMAT How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just steer you through the reception line here 
The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. 
DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the director of the National Gallery -- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- 
SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with WALTZER. 
SARAH I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? 
SENATOR WALTZER Of course I do.  How are you, Miss Norman? 
He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so SARAH whispers something in his ear. 
SARAH He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. 
Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. 
The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. 
UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, 
ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from outside. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks into his microphone. 
PHELPS Sarah, mark the package and go to two. 
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT 
SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. 
SARAH Your advance team mentioned you'd want a tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead and set that up for you -- 
SENATOR WALTZER Terrific.  Let's get going. (to the Diplomat) Will you excuse us? 
He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads further into the Embassy. 
DIPLOMAT Uh, sir? 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above him descending. 
JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him to the wall.

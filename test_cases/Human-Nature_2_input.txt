FIRST DRAFT 
BLACKNESS. 
There is a gunshot. A crow screams. A fluttering of wings. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest. 
Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF LILA TALKING TO THE CAMERA 
LILA I'm not sorry. 
A bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding flash of light obliterates her face. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF PUFF TALKING TO THE CAMERA 
PUFF I am sorry. 
A tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another blinding flash of light. 
CUT TO: 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NATHAN TALKING TO THE CAMERA 
NATHAN I don't even know what sorry means anymore. 
As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of light. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
A ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls. 
Beat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth. 
LILA I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest of my life in jail. So what? I've been in jail my whole life anyway. A jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones... 
One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. 
It's going to be a long night. 
LILA ...a jail called the human body. 
The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference to "human body." 
LILA My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. A bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back... 
The lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now.

HALE 
(TURNING) Look, I -- 
TERRY (not interested) Gimme your hands. Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them. 
HALE I'm going to tell you something I can't tell you. Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching him off. 
HALE There were nuclear weapons on that plane. The guy I was flying with is trying to steal them. Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving. 
HALE I have to stop him, and I need your help. 
TERRY 
(STOPS) Look, pal, all I know is, I saw you come down, I come in to help you and you grab me, kick me and run away. 
HALE I only ran because you punched me. 
TERRY What, we're ten years old now? "You started it. No you started it." 
HALE He has men on the ground. I -- 
TERRY Save it. My dog's waiting for his breakfast. Terry starts to push Hale along again and... 
HALE Jumps up and through the handcuffs. 
TERRY Reaches for her revolver, but... 
HALE Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before... 
TERRY Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin. 
HALE AND TERRY Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath. 
HALE This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've got a gun. 
TERRY Yeah, well, I never keep my gun loaded. Terry taps her belt. 
CLOSE ON HER BELT A line of bullets. 
HALE AND TERRY Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on his finger. Just as Terry takes it... 
HALE Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her knife hand, putting the knife to her throat. 
HALE I'm telling you the truth. 
TERRY This is a good way to convince me. 
HALE I could kill you now. Right? Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared. Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife. 
HALE I need your help. Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt. 
INT./EXT. HELICOPTER 
The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap. 
ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots appear on the outer edge of the screen. 
RHODES Got 'em! 
EXT. CANYONLANDS 
Terry unlocks Hale's handcuffs. 
TERRY I've got a radio in the truck. We can call McMurran and get the Marines in here.

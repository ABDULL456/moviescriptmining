ANWAR Yes sir, this is my house. 
Richard tries to carry Susan, but she screams in pain. 
RICHARD Easy, darling, easy... 
He slips his hands under her and lifts her up. 
SUSAN Don't touch me there. 
Richard moves his hand, which is covered in blood. As he carries her, he turns into the aisle while Anwar and one of the passengers try to help him. 
65   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY 
Richard carries her into the house through a crowd of curious children. 
66   INT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Anwar leads Richard down the hallways amidst Susan's screams. 
67   EXT. PATIO, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
They walk through a dusty patio and Anwar points at some stairs. Richard climbs them with difficulty and Anwar opens the door to a room. 
ANWAR Here... here... 
68   INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
An old woman (87), Anwar's grandmother, who has centuries of desert in her expression, lets them in and points at a rug on the floor. 
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Put her there... 
Richard understands and softly lays Susan on the rug. Susan looks around horrified: adobe walls, dirt floor: the epitome of the third world. 
RICHARD I need to call an ambulance and contact my embassy. 
ANWAR If you have the number of the embassy, I can go call. 
Obviously, Richard does not have it. 
RICHARD I need to make a phone call. 
ANWAR Of course, come with me. 
They get ready to leave and Susan starts imploring. 
SUSAN Don't leave me here alone... 
RICHARD Don't worry, I'll be right back. 
Susan looks desperate. To set Richard somewhat at ease, Anwar points at his Grandmother. 
ANWAR She can take care of her. 
Richard leans over Susan. 
RICHARD You're going to be ok. 
Anwar kneels down next to her, takes a cloth and improvises a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder. He turns towards the grandmother. 
ANWAR (In Arabic) Hold and release the tourniquet every once in a while. 
The grandmother nods. She sees the swarm of kids looking into the place and she shoos them away. 
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER (In Arabic) Get out of here... out... 
The kids obey, except for one or two who take one last look before they go. Susan's terrified eyes watch Anwar and Richard leave the room. 
69   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
The bus is still parked in front of the house. As soon as Richard walks out, the pensioners approach him. 
DOUGLAS How is your wife? 
RICHARD Bad. Very bad. 
Tom (51), a fat English passenger, faces him. 
TOM Get her outta there and let's go. 
RICHARD And where should I take her? 
TOM In Egypt, in a town like this, they slit thirty German tourists' throats. They might do the same to us. 
Anwar listens and intervenes. 
ANWAR No, not here. 
TOM (Aggressively) What do you know? We have to get out of here as soon as possible. 
Lilly (79), an old woman, approaches. 
LILLY It's very hot, sir, and the driver turned off the air conditioning. I'm feeling sick. 
RICHARD You can't leave us here. 
James (82), Lilly's husband, steps forward. 
JAMES What's the use in staying? 
RICHARD In case I need the bus. 
JAMES They can go drop us off and then come back for you. 
Douglas (75), a tall old man with good posture, interjects.

PENELOPE What was it? 
SHUTTLE He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon. 
Blackout. 
SCENE THREE 
DARKNESS.  Lights come up on living room.  WOODLY is alone, asleep on the couch. 
HAROLD lets himself and LOOSELEAF in through the front door--quietly.  HAROLD has a full beard and a paunch. LOOSELEAF is skinnier.  He has a handlebar moustache.  Both wear new sports clothes and smoke expensive cigars.  HAROLD is calm.  LOOSELEAF is nervous, confused.  They prowl the room cautiously, checking this and that.  HAROLD awakens WOODLY by playing with his feet. 
WOODLY (startled) Ooops. 
HAROLD (to LOOSELEAF, very amused) Ooops. 
WOODLY Can I--uh--help you gentlemen? 
HAROLD (moving downstage, feeling at home) Gentlemen--that's nice. 
WOODLY (to LOOSELEAF) You startled me. 
LOOSELEAF Yeah.  We just got here. 
WOODLY I thought you might be burglars-- but you're not, I hope. 
LOOSELEAF Nope. (idiotically, incapable of deception) I got a lot of stuff. 
WOODLY (looking at him closely) You do? 
HAROLD The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked? 
WOODLY It's always locked. 
HAROLD But here you are inside, aren't you? 
WOODLY You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan? 
HAROLD We tried to be.  We tried to be. 
WOODLY He's dead, you know. 
HAROLD Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead! (to LOOSELEAF) Did you hear that? 
LOOSELEAF Yup. 
Telephone rings.  WOODLY answers, keeping his eyes on the bizarre guests. 
WOODLY Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother. 
HAROLD (to LOOSELEAF) Hello, Mother. 
WOODLY ...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear. 
HAROLD Oh dear. 
WOODLY Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now. 
He hangs up, faces the intruders. 
WOODLY Look--I'm sorry--I have to go. 
HAROLD We'll miss you so. 
WOODLY Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while. 
HAROLD Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.

SAME - LATER 
Molto tied to a tree. Elias is giving him instructions while, strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks. 
ELIAS (to Molto) Disce a Senor Guzman que... (his Spanish isn't good enough) ...that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town. We'll know how to reach him. Okay? 
Molto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind. 
EXT./INT. A PARKING GARAGE/INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING 
The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, "Hey, Frank." Frank waves him in. 
The garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations. 
ELIAS Approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills, it's somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars. Right back there. 
As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head through the open window. Elias finishes his money report, and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but: 
ELIAS (continuing; not turning around) Think I'm crazy? 
HULL Yes. (blowing up, gun still on him) I can't believe you got us into this. All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses, including Renaldo Guzman who's friends with fucking George Bush. 
ELIAS I know they're coming after us. I want them to. We'll give them the money, but we'll make a deal for ourselves. We'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs. I've thought it all out. I've been thinking it out for years. 
Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias turns around, embraces him. 
ELIAS (continuing) We're going to have everything. Don't you want everything, John? 
HULL They're going to get your family, David. They'll kill your wife and daughter. 
ELIAS (serene) Nancy and Miranda left the country two days ago. 
HULL You knew about this then? 
Elias smiles. 
HULL (continuing) What about Betty? 
EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY SHOP - EVENING 
A car SQUEALS to a stop. Molto and three thugs smash through the glass door. They disappear into the store where things can be heard BREAKING. They emerge a moment later, jump into the car. 
EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING 
Hull's car races up. He jumps out, dashes toward the building. 
INT. SYNAGOGUE SOCIAL HALL - EVENING 
Forty PEOPLE on folding chairs. Hull enters on a dead run. He stops short when he sees: 
BETTY 
at the front. He signals to her, but she's already saying: 
MCCUTCHEON Hi, my name is Betty. 
EVERYONE IN THE ROOM Hi, Betty! 
MCCUTCHEON My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict. And I've been clean for nineteen days. 
The room bursts into APPLAUSE. She sees Hull at the back; he signals to her, but she goes on. 
MCCUTCHEON (continuing) I've been using drugs and selling them, and I've wanted to stop for a long time, and the only way I did was because I met a man I loved and who loved me. I know that's not what I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to say there was a higher power, and maybe there was, behind it all, but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that I could start, or at least think about a life that didn't have drugs in it... 
She's looking right at Hull as she speaks. He's torn between the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's saying. 
EXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING 
Hull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting. 
MCCUTCHEON I've got to get clothes. 
HULL You can't go back. 
INT. HULL'S CONDO - EVENING 
Molto and men pouring through it. In frustration, Molto smashes the table Hull had fussed over when Elias put his feet up.

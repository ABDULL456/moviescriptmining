But as he tries to enter Creasy's room, he's met in the door by TWO THUG COPS, in uniform. 
COP ONE No visitors. 
Cop two pokes a finger into Rayburn's chest. 
COP TWO Who are you? 
RAYBURN I'm here to see my friend. 
Cop two pokes him again.     Goading him. 
COP TWO Identification. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     69. 
Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO PLAINCLOTHES. 
Ignoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn. 
MANZANO When I heard it was this hospital I was so pleased. There's a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it? 
Rayburn shakes his head. 
MANZANO The best pastries in Mexico. 
Manzano holds out his right hand. 
MANZANO (CONT'D) Miguel Manzano. 
INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY 
Creasy out of it still.    Rayburn and Manzano at the foot of the bed. 
RAYBURN He's not a cop killer. 
MANZANO I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing. 
RAYBURN He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him. 
MANZANO So am I. 
And Creasy stirs.   Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano just behind him. 
RAYBURN You hear me, Crease? 
Creasy's eyes slit open. 
RAYBURN (CONT'D) (whispers) You got three of the fuckers.   All dead. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     70. 
CREASY Pinta... 
RAYBURN Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom. 
MANZANO These things take time, Mr. Creasy. 
Creasy closes his eyes.

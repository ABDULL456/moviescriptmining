DONATELLO You are such a Neanderthal. Raphael does the bully FAKE LUNGE at Don. Don reacts quick and startled, eyes wide. 
APHAEL I rest my case. 
S 
PLINTER 
(SCOLDING) Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with. 
APHAEL (gritted teeth) Yes, sensei. (to Mikey) And quit touchin' my stuff. Raph yanks the Ring Blades out of Mikey's hands and storms out of the room by flipping up a series of cables to the second floor. 
DONATELLO (too-late-retort to Raph) That was just a startle response and isn't really an indication of fear! Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC... ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song. 
RAPHAEL (O.S.) 
AAAARGH! AND STOP TOUCHING MY 
STEREO TOO, MIKEY!!! Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing to drown out his family. A silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of Raph's room. Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other two. 
DONATELLO It's an involuntary thing your body does when stimulated like that. (no response) What? It's true. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT 
A large JET LINER flies into the city. Lowering. The wheels fold out under the carriages. CLOSER - LEO is on the landing gear, his face lit up by the city glow in front of him. He jumps off as - FOOMP! - a HANG- GLIDER opens up from his backpack. He lowers the glider to the water and RELEASES! 
INT. SEWER PIPE - MOMENTS LATER 
Disgusting. Dripping. Out of the slime, Leo rises. A beat... inhales, then SMILES WIDE. 
LEONARDO Mmm... home sweet home. 
INT. TURTLES LAIR - NIGHT 
All is peaceful in the lair. The big screen TV is the only light source. Mikey snores and drools on the couch, covered in junk food wrappers. Donnie sleeps with an "TECH HEAD" magazine over his face... gadget-in-process in his lap. ON ENTRANCE - Leo walks in and places his bag on the floor. The place feels different... but still feels like home. 
S 
He tiptoes with ninjitsu precision across the floor, avoiding the potential noise-making mess below him. He sneaks to- 
INT. SPLINTER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Leo peers in cautiously. Splinter is still awake. Expecting him. Kneeling on the floor. Very serious. 
SPLINTER Enter. Leo walks in and kneels in front of Splinter. 
LEONARDO I have completed my training, master. I am prepared for the next stage. 
SPLINTER That you are, my son. You must now apply all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life. THAT will be the most challenging training of all... plinter reaches out and hands Leonardo an ANCIENT MEDALLION. Leo is touched. CLOSE ON SHADOWS OUTSIDE OF ROOM - We see a pair of EYES, watching the entire scene... jealous. 
SPLINTER I've missed you, Leonardo. 
L eo hugs Splinter. 
LEONARDO I've missed you too, father. 
SPLINTER I'm afraid much has changed in your brothers' spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been lacking. The family needs you. ON LEO - He swallows that big pill very hard. 
LEONARDO Heh. Yeah... I mean, yes sensei.

CURTIS (into the phone) No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. Curtis clicks off the phone. 
SAMANTHA What are you doing? Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance. Samantha speaks, her voice trembling. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Baby what's goin' on? 
EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT 
The ambulance lights splash across the house. Curtis escorts TWO EMTs down the front walk. He favors his left leg, walking with a slight limp. 
CURTIS I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out. 
EMT It's what we do. Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth. 
CURTIS Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday. 
EMT All right. 
CURTIS Thanks. Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches. 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his mouth. It burns. He spits into the kitchen sink. Samantha sits at the table watching him. Concerned, scared. She holds a balled up tissue in her hand. Curtis takes a seat across the table. She waits for him to say something. 
CURTIS I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry. 
SAMANTHA What's goin' on? 
CURTIS I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. Samantha listens with a furrowed brow. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm. 
(MORE) 
CURTIS (CONT'D) And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm. 
SAMANTHA That's why you put him out back? 
CURTIS Yeah. 
SAMANTHA What was the dream? Tonight. 
CURTIS It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. This makes Samantha look up. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. The room is quiet. Samantha watches her husband.

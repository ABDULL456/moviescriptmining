Have a nice day. \nWelles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is leaving, but stops at the end of the counter. \nWELLES What are you reading? \nMax holds up the book, \"ANAL SECRETARY.\" \nMAX Once you pick it up you can't put it down. \nWELLES Catchy title.  What are you really reading? (off Max's look) Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting. \nMax takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of the book and shows it to Welles.  \"Music for Chameleons.\" \nWELLES Truman Capote. \nMAX I tear off the cover and paste this one on... (nods towards clerk) You know how it is. \nWELLES Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts. \nMAX (smiles, shrugs) Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be? \nAnother CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register. Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles is at a table, porn publications spread out before him, looking through the back of a PORNO TABLOID... \nTurning pages of HARDCORE ADVERTISEMENTS: \"Adults Only,\" \"She Male Films,\" \"Amateur Sex Videos,\" \"Women and Animals -- you've got to see it to believe it...\" \nWelles moves on to the next MAGAZINE, turning to the back, again, page after page: \"Watersports and Fisting Specialists,\" \"100's of Anal Films,\" \"Asian Sex...\" \nHUNDREDS of 900 NUMBER ads with naked women urging callers to pick up the phone.

NONDESCRIPT ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS \nIn a dark room, we don't know where, a DARK FIGURE of a MAN is silhouetted.  He wears HEADPHONES, listening... \nWELLES' VOICE (V.O.)

Just drop it and come back... \nWELLES' VOICE (V.O.) (through headphone) I would if I could.  I'll be home soon, believe me.  It won't be long. \nAMY'S VOICE (V.O.)

Told you you would. \nWelles shows his IDENTIFICATION, lets Max get a good look. \nWELLES I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help. \nMAX (of identification) Thomas Welles.  Nice picture. \nWelles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter. \nWELLES I'll be outside having a cigarette. \nWelles leaves.  Max watches him go.  Max opens the envelope, takes out two fifty dollar bills, pockets them. \nMAX (to other clerk) Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break. \nEXT.  ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY \nWelles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around. \nMAX I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight. \nWELLES Good for you. \nWelles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with shopping carts overflowing with junk. \nWELLES How long you been working there? \nMAX Three, four years. \nWELLES What's your name, if you don't mind me asking? \nMAX Max. \nWELLES Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally... \n", "test1_true": "WELLES Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.

If I ask and you are, you have to tell me. \nWELLES I'm not a cop. \nMAX You're a private eye.  Like Shaft. \nWELLES Not quite. \nMAX From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here? \nWELLES Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money. \nMAX How much? \nWELLES How much do you make now? \nMAX Four hundred a week, off the books. \nWELLES Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days. \nMAX Sounds good, pops. \nWELLES Here's my number if you need it...

WELLES ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles sleeps, despite the stead SOUND of TRAFFIC racing by his window.  The PHONE RINGS, waking him.

DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT \nAgainst the backdrop of downtown LA's bright skyscrapers, Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city, smaller, older, darker buildings... \nEXT.  DOWNTOWN STREETS -- NIGHT \nThe only people on the street are HOMELESS and SHADY CHARACTERS.  Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted PARKING LOT.  There are a few cars parked in one corner. \nWelles parks near the other cars and gets out.  Max stands against a chain link fence.  Welles goes to meet him. \nMAX Come on. \nMax leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways. \nEXT.

OLD BUILDING -- NIGHT \nMax enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow, labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs.  Welles follows. \nThey come to another STAIRWAY leading down.  At the bottom, a thick-necked GOON stands guarding double doors. \nGOON Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement? \nMAX Fuck you, Larry. \nMax heads to the double doors, waits for Welles. \nGOON (to Welles) Are you a law enforcement... ? \nWELLES No. \nINT.  BASEMENT -- NIGHT \nMax and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market.  It's incredibly quiet.  About fifteen CARD TABLES are set up in rows.  The MEN behind the tables and the thirty or so \"CUSTOMERS\" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society. \nThese are MIDDLE-AGED MEN, most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid. \nONE DEALER We're shutting down in fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes. \nWelles makes his way to the tables, wary.  One table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with HUNDREDS of PHOTOS of young children, mostly boys, naked.  Each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape. \nWelles swallows back disgust. \nThe next table is piled high with used pornographic MAGAZINES.  There are baggies with COLORFUL PILLS laid out. X-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands. \nMax follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette. \nAnother table offers VIDEO TAPES with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, \"two,\" \"sixteen,\" \"five.\"  And many bootleg VIDEOS with grainy, homemade labels showing WOMEN in extreme BONDAGE. \nWelles watches out the corner of his eye as the PLUMP MAN beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures. Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking DEALER who's counting money. \nWELLES (points to numbered videos) What are these? \nANGRY DEALER Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free. \nWelles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip. \nWELLES Anything harder? \nANGRY DEALER There's nothing harder. \n", "test1_id": 300, "test2_input": "Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse... \nThere's his gun, lying there, far away. \nEddie runs for the gun. \nWelles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun, knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but... \nBullets hit the floor as the table falls. \nWelles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand, gets it open, holds it between his knees... \nWelles grabs a bullet... \nEddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air... \nMachine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with trembling hands... \nWelles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises, taking aim across the warehouse... \nWELLES Stop Eddie! \nEddie's running... \nWELLES (pulls back the hammer) I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in the back... ! \nEddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun... \nMachine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach. Welles points his gun at Machine. \nWELLES Come back, or I put a hole in him. \nEddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away. \nWELLES You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine.  And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you. \nEddie turns, starts walking back... \nWELLES (to Machine) Take off the mask. \nMachine shakes his head. \nWELLES Take it off! \nMACHINE You got one bullet. \nWelles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the DOOR behind him... \nMACHINE The only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you. \nWelles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows. \nWelles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie. \nWelles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES... breaks the handcuff chain. \nWelles bolts to the door... \nMACHINE Get the gun! \nEddie runs back towards his gun. Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door, but agony doubles him back over to his knees. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nWelles shoves out into daylight, fleeing down the stairs, running towards his car... \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles climbs in, gets out his keys, starts the car... He pulls away, TIRES SCREECHING.

WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to his ear.  The HIGHWAY rushes past out the car window. \nWELLES (into phone) Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... \nAMY (V.O.) (from phone) What's wrong?  Are you alright? \nWELLES (into phone) I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.

Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her? \nEDDIE It was a lot of fucking money. \nWelles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing... \nWELLES So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.

BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT \nWelles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT. \nIN THE CAR \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center with attached wings of rooms on both sides. \nThe LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken. \nIN THE LOT \nWelles turns out headlights and parks. He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD.

I never saw anyone get done before. \nWELLES You enjoy it? \nEDDIE Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money. \nWELLES Tell me what happened. \nEDDIE What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop... \nWELLES Nobody saw you bring her in? \nEDDIE There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work. \nWELLES What did you do with her body? \nEDDIE Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. \nWELLES Show me. \nEXT.

(nods to forest) ... out there somewhere. \nWELLES Where?  Show me where. \nEDDIE I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine. \nWelles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor. \nEDDIE You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.  You can't do anything. \nWelles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious. \nWELLES I can kill you.  I can leave you out here, just like you left her. \nEddie's not backing down. \nEDDIE Do it. \nWELLES Don't think I won't. \nEDDIE Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy? \nWELLES Easy enough for you. \nEDDIE I never killed anyone. \nWELLES That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you \"felt like it.\"  Almost makes you worse. \nEDDIE What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ? \nEddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away... \nEDDIE Where you going?  You're the one with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless enough?  Come on... \nEddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face. \nEDDIE Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name?  Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it.  Fucking do it! \nWelles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's forehead, pulls back the hammer... \nEddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes. \nWelles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger... \nINT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT \nEddie's thrown face down to the floor.

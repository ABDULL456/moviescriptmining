MIAMI AIRPORT, TERMINAL -- DAY \nAmongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen sits TOM WELLES, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and gray.  He's eating crackers from a cellophane package, sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an ARRIVAL GATE. \nAT THE GATE \nPASSENGERS arrive: the paunchy, graying men of First Class leading the pack, except for a handsome YOUNG REPUBLICAN poster boy hurrying along. \nACROSS THE TERMINAL \nWelles gets up and FOLLOWS... \nEXT.  MIAMI AIRPORT, CURBSIDE -- DAY \nWelles comes outside, squinting in the sun, moving down the sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder... \nThe Young Republican is lead to a waiting LIMO by a DRIVER. \nWelles moves to the nearby TAXI STAND... \nINT.  TAXI -- DAY \nWelles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind. \nCAB DRIVER Where to? \nWelles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass. \nWELLES Follow that limousine.  Don't get too close, don't let it get too far away.  Just keep with it. \nCAB DRIVER You kidding? \nWELLES Nope. \nThe cab set in motion.  Welles takes out cigarettes, lighting one, takes out a small NOTEPAD and makes notations. \nCAB DRIVER Uh, listen... you're not supposed to be smoking in here.  I'm sorry, that's company policy... \nWELLES How about this... every cigarette I smoke, I give you five dollars? \nCAB DRIVER Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good... \nEXT.  MIAMI BEACH, \"GOLD COAST\" -- DAY \nIn front of an Art Deco hotel, the driver opens the limousine door and the Young Republican steps out. \nACROSS THE STREET \nWelles watches from inside the double-parked taxicab. \nEXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY \nNot exactly four-star.  \"AD LT MOVIES EVERY ROOM.\" \nINT.

MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE, RESTAURANT -- DAY \nWelles sits alone at the bar, eating a sandwich, bored.  He watches some fuzzy ESPN on the t.v., looks at his watch. \nEXT.  MIAMI BEACH MOTOR LODGE -- DAY \nWelles walks across the parking lot, gets into his RENTAL CAR, starts it and drives away. \nEXT.  MIAMI BEACH DISCOTHEQUE -- NIGHT \nYoung Republican and a GAUDY WOMAN exit the disco, MUSIC THROBBING out from the doors behind them.  They join hands, drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. \nDOWN THE STREET \nWelles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a CAMERA with TELEPHOTO LENS: whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK, whir, CLICK... Welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn. \nINT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT \nThe familiar DRONE of flight.  Welles is shoehorned into his aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal. \nAn OLDER WOMAN arrives in the aisle.  Welles picks up his tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt, struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. \nOLDER WOMAN Thank you. \nWelles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  He returns to toiling over his miniature supper. \nEXT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT \nWelles' AIRPLANE ROARS down with a SCREECH, landing lights gleaming.  The airport is small, relatively isolated. \nTITLE:      Harrisburg, Pennsylvania \nINT.  HARRISBURG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT \nPassengers arrive.  Welles is with them, searching the few PEOPLE waiting in the terminal hallway.  Welles smiles... \nWelles' wife, AMY, smiles when she sees him.  She's plain and pretty, holding one hand on a BABY STROLLER beside her. Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her. \nAMY Welcome home. \nDown the lane, PINS SCATTER.  One pin remains standing. \nWelles balls up his fists and curses, walks back towards his rowdy, mocking teammates.  He shouts back at them, laughing, grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nDinner.  Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy in a high chair.  Amy feeds Cindy between bites.  Welles is still in his league shirt. \nAMY You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend? \nWELLES Sure.  I'll call the guy. \nAMY You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it? \nWELLES I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless. (eating) You have bridge here Saturday? \nAMY Betty's out of town so we're playing next week. \nWelles nods, eating.  He watches Amy feed Cindy.  The PHONE starts RINGING.  Welles goes to answer it. \nWELLES (into PHONE) Hello.  Yes... could you hold on a minute...? \nWelles hands the phone to Amy, pats Cindy's head as he heads downstairs, through the LIVING ROOM... \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT \nWelles enters his well kept OFFICE, turns on a light at the desk.  The room is filled with FILE CABINETS and shelves of BOOKS, hundreds of PHONE BOOKS and a COPY MACHINE.  Welles picks up the phone and cups the receiver. \nWELLES (shouts upstairs) Okay, I've got it. (into phone) Hello... sorry, I was switching phones.  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Christian. (listens) Yes.  Yes, I understand... tomorrow evening should be fine... \nWelles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes. \nEXT.  CHRISTIAN COMPOUND -- DUSK \nA huge OLD WORLD MANSION is situated at the center of acres of Pennsylvania forest and vast gardens.  Welles' car heads down a long tree lined drive, to the dark mansion. \nINT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nWelles follows a BUTLER down a long hall. \nINT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, LIBRARY -- NIGHT \nThe butler shows Welles in, shuts the door. Towering SHELVES of BOOKS are serviced by ladders.  Far across the room, an old, sad woman, MRS. CHRISTIAN, sits waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a LAWYER. \nMRS CHRISTIAN Mister Welles. You're very prompt. \nWELLES I try to be. \nWelles crosses towards them. It takes a while. \nMRS CHRISTIAN I appreciate your coming on such short notice. \nMrs. Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it. \nMRS CHRISTIAN This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney. \nWelles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over. \nWELLES Uh huh, pleasure. \nMRS CHRISTIAN Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. \nLONGDALE Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you. \nWELLES I'm listening. \nLONGDALE As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. \nWELLES Of what sort? \nLONGDALE You are a private investigator? \nWELLES That's right. \nLONGDALE Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval. \nMRS CHRISTIAN Yes, how theatrical.  So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone. \nLongdale's irritated, but has no choice.  He walks away. \nMRS CHRISTIAN Have a pleasant evening. (to Welles) Will you have tea, Mister Welles? \nWELLES Thank you. \nMrs. Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table.  Welles watches Longdale exit. \nWELLES He's odd. \nMRS CHRISTIAN He's a lawyer. (offers tea) Please, sit, here... \nWelles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat. \nMRS CHRISTIAN I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places. \nWELLES I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire. \nMRS CHRISTIAN You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality. \nWelles nods, sipping tea. \nMRS CHRISTIAN As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now. \nWELLES My condolences. \nMRS CHRISTIAN His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma. \nWELLES You... you need to go to the police. \nMRS CHRISTIAN I told you I can't, not yet. \nWELLES You don't have any other choice. \nMRS CHRISTIAN (stands, shakes her head) No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first... \nWELLES It won't work like that. \nMRS CHRISTIAN Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her. \nWelles sits, rests his head in his hands. \nWELLES I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations... \nMRS CHRISTIAN You've found missing persons before. \nWELLES Nothing remotely like this. \nMRS CHRISTIAN I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. (pause) I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. (pause) You saw what he did to her. \nWelles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the dining room where the projector sits idle. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BABY'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nCindy is sound asleep in her crib. Welles is seated near, staring at his sleeping child. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles digs in piles of SHOEBOXES and BOOKS on the floor of his cluttered closet, finds what he wants: a LOCK BOX. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nWelles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box to reveal his GUN, HOLSTER and CLEANING SUPPLIES.  Welles takes out the gun, cleaning it.  Amy watches. \nWELLES This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money. \nAMY I understand. \nWELLES Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way. \nAMY I know. \nWELLES It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation. \nAMY Why the gun? \nWELLES I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution. (cleaning gun) Don't worry about me. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT \nWelles looks through one file cabinet.  He pulls out a FILE. It contains all sorts of POLICE ARTIST SKETCHES.  Welles finds one of a TEENAGE GIRL with dark hair, looks at it. \nWelles positions the sketch on his COPY MACHINE, hits copy. \nEXT.  WELLES' HOUSE, DRIVEWAY -- MORNING \nWelles loads BOXES and a SUITCASE into his car's back seat. \nWelles puts the lock box in the car's trunk, in a hiding place beside the spare tire.  He places a brown BRIEFCASE on top, covers them both with carpet.  He closes the trunk. \nEXT.  PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE -- MORNING \nLittle traffic.  Welles' Ford races down the highway. \nEXT.  CLEVELAND CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY \nCity skyline, overcast.  Looks like rain. \nTITLE:       Cleveland, Ohio \nEXT.  CLEVELAND STREETS -- DAY \nWelles' car moves slowly in a not-so-great neighborhood. Welles leans forward, peering through the windshield... \nAn APARTMENT BUILDING'S crooked SIGN lists \"WEEKLY RATES.\" \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM, CLEVELAND -- DAY \nDingy room.  Welles locks the door, puts the chain on. His suitcase and boxes are on the bed.  He begins unpacking, taking a PHOTO ENLARGER from one box and an 8MM PROJECTOR. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY \nThe developer's on the toilet.  DEVELOPING PANS are on the floor, developer bath, stop bath and fixing bath, with BOTTLES of CHEMICALS and packages of PHOTO PAPER.  Welles uses tape and ALUMINUM FOIL to black-out a window. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY \nPizza box on the bedside table.  Welles' suits hang in the closet.  Welles sits facing a small REEL TO REEL on a desk. He wears white gloves, handles the 8MM FILM, careful to hold it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting. \nWelles puts in a magnifying EYEPIECE, leaning close... \nWELLES' P.O.V. THROUGH MAGNIFYING LENS: studying the first few inches of exposed film, coming upon TINY LETTERS printed just below the sprocket holes: \"SUPRAlux 544.\" \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM, BATHROOM -- DAY \nRED BULB in the light socket.  Welles threads the 8MM FILM into his enlarger, still in white gloves. \nHe flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways IMAGE down onto the enlarger's baseboard, FOCUSING... it's the girl sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film. \nWelles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing tighter on the girl's face, REFOCUSING. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles comes out of the makeshift darkroom, holding a PHOTO of the girl.  He props the photo up on a dresser, stands looking at it.  Sad girl, staring forward. \nWELLES You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her. \nMrs. Mathews smiles. \nWELLES It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you. \nWelles smiles.  Mrs. Mathews takes out a cigarette.  Welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard. \nWELLES So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left? \nMRS MATHEWS No. \nWELLES She just seemed... depressed... ? \nMRS MATHEWS She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes. \nWELLES What was she running from? \nMRS MATHEWS I don't know. \nWELLES If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide? \nMRS MATHEWS Yes. \nWELLES September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared. \nMRS MATHEWS We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... \nWELLES Why do you think he did it? \nMRS MATHEWS It got to be too much for him. \nWELLES You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... (pause) Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse? \nMRS MATHEWS There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... \nWELLES I didn't mean to... \nMRS MATHEWS You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. \nWELLES I had to ask.  I apologize. \nMRS MATHEWS No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts. \nWelles is miserable.  A few CUSTOMERS walk past, looking at Mrs. Mathews.  She tries not to notice then noticing. \nMRS MATHEWS People remember me from the news. (pause) Can you drive me back now? \nWELLES Of course. \nINT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, MARY'S ROOM -- DAY \nMrs. Mathews enters.  Welles follows. \nThis was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- POSTERS of ACTORS on the wall, many STUFFED ANIMALS on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed.  Perfectly preserved. \nMRS MATHEWS This is her room. \nWelles looks around, uncomfortable. Shelves have PICTURES of MARY with female friends, a collection of CERAMIC FIGURINES of CLOWNS and ANIMALS. \nMRS MATHEWS The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it. \nWelles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a DESK where there are SIX brightly wrapped GIFTS. \nMRS MATHEWS \nThose are for her birthday.  One for every year she's missed.  They'll be waiting for her when she comes back. \nWelles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it.  He backs to the door, looks at his watch... \nWELLES I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow... \nMRS MATHEWS Okay. \nEXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- DAY \nWelles escapes to his car, climbing in.  He starts it up... \nIN THE CAR \nWelles drives, tears welling up in his eyes.  He has to pull over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles has unpacked.  He's on the bed, on his CELLULAR... \nWELLES (into phone) You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey. (listens) Call him back and tell him I said so.  The goddamn thing's still under warranty. (listens) I'm okay.  It's hard here.  It's hard. (listens) I've got a lead I have to follow through.  To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you.  I love you. \nINT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING \nWelles sits at the kitchen table.  Mrs. Mathews makes coffee.  The home's decor is cheap and flowery. \nMRS MATHEWS We weren't religious.  We never forced religion down her throat, like I've seen some parents do to their kids.  We never made her go to church.  But, after Mary was gone, that's when I got religious. \nMrs. Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits. \nMRS MATHEWS Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church. \nWELLES We're all like that. \nMRS MATHEWS Are you religious? \nWELLES No. \nMRS MATHEWS You should be. \nINT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nMrs. Mathews still gazes into the TV.  Welles passes the doorway, not looking in, heading to the front door, opening the door and walking out... \nMrs. Mathews doesn't even notice, doesn't look up. \nEXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE -- NIGHT \nWelles crosses the front lawn, not looking back, heading to the street, getting into his car, starting his car, doing a U-turn, driving away down the street. \nEXT.  FAYETTEVILLE AIRPORT, LONG TERM PARKING -- MORNING \nWelles' boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of his car.  Welles covers them with a blanket, shuts the door. \nWelles opens the trunk of his car, pulls back the carpeting. He opens the brown BRIEFCASE.  The briefcase is full of CASH, about $10,000, twenties and fifties in bundles. \nWelles transfers half the money into a carry-on bag, shuts the briefcase, covers it, closes the trunk. \nINT.  AIRPLANE, COACH -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE \nThe cabin's half-full, dark.  Passengers sleep.  Under the only illuminated reading light, Welles reads the PHOTOCOPIED DIARY.  MARY'S VOICE is a again a flat monotone... \nMARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) \"Dear diary.  I have a big math test tomorrow.  I have to get better grades.  How come everybody does better than me?  Kathy doesn't even study and she gets B's.  Two boys got in a fight after school today. One boy knocked the other boy's tooth out, at least that's what it looked like.  His nose and mouth were bleeding all over the place...\" \nEXT.

It's the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties and all his friends come around and party with him, but later when he dies nobody comes to his funeral.  Someone said there's a movie about it, but I looked in the video store and it wasn't there.\" \nWelles flips pages, further back in the DIARY... \nMARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) \"Dear diary.

BANK, PRIVACY BOOTH -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles is alone, opens the empty safe deposit drawer, takes the 8MM FILM from his pocket and puts it in the drawer. \nMARY'S VOICE (V.O., cont) \"... They eat lunch at the snack counter.  Hot dogs and soft pretzels.  Nachos with that orange cheese that comes out of a pump.

A few have their shirts off, crewcut and muscular. \nMAX It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one. \nWELLES I'll risk it. \nMax shoves everything into a bag and hands it over. \nMAX Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.  Have a nice day. \nWelles takes the bag.  Max returns to his book.  Welles is leaving, but stops at the end of the counter. \nWELLES What are you reading? \nMax holds up the book, \"ANAL SECRETARY.\" \nMAX Once you pick it up you can't put it down. \nWELLES Catchy title.  What are you really reading? (off Max's look) Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting. \nMax takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of the book and shows it to Welles.  \"Music for Chameleons.\" \nWELLES Truman Capote. \nMAX I tear off the cover and paste this one on... (nods towards clerk) You know how it is. \nWELLES Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts. \nMAX (smiles, shrugs) Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be? \nAnother CUSTOMER clears his throat, waiting at the register. Max turns to help him.  Welles heads out. \nINT.

Nice picture. \nWelles takes out an ENVELOPE, puts it on the counter. \nWELLES I'll be outside having a cigarette. \nWelles leaves.  Max watches him go.

ADULT BOOKSTORE -- DAY \nWelles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  Max comes out from the porn shop, walks to Welles, looking around. \nMAX I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight. \nWELLES Good for you. \nWelles and Max walk down the block, past HOMELESS MEN with shopping carts overflowing with junk. \nWELLES How long you been working there? \nMAX Three, four years. \nWELLES What's your name, if you don't mind me asking? \nMAX Max. \nWELLES Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally... \nWELLES Snuff? \nANGRY DEALER What you see is what I got, mister. \nWELLES You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend. \nANGRY DEALER There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off? \nThe dealer sits and keeps counting cash. Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a CURTAINED DOORWAY.  Welles walks to it, enters... \nINSIDE THE CURTAIN \nFolding chairs face a SCREEN.  A PROJECTOR shows a silent movie; a BUXOM WOMAN in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube.  A hairy, overweight MAN lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back. \nIn the darkness, a MAN shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating.  A few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of SOMEONE in a BLONDE WIG. \nA LARGE MAN approaches Welles from the dark. \nLARGE MAN You have to pay to come in here. \nWelles backs away, shuts the curtain. \nINT.  ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT \nNot many people in the place.  Welles drinks coffee.  Max eats a huge breakfast. \nMAX You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. \nWELLES Interesting theory. \nMAX What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product. \nWELLES Child pornography. \nMAX There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one. \nWELLES Snuff films. \nMAX I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing. \nWELLES What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see? \nMAX First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. \nWelles watches Max eat. \nWELLES How old are you? \nMAX Twenty-five. \nWELLES Where are your parents? \nMAX I don't know, where are yours? \nWELLES I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this? \nMAX I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about? \nWELLES You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else. \nMAX Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. \nWELLES You're telling me it doesn't get to you? \nMAX You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops? \nWELLES What about me? \nMAX I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids? \nWELLES A daughter. \nMAX So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this? \nWELLES Good question. \nEXT.  ALL NIGHT COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT \nMax and Welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking. \nACROSS THE STREET \nINSIDE A PARKED CAR, through the windshield, SOMEONE watches Max and Welles say goodnight.  Max walks to a waiting taxi. \nIt's the sinister lawyer watching, LONGDALE, the late Mr. Christian's attorney, watching Welles go to his rental car. \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE \nWelles is seated, PROJECTOR RUNNING, watching the 8MM film. \nThe last of the film makes its way through, threading out. The take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping... \nWelles stares at the blank white square of light projected onto the wall.  CELLULAR PHONE is HEARD RINGING... \nWelles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  The PHONE'S RINGING.  Welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at the cellular phone on the bedside table.  RINGING... \nWelles lets it RING.  RINGING... RINGING... till it finally stops.  Welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes. \nINT.  CHRISTIAN HOUSE, MR CHRISTIAN'S OFFICE -- DAY \nMrs. Christian is behind the desk, surrounded by BOXES of BANK RECORDS and FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, on the PHONE. \nMRS CHRISTIAN (into phone) My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits.  Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself... \nINT.  PHONE BOOTH, HOLLYWOOD -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS \nMARY'S VOICE (V.O.) (as Welles reads) \"Star light, star bright, First star I've seen tonight, Wish I may, wish I might, Have this wish I wish tonight.\" \nWelles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of Mary's DIARY.  He turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts the DIARY PAGE against it.  Perfect match. \nWelles stands looking at the poem.  He turns the page over, finds written, in cursive: \nModels Wanted 213-555-6643 \nEXT.  PHONE BOOTH -- DAY \nWelles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page, phone to his ear.  It RINGS, RINGS, RINGS... \nMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) (from phone) Celebrity Films. \nWelles hangs up, begins searching the booth's YELLOW PAGES. \nEXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY \nA poverty stricken business section of Wilshire.  Welles gets out of his parked car, looks up at a decaying Art Deco building that's painted blue top-to-bottom. \nWelles crosses through traffic. \nINT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, LOBBY -- DAY \nWelles studies the REGISTRY, finds \"Celebrity Films.\" \nINT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- DAY \nPaint's peeling.  Walls are water stained.  Welles climbs stairs, winded, sweating, up the stairwell... \nINT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY \nWelles comes out a stairwell DOOR, catching his breath.  A couple of SECRETARIES wait for the elevator.  Welles moves down the hall, around a corner. \nEach office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass. There's a \"Dental Office,\" \"Wilson Travel Cruises,\" and at the end of the hall, \"Celebrity Films Inc., Eddie Poole, Professional Casting and Distribution, Suite 804.\" \nWelles heads back the way he came. \nEXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY \nWelles crosses back to the other side of the street, goes to stand near his car.  He looks up at the blue office building, counting up floors, counting windows across. \nSatisfied, he turns, backing up, looking up at the tall OFFICE BUILDING across from the blue building.  There's a sign on this adjacent building, \"OFFICE SPACE AVAILABLE.\" \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE, 9TH FLOOR -- DAY \nEmpty office.  Welles is let in by a disinterested LANDLORD. Welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and opens the blinds. \nThese windows afford an excellent view of the blue building across the street, at about 8th floor level. \nWELLES This is better. (turns to landlord) This will be fine. \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT \nWelles has transferred most of his belongings here, SUITCASE open on the floor, CARD TABLE set up with fast food on it, an ARMY COT against one wall.  Welles sits in a chair at the window, looks through BINOCULARS on a TRIPOD. \nWELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: searching up the dark floors of the blue building, as Welles counts under his breath.  Moving over... stopping on one window, FOCUSING... \nWelles locks the tripod.  He goes to sit on the army cot, picks up his CELLULAR.  He looks at the phone, deciding. He puts down the phone.  He turns off the LAMP on the floor, lays back in the cot, going to sleep. \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY \nWELLES' P.O.V., THROUGH BINOCULARS: watching the window of Celebrity Films Inc.  We can see most of the office from here.  It's crowded with junk, BOXES, piles of VIDEO TAPES. There's a disorganized DESK by the window. \nWelles sits looking through the binoculars. \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: a pudgy man, EDDIE POOLE, in a loud, print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail. He smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, Lots of rings.  He drinks coffee, answers the phone.  He talks into the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down. \nWelles rises.  He looks to the wall where THREE PHOTOGRAPHS culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of Mary, the picture of Masked Man's tattooed hand, and... \n... the grainy image of the Third Man in the mirror. Welles comes to study this third photo. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie packs VIDEO TAPES into a box, covering them with Styrofoam peanuts, sealing the box. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- DAY \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie finishes a call and hangs up.  He sits back in his chair.  He starts looking in his desk drawers, finds a MAGAZINE and opens it on the desk.  It's porn.  Eddie turns pages, looking at naked women.  He sits back in his chair, begins unbuckling his belt. \nWelles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust. \nWELLES No thank you. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT.  ADJACENT OFFICE -- NIGHT \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's on the phone, pouring himself a drink from the liquor bottle on his desk, finishing the call, hanging up.  He shakes his head in disgust, drinks the drink, walks out of view.  After a moment, the lights go out. \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD HILLS -- NIGHT \nAn old, dented CAR makes its way up the tight, twisting roads of the Hollywood Hills.  Eddie's at the wheel.  Not far behind, Welles' rental car follows... \nFURTHER ON \nEddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a ramshackle HOUSE, parks.  Welles' car passes by... \nFURTHER, AROUND A CURVE \nWelles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around, moving back down the hill, slowly... \nWELLES (V.O.) I know what you did. \nEDDIE (V.O.) What? \nWELLES (V.O.) I know what you did. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Who is this. \nWELLES (V.O.) You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago... \nEDDIE (V.O.) What the fuck are you.. ? \nWELLES (V.O.) You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good. \nWelles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars. \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  He stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  Finally, he runs his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back down.  He gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink. \nWelles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on. \nWELLES Come on, Eddie... \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie sits motionless. \nWELLES (O.S.) ... come on... \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: Eddie picks up the phone, DIALS a NUMBER.  We hear the PHONE RING in the HEADPHONES \nMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) (through headphones) ... Hello? \nEDDIE (V.O.) (through headphones) Dino, it's Eddie... Eddie Poole... \nDINO (V.O.) What do you want? \nEDDIE (V.O.) I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. \nDINO (V.O.) What are you talking about? \nEDDIE (V.O.) The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop... \nDINO (V.O.) Bullshit. \nEDDIE (V.O.) I'm telling you... \nDINO (V.O.) Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ? \nEDDIE (V.O.) Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out! \nDINO (V.O.) There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader. \nEDDIE (V.O.) Dino... \nDINO (V.O) Nobody knows anything. \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: as DINO is HEARD HANGING UP, Eddie reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office. \nWelles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's found them.  He looks to the PHOTO of the Third Man. \nWELLES That is you, isn't it, Eddie? \nWelles goes to the RECORDER, turns on the TONE DECODER.  Its LED window LIGHTS UP.  Welles hits STOP, REWIND, PLAY... \nWELLES VOICE (V.O.) (from recorder) ... and your pals, you're fucked... \nHits FAST FORWARD... hits PLAY, watching the TONE DECODER. From the RECORDER, the SOUND of EDDIE DIALING a NUMBER on his touch tone phone... and as EACH TONE is HEARD, a corresponding NUMBER appears on the DECODER'S LED readout: \nThe recorder continues, REPLAYING the CONVERSATION between Eddie and Dino, while Welles studies the green LED digits. \nWELLES (quiet, to himself) Two one two. \nEXT.  MANHATTAN CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT \nThe brilliant lights of New York's peerless skyscrapers. \nEXT.  59TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT \nFOLLOW Welles' Ford as it moves along with traffic, crossing the 59th Street Bridge, into the heart of Manhattan. \nEXT.  BANK -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY \n\"Chase Manhattan Bank,\" mid-town. \nINT.  CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, SAFE DEPOSIT BOOTH -- DAY \nWelles puts the 8MM FILM into SAFE DEPOSIT DRAWER, shuts it. \nINT.  NY PUBLIC LIBRARY, REFERENCE -- DAY \nBusy and crowded, but quiet.  Welles places a massive tome down on a table:  \"Haines Criss-Cross Directory.\" \nWelles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone number written: \"(212) 555-9906.\"  He opens the reference book, searching pages... \nThousands of TELEPHONE NUMBERS are LISTED in SEQUENCE, each with an address.  Welles runs his finger down the page. \nEXT.  SOHO STREETS -- DAY \nPEDESTRIANS everywhere.  Streets are clogged with DELIVERY TRUCKS loading and unloading.  Cars horns blow.  Welles walks to an old, WAREHOUSE BUILDING shoulder to shoulder with other buildings, labeled \"1204\" in burnished steel. \nWelles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers. \nThe top button's labeled \"Greystone Imports,\" the bottom button reads \"Lang Interior Design, by appt.\"  The middle button is labeled only by a drawing of a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER. \nWelles looks up at the building. \nEXT.  1204 WAREHOUSE, SOHO -- LATER DAY \nMRS. CHRISTIAN is HEARD COUGHING.  Welles waits. \nWELLES I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve. \nMRS CHRISTIAN How will I get it to you? \nWELLES If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it. \nEXT.  MOTEL, HELL'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nA TAXI pulls over in front of this flea-bag motel.  Max gets out with a SUITCASE, looks at the dubious accommodations. \nINT.  MOTEL, MAX'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nMax enters with Welles, turns on a light and throws his suitcase on the bed.  The room is disgusting. \nMAX You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. \nWELLES It's their Presidential Suite. \nMAX Great. \nMax looks in the bathroom. \nMAX Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag? \nWELLES It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me? \nMax opens his suitcase, takes out THREE VIDEO TAPES. \nHe hands them to Welles.  The boxes are covered in jumbled PHOTO COLLAGES: American flag, S+M men and women, a skull, mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs. \nMAX Dino Velvet. \nINT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles is lit by the flicker from the TELEVISION SCREEN.  WE SEE NOTHING.  We HEAR the rhythmic MUFFLED MOANS of a WOMAN from the TV, can't tell if it's pleasure or pain. \nMax is asleep in the bed, PIZZA BOX near his feet. \nWelles drinks beer, gets up and ejects the CASSETTE from a VCR, tosses it aside, tired.  He picks another Dino Velvet TAPE, puts it in, sits. \nON TV: GOTHIC ROCK is HEARD over old, scratchy IMAGES: of Klansmen around a burning cross... Dracula menacing a sleeping woman... a man in a Devil costume dancing... \nWelles opens another beer. \nON TV: a WOMAN is tied up, arms in the air, hanging from the ceiling, gagged and blindfolded, in a dungeon lit by candelabras.  Then, glimpsed IMAGES: worms writhing in slime... gargoyles... a guillotine falling.  Then, the bound woman, struggling.  A MASKED MAN in a leather jacket enters. He wears a LEATHER MASK with zipper eyes and mouth... \nThis focuses Welles' attention. \nON TV: the Masked Man circles the captured woman... \nWELLES Max... wake up... \nMax awakens, rolling over, groggy. \nMAX Wha... ? \nWELLES (points at TV) Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he? \nMax tries to see, eyes barely open. \nMAX He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these. \nWelles watches.  On the TV, Masked Man takes off his jacket shirtless, reveals an impossibly muscled body.  Huge arms, thick chest, oiled, dotted in pimples. \nMAX Why?  He have something to do with whatever you're into? \nStill watching the behemoth on TV, Welles is less sure. \nON TV: the bulging Masked Man flexes, ripped. \nWELLES No... it's nothing... that's not him. \nWelles rubs his eyes, sits back.  Max sits up, watching. \nON TV: Masked Man pulls the bound woman's head back by her hair, licks her face with his thick tongue... \nCLOSE ON: Masked Man grips the woman's head, still licking. He pulls down the woman's blindfold... \nWelles sits forward, realizing, horrified... \nWelles goes to the VCR, hits PAUSE.  The IMAGE on TV FREEZES.  Welles goes back, FRAME by FRAME... \n... to the CLOSE UP where Masked Man grips the woman's face. FREEZE FRAME.  On Masked Man's hand: a TATTOO, on the arch between his forefinger and thumb, same as the scrawny Masked Man in the snuff film.  A PENTAGRAM TATTOO. \nWELLES Who is he? \nMAX I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... \nWELLES Who is he, his name? \nMAX Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself \"Machine,\" that's what they call him.  Machine. \nWelles hits PLAY.  On TV, Masked Man runs his hands up and down the woman's body.  The woman's eyes are filled with fear.  Welles sits, unnerved, watching. \nMAX They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using. \nMax rolls over, trying to get back to sleep. \nMAX He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He loves what he does for a living. \nINT.  WELLES' MOTEL ROOM -- DAY \nWelles enters, carries an OVERNIGHT PACKAGE and his LOCK BOX.  At the desk, he tears open the package, opens the MANILA ENVELOPE inside; finds FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in thousand dollar bills, wrapped in plastic and masking tape. \nWELLES And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask. \nDINO VELVET Machine. \nWELLES If it's not him, there's no deal. \nDino drums his painted fingernails on his lips. \nDINO VELVET He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand. \nWELLES We can do that. \nDINO VELVET Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? (off Welles' nod) Very good. \nDino stands, picks up a still CAMERA off his desk and comes to look at Welles, studying him. \nDINO VELVET You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind? \nWELLES I'd rather you didn't. \nDINO VELVET What's the problem? \nWELLES I'm camera shy. \nDINO VELVET You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture? \nWELLES Those are two different kinds of trust. (stands) Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business. \nWelles leaves.  Max goes with him.  Dino watches them leave. \nEXT.  MANHATTAN STREET -- NIGHT \nHORNS BLARE.  TWO CARS have collided head-on.  A large CROWD gathers.  One windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  The driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood. \nOn a nearby street corner, Welles in on a PAY PHONE. HEAVY METAL can be HEARD filtered through the receiver. \nWELLES (into phone) So, what do you say? \nINT.  DINO VELVET'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS \nDino's stands in the middle of his office, naked, his back to us, 8MM camera in hand, on the phone.  A NAKED WOMAN dances for Dino.  A Heavy Metal MUSIC VIDEO plays on a TV. \nDINO VELVET (into phone) I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars. \nWELLES (V.O.) (from phone) Machine's in? \nDINO VELVET (into phone) He's in.  It will be his pleasure. \nINT.  PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS \nDINO VELVET (V.O.) (from phone) Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three o'clock, tomorrow. \nWelles digs out his notepad, writing. \nWELLES (into phone) Where's that? \nDINO VELVET (V.O.) Brooklyn.  Don't be late. \nEXT.  MOTEL COURTYARD, POOL -- NIGHT \nHORNS and TRAFFIC are HEARD.  Max and Welles sit in lawn chairs at the tiny pool.  Welles smokes.  Max drinks beer. They watch an ELDERLY WOMAN in a one piece bathing suit climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in. \nMAX What's next? \nWELLES I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask. \nMAX Still don't want to tell me what you're doing? \nWELLES Nope. \nThe old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board. Welles takes out a thick ENVELOPE, hands it to Max. \nWELLES This is for you. \nMax doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope. \nMAX What's this? \nWELLES It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services. \nMax looks at it again, can't believe it. \nMAX Look... that's awful generous and everything... \nWELLES It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? (pause) Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever. \nWelles puts his cigarette out, stands. \nWELLES I'll see you around. \nWelles walks away, heading to his room.  Max watches him go, doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope. \nThe old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- DAY \nA deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied buildings.  A few burnt out cars on the street.  Welles drives through, watchful. \nWelles drives past a huge TWO-STORY WAREHOUSE, does a u-turn. He parks the car. \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY \nWelles checks his gun, returns it to his holster. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nWelles looks across to the car... The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way... \nEDDIE This is the fucker?  Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything... \nEddie walks around the bed, studies Welles.  Welles watches him.  Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward... \nPUNCHES Welles in the side of the head. Welles goes down, clutching his face. \nEDDIE Doesn't look like shit. \nEddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed, frisking him from head to toe. \nLongdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles.  Welles looks up, holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed. \nDINO VELVET (to Welles) You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? \nWELLES I remember him. \nLONGDALE Let's get this over with. \nDINO VELVET Fine idea. \nDino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles. \nDINO VELVET You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand.  And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive... \nDino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE. \nAcross the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out... \nIt's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly conscious.  Machine throws him to the floor. \nWELLES No... \nWelles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy. \nDINO VELVET Friend of yours? \nWELLES Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go... \nDINO VELVET Can you guess what I'm going to say next? \nWELLES He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this... \nDINO VELVET Bring the film, or we kill him. \nSorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice. \nWELLES I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city... \nDINO VELVET How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company. \nDino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale. Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him. \nDINO VELVET Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max. \nEDDIE Move it, dirtbag... ! \nEddie comes to SHOVE Welles.  Welles stumbles to the ground, gets to his feet.  Welles walks, takes one last glance back towards Max.  Longdale follows. \nDINO VELVET (watching them go) Do hurry. \nEXT.  MANHATTAN STREETS -- DAY \nWelles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town. \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS \nWelles is at the wheel.  Longdale is in the passenger seat, gun held in his lap. \nWELLES You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself. \nLONGDALE Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. \nWELLES So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege. \nLONGDALE That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly. \nWELLES Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money. \nLONGDALE I was well compensated. \nWELLES That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me? \nLONGDALE Never mind how I found you. \nWELLES Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies... \nLONGDALE They're no friends of mine. \nWELLES Except, you're willing commit murder with them. \nLONGDALE None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers. \nWELLES Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her. \nWelles looks at Longdale. \nWELLES You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... \nLONGDALE Shut up. \nWELLES Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. \nLONGDALE Shut your mouth and drive! \nEddie turns, looks across the warehouse... \nThere's his gun, lying there, far away. \nEddie runs for the gun. \nWelles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun, knocks the table over.  He's got the gun, but... \nBullets hit the floor as the table falls. \nWelles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand, gets it open, holds it between his knees... \nWelles grabs a bullet... \nEddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air... \nMachine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with trembling hands... \nWelles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises, taking aim across the warehouse... \nWELLES Stop Eddie! \nEddie's running... \nWELLES (pulls back the hammer) I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in the back... ! \nEddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun... \nMachine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach. Welles points his gun at Machine. \nWELLES Come back, or I put a hole in him. \nEddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away. \nWELLES You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine.  And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you. \nEddie turns, starts walking back... \nWELLES (to Machine) Take off the mask. \nMachine shakes his head. \nWELLES Take it off! \nMACHINE You got one bullet. \nWelles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the DOOR behind him... \nMACHINE The only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you. \nWelles backs away, drags the bedframe.  Eddie's getting close.  Welles points the gun at Eddie.  Eddie slows. \nWelles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie. \nWelles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, FIRES... breaks the handcuff chain. \nWelles bolts to the door... \nMACHINE Get the gun! \nEddie runs back towards his gun. Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door, but agony doubles him back over to his knees. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE -- DAY \nWelles shoves out into daylight, fleeing down the stairs, running towards his car... \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles climbs in, gets out his keys, starts the car... He pulls away, TIRES SCREECHING.  Behind, Eddie gives chase, running, FIRING his gun... \nWelles ducks as BULLETS SLAM the car, SHATTERING WINDOWS. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles' car picks up speed, takes a turn, BURNING RUBBER... Behind, Eddie curses, runs back to the warehouse. \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles glances back, ENGINE ROARING.  He tries to keep from crying, steers with one hand, holds his bleeding face. \nEXT. BROOKLYN STREETS -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles' car races away. \nINT.  WELLES' HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nAmy looks tired, like she hasn't slept.  She feeds Cindy. PHONE RINGS.  Amy goes to answer it... \nAMY (into phone) Hello? \nWELLES (V.O.) (from phone) Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully.. \nAMY (into phone) Tom?  Where have you been... ? \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY \nWelles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to his ear.  The HIGHWAY rushes past out the car window. \nWELLES (into phone) Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... \nAMY (V.O.) (from phone) What's wrong?  Are you alright? \nWELLES (into phone) I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there \nAMY (V.O.) ... What's going on? \nAMY Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through... \nWELLES I don't know what to say \nAMY You're killing me... \nWELLES Don't... \nAMY What was I supposed to think happened to you?! \nWELLES Amy... \nWelles goes to Amy, but she pulls away.  She sits on the bed.  Cindy's still crying.  Welles sits beside Amy, puts her arms around her. \nWELLES Forgive me. \nAmy cradles Cindy.  Welles rests his head on Amy's shoulder, places one hand on Cindy. \nWELLES We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can.  I'm sorry. (pause) We're going to be okay. \nWelles rises.  He goes to the PHONE, starts dialing.  Amy looks at him, wipes tears. \nAMY Who are you calling? \nWELLES Mrs. Christian. \nAMY What? \nWELLES She's all I've got.  She's the only witness. \nAMY Tom... she's dead. \nWelles looks to Amy. \nAMY She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper... \nWELLES I just talked to her. \nCindy's crying.  Welles sits into a chair, trying to understand this, his mind racing.  He hangs up the phone. \nAMY How could you not know? \nMisery pulls down the corners of Welles' mouth.  He tries to find words, but none come.  He sits forward and hides his face in his hands, overwhelmed.  Cindy's crying. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT \nCindy sleeps, encircled by pillows and blankets on the bed. Amy watches her, runs her hand gently across Cindy's head. \nAmy rises, turns out the light, goes to a BALCONY DOOR... \nEXT.  HOTEL ROOM, BALCONY -- NIGHT \nWelles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking into the parking lot.  Amy joins him, sits. \nAMY Promise you'll stay. \nWelles looks at Amy. \nWELLES Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were.  Whatever it was, forget it. \nWelles takes a deep breath, nods his head. \nAMY Promise me. \nWelles looks out into the night sky of stars. \nWELLES I promise. \nAmy comes to kiss Welles.  Welles wraps his arms around her and holds her tight.  She holds him. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM -- LATER NIGHT \nAmy is asleep on the bed beside Cindy.  Welles comes out from the bathroom in a fresh shirt and suit, turns off the bathroom light.  He stands looking at Cindy and Amy. \nEXT.  HOTEL -- NIGHT \nWelles exits the hotel, heading to his Ford. \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT \nWelles drives, staring ahead.  Through the windshield, the headlights illuminate the endless roadway. \nEXT.  KENNEDY AIRPORT -- NIGHT \nAirplanes take flight.  Manhattan glitters in the distance. \nEXT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY \nEddie Poole's building.  A typically bright, sunny LA day. In the street, Welles parks a rental car, gets out. \nINT.  WILSHIRE OFFICE BUILDING, 8TH FLOOR HALL -- DAY \nELEVATOR doors open and Welles gets off.  He moves down the hall, around a corner, heading to \"Celebrity Films.\" \nWelles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  He looks around, takes two steps back, KICKS forward... SMASHES the translucent glass of the door... \nINT.  CELEBRITY FILMS OFFICE -- DAY \nWelles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to open the door.  The office has been cleaned out, trash on the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves empty, posters gone... \nWelles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it. \nINT.  8TH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY \nPeople peer out from other offices, worried.  Welles exits Eddie's office, ignoring them, goes around the corner, straight to the STAIRWELL, heading downstairs... \nWelles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape, till Eddie's securely bound. \nHe rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out... \nEDDIE Fucking pussy! \nEXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT \nWelles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his wit's end.  He opens the glove compartment, finds cigarettes, digs one out and lights it. \nHe looks back to the motel room. \nHe looks down to the glove compartment, at his CELLULAR PHONE.  After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at it in his hand. \nIN THE LOT \nWelles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back, staring at the sky.  He closes his eyes, smokes. \nWelles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers. He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad, pages through, studies one page. \nWelles sits up.  He gathers himself, throws his cigarette, dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) (from phone) Hello... ? \nWELLES (into phone) Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) (from phone) I remember.  You just left... \nWELLES (into phone) I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne... (struggling) When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true... \nWelles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) What are you talking about... ? \nWELLES She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) What... ? \nTears comes to Welles' eyes.  It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do in his entire life. \nWELLES Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead. \nMRS MATHEWS Who is this... ? \nWELLES Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) Who are you? \nWELLES They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her... \nMRS MATHEWS No... \nWELLES He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) No... no... no... \nWELLES They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... \nMRS MATHEWS (V.O.) Why... why are you doing this to me... ? \nWELLES They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time... \nMRS MATHEWS is HEARD SCREAMING, letting out a CHOCKING SOB. Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping... \nWELLES I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do... \nWelles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the ground, utterly drained.  He puts his forearm over his eyes, gasping, sucking air... \nHe looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing it to fuel his rage... \nHe takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the gun and pours the bullets out.  He closes the gun and walks towards the motel room... \nINT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS \nWelles SHOVES the door aside.  The door's hinge breaks and the door falls... \nEddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look... \nThe door SLAMS to the floor. \nWelles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his arm with the gun grasped by the butt... \nEddie's eyes go wide with fear... \nWelles SWINGS the gun down at Eddie's head... \nEXT.  MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS \nThe only SOUNDS come from the NIGHT FOREST.  CRICKETS and distant BIRDS.  We can't see anything but the TOTAL DARKNESS through the open door of the room.  A CAR is HEARD, getting LOUDER as it passes, FAINTER as it gets further away. \nFinally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered red.  His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood. \nWelles looks back into the room, backing away.  He turns and goes to his car... \nIN THE CAR \nWelles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt, revolted.  He starts the car. \nINT.  EDDIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nWelles enters and crosses through... \nEXT.  QUEENS STREET -- DAY \nA relatively quiet residential street.  HOMES are small, two story affairs, close together, each very much like its neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls. \nWelles' Ford comes slowly down the street.  CHILDREN in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups. \nWelles parallel parks. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles turns off the engine. He's watching a HOUSE on the other side of the street.  The house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top, quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a GARAGE underneath, plastic PINK FLAMINGOS on the small lawn. \nCars pass in the street.  Welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk.  He slumps down a little in his seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side mirror, rolling up the window. \nWelles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun, pours bullets out and pockets them.  He picks up a PAPER BAG off the passenger seat and opens it. \nHe takes out a long, thin metal FILE, pulling off the shrink wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb. \nKeeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along the gun's inner barrel. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- LATER DAY \nWelles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house. He looks in his side mirror... \nThere's a large CAR coming down the block with its turn signal on.  Welles slumps a little lower. \nThe car passes, slowing.  The GARAGE DOOR of the quaint house begins to open. \nWelles watches... Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head, but he's huge.  It's a good bet it's Machine. Beside him in the passenger seat is a GREY HAIRED OLD WOMAN. \nThe car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's garage.  After a moment, the OLD WOMAN comes from the garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses.  She goes to the sidewalk, checks her MAILBOX, finds it empty. \nWelles watches. \nThe old woman goes back to the garage.  She goes inside. The garage door closes behind her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- NIGHT \nWelles still watches the house.  There's a light on in one of the second floor windows, curtains closed. \nWelles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake. \nAt the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture window.  Looks like a living room or dining room.  The old woman comes to sit at a table. \nWelles takes binoculars off the front seat... \nTHROUGH BINOCULARS \nThe old woman says something to someone we cannot see. She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of her.  After a moment, someone joins her... \nIt's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge forearms.  The lacy curtains of the window block part of our view, so we never see his face. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles lowers the binoculars, still watching. \nThrough the window across the street, Machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  The old woman smiles up at him, says something. \nMachine goes to light two candles on the table with matches, then goes back to stand beside the old woman. \nMachine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  The old woman starts to eat. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  WELLES' CAR -- DAY \nDawn light is just breaking.  Welles has fallen asleep, slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly. \nWelles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  He calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features. \nACROSS THE STREET \nThe quaint house's garage door begins to rise. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles sees this, keeps low, watching... The big car backs out into the street.  The old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone. \nWelles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror. \nON THE STREET \nWelles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him.  He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around. \nAhead, the garage door begins to close. \nWelles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous.  The garage door's halfway down... \nWelles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes. \nABOVE \nIn ONE WINDOW of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut. \nINT.  QUAINT HOUSE, GARAGE -- DAY \nWelles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off. The garage is dark, full of BOXES and JUNK.  Welles moves towards the door to the house. \nINT.  QUAINT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY \nMachine, in T-shirt and jeans, seen only from behind, comes to a DRESSER and opens a bottom drawer.  His huge hands push clothing aside, digging deep to the bottom of the drawer, taking out the WRESTLING MASK. \nMachine throws the chair, runs, leaps... Machine lands on the table, crawls to the far edge, GRABBING down with his meaty fists as Welles moves forward... \nUnder the table, Welles jerks back, avoiding, then rises, extending his knees, PUSHING upwards from underneath... \nWelles FLIPS the table, throwing Machine to the floor... \nWelles charges towards the kitchen door, falls, gets up... Machine gets to his feet... \nIN THE KITCHEN \nWelles SHOVES through the swinging door... Machine BURSTS through, catching Welles, TACKLING him... \nWelles hits the floor with Machine on top.  Machine begins to rein PUNCHES down on Welles, head and back... \nWelles tries to cover up, taking a real beating... \nMachine rises, gripping Welles, LIFTING him, THROWS him... \nWelles SMASHES into shelves of knick-knacks over the kitchen sink, SHATTERING a WINDOW, landing on the sink and counter. \nMachine comes to grip Welles again, drags him across the counter, KNOCKING EVERYTHING to the floor... Machine SWINGS Welles, releases him... \nWelles SLAMS the refrigerator and slumps to the ground, tries to stay conscious, trying weakly to get back up... Machine comes to Welles, gets on his knees... \nMachine wraps his arm around Welles' neck from behind, gets him in a CHOKE HOLD, tightens his grip, cutting off Welles airway with his forearm... \nWelles tries to break Machine's impossible grip with one hand, begins searching the floor with his other hand... frantically feeling for anything he can use... \nWelles' face is blood red... \nWelles' hand grasps desperately... finds a FORK, grips it... \nWelles SWINGS the fork back, STABS it into Machine's thigh! \nMachine SCREAMS, releases Welles and falls back, reaching around to the fork... \nWelles gets to his knees, sucking air, turns to look... \nMachine crawls away, pulls the fork out with trembling fingers.  Beyond him, there's the BASEMENT DOOR. \nWelles gets to his feet, looking... He grabs a FRYING PAN off the counter, gripping it in both hands and moving towards Machine... \nMachine's getting up... Welles BASHES Machine in the face with an upward swing of the frying pan... \nMachine is sent backpedaling, CRASHING into the oven! \nWelles drops the pan, leaps over Machine, to the door... \nIN THE BASEMENT \nWelles comes down the stairs, falls when he gets to the bottom, barely has any strength left.  He looks all directions, sees the LAUNDRY CHUTE in the ceiling... \nWelles gets up, stumbling, falls to his knees at the PILE of dirty LAUNDRY, starts digging through it, searching desperately, throwing clothing aside... \nBehind, Machine comes down the stairs, a bloody mess... \nWelles searches the laundry pile... \nMachine reaches the bottom of the stairs, heading for Welles.  Welles turns, has the GUN in hand, FIRES TWICE... HITTING Machine in the shoulder and stomach, knocking Machine a few steps backwards... \nWelles FIRES... \nMachine's HIT in the CHEST, falling back, into hanging laundry, pulling down the clothes line and sheets... \nMachine hits the ground, wrapped in sheets. \nWelles stands, still aiming the gun, pulls the trigger on an empty chamber.  Out of bullets. \nMachine's trying to pull free from the sheets, trying to get back up to his feet.  Welles lets out a sob, drops the gun, walking to Machine... \nWelles climbs onto Machine from behind, takes clothing line in hand, starts wrapping the cord around Machine's throat... \nWelles pulls back on the clothes line, pulling it tight... \nMachine tries to get his fingers around the cord.  Welles stands, pulling tighter, putting a foot on Machine's back, pulling the clothes line with all his might... \nThe cord's cutting into Welles' hand, drawing blood. \nMachine, face down, lets out a gurgling sound, struggling, struggling... till he finally stops moving. \nWelles releases the cord, takes a step back, breathing hard, trembling.  He looks around the basement. \nWelles walks to pick up his gun, replaces the gun in his holster.  He stands looking at Machine. \nWelles walks to Machine, bends, grasps Machine wrestling mask, pulling it off.  He rolls Machine over... \nWelles stares down at Machine.  We never see Machine's face. \nINT.  KITCHEN -- DAY \nWelles comes up from the basement, slow, hurting.  He looks around at the damage done, looks down to see he's still holding Machine's mask.  He drops it. \nEXT.  QUAINT HOUSE -- DAY \nWelles crosses the street, going to his car.  He gets into his car, starts it, pulls out and drives away. \nEXT.  WELLES' HOUSE -- DAY \nBIRDS SING.  KIDS are kicking around a soccer ball down the street.  Welles' Ford arrives, pulls into the driveway. \nINT.  WELLES' HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY -- DAY \nWelles comes in the front door, still a horrible mess. \nWELLES Hello?!  Amy? \n", "test1_input": "ON THE SCREEN: the FACES of TEENAGERS, boys and girls, one after the other, MISSING... MISSING... MISSING... \nINT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles searches the SHELVES of the LIBRARY.  He begins taking down various books... \n\"Motion Picture Photography.\"  \"Film Stocks and Physical Characteristics.\"  \"Super 8 Filmmaking.\" \nINT.  CLEVELAND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- LATER -- MONTAGE \nIn Welles' notepad: \"SUPRAlux 544.\" Welles sits paging through technical photography books. \nINT. WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE \nWelles has the 8MM FILM threaded through the projector.  He turns the CLATTERING projector on and sits, watching. \nON THE WALL: FLASH FRAMES, then... the skinny GIRL in a negligee, sitting on the bed.  The CAMERA'S SPOTLIGHT casts long shadows.  The girl stares, oblivious... \nON THE WALL: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and the MASKED MAN enters, wearing the ghastly WRESTLING MASK.  The man goes to stand in front of the girl.  He seems to be saying something.  The FILM halts. \nWelles sits forward, hand on the projector.  He's seen something.  He PLAYS the FILM in REVERSE... \nON THE WALL: the Masked Man walks backwards, away from the girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting... \nWelles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the image.  He ADVANCES the film FRAME BY FRAME... \nFRAME BY FRAME... as the bathroom door opens, and the Masked Man enters... FRAME BY FRAME... as the Masked Man moves forward... door closing behind him... STOP... \nFREEZE FRAME: a THIRD MAN is reflected in the bathroom mirror.  Grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes. \nWelles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost ethereal image of the Third Man. \nEXT.  CLEVELAND STREET CORNER -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles is in a PHONE BOOTH, feeds many quarters into the phone, waiting, looking at his notepad. \nWELLES (into PHONE) Hello, Mrs. Christian?  Tom Welles. Here's where we stand.  I checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544.  The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92... (listens) Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary... \nINT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles is back at the computer, alone, drinking coffee. ON THE COMPUTER: endless PHOTOS of MISSING CHILDREN. The PHONE CALL CONTINUES in VOICE OVER: \nWELLES (V.O., cont) Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did.  First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise. Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo... \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE \nWelles just stands, staring at the PHOTO of the GIRL. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.  Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated. No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around... \nINT.  CLEVELAND BAR -- NIGHT -- MONTAGE \nLocal bar.  Welles sits drinking with the archive's director, talking, smiling at something the director said. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) There don't seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself, but I'm going to have to be careful to leave them intact... \nINT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles is tired, unshaven.  He's moved on to the physical files, at one table, looking through HUNDREDS of MISSING PERSON BULLETINS.  Secretaries tend to other files. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police. That way I don't have to explain why my prints are on it... \nINT.  WELLES' ROOM -- DAY -- MONTAGE \nWelles sits with the PROJECTOR ON, watching the film again. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) There were three men.  Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but I caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror.  It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching... \nON THE WALL: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers.  Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the CAMERA MOVES to find Masked Man standing at a table with THREE large BOWIE KNIFES laid out... \nWelles notices something, puts the projector on FREEZE FRAME. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) So, there were three.  They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to.  That's all for now... except, I feel I should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago... \nWelles walks to the frozen IMAGE on the wall.  It shows the Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades. \nWELLES (V.O., cont) Well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was. (listens) I will, I'll keep trying. Goodbye. \nV.O. PHONE CALL ends with the SOUND of the PHONE HANGING UP. \nON THE WALL: there's a DARK SPOT on Masked Man's hand, on the arch between his index finger and thumb.  Grainy and hard to make out, but looks like a small TATTOO. \nINT.  WELLES ROOM, BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- END MONTAGE \nWelles has the 8MM FILM threaded into his photo enlarger, projecting the IMAGE we just saw down onto the baseboard. \nHe re-frames, CLOSER ON the masked Man's hand, REFOCUSING... the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small STAR tattoo on the back of Masked Man's hand. \nINT.  MISSING PERSONS ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY \nWelles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven, drinking coffee, flipping through smaller PICTURES of MISSING CHILDREN in one drawer, one by one by one... \nWelles rolls his neck.  He looks to see the archive's director in the doorway.  The director nods, leaving. Welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nTITLE CARD:      three weeks later \nEXT.  OFFICE BUILDING, MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE -- DAY \nIn the lot, Welles gets wearily from his car, smoking.  He tosses the cigarette, gets a Thermos off the front seat. \nINT.  MISSING PERSON ARCHIVE, FILE ROOM -- DAY \nWelles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled \"North Carolina 1992,\" flipping through picture cards.  The FACES of TEENAGERS: a happy BOY with blue eyes... a red headed GIRL with freckles... a ruddy faced BOY... a pretty GIRL with a ribbon in her hair... a black GIRL in a pink dress... a blonde haired BOY with curly hair... \n", "test1_true": "He backtracks to the pretty GIRL with the ribbon in her hair. \nWelles sits straight.  He reaches into his pocket, hands shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the PHOTO he printed of the girl from the snuff film.  It's her. \nWelles compares the two pictures.  She's prettier in the card catalog photo, but it's her. \nWelles can't believe it, looks around.  Secretaries at other files don't even know he's there.  Welles pulls out his notepad, scribbling down INFORMATION off the card... \nWriting the girl's name: \"Mary Anne Matthews.\" \nEXT.  INTERSTATE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT \nWelles, car races past, alone on the dark freeway. \nEXT.  FAYETTEVILLE CITYSCAPE -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY \nAnother small city.

The date at the top: \"July 12, 1992.\" \nTIME CUT: \nNEWSPRINT BLURS past... stops on a page of OBITUARIES. Top of the page: \"September 4, 1993.\" \nCLOSE ON: \"Mathews, Robert Steven, 1948-1993.\" \"Dead in an apparent suicide, Robert Mathews was discovered yesterday morning in the basement of...\" \nEXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FAYETTEVILLE SUBURB -- DAY \nA tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  Welles' car parks in front of one HOUSE with a neglected lawn. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles, clean shaven, picks a CLIPBOARD with a file folder and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  He drums his fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's registration, other papers and \"Jiffy-Lube\" service reports, uses them to pad the file. \nWelles takes a BOTTLE of COLOGNE from his pocket.  He considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck. \nEXT.  MATHEWS HOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- DAY \nWelles knocks, clipboard in hand.  A sad, middle-aged woman answers, MRS. MATHEWS, looking through the screen door. \nMRS MATHEWS Yes... ? \nWELLES (smiles) Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator... \nWelles holds up his identification only long enough for Mrs. Mathews to see it looks official. \nWELLES I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. \nMRS MATHEWS I don't understand, who are... ? \nWELLES I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before? \nMRS MATHEWS Yes, but... \nWELLES These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... (holds up clipboard) ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh... \nWelles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page... \nWELLES What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere... \nMRS MATHEWS Neil... Neil Cole. \nWELLES (pretends he found it) Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call? \nMRS MATHEWS No. \nWELLES (looking on legal pad) Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ? \nMrs. Mathews stares, nods. \nWELLES I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ? (looks at watch) Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright? \nMrs. Mathews looks him up and down. \nEXT.  DAIRY QUEEN RESTAURANT -- DAY \nWelles and Mrs. Mathews eat at a PICNIC TABLE on the patio. \nWELLES It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope. \nMRS MATHEWS They hired you.  You're like, a private detective? \nWELLES That's exactly what I am. \nMrs. Mathews chews, staring off into the distance. \nMRS MATHEWS I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV. \n", "test1_id": 300, "test2_input": "Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed. \nDino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it. \nMachine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe.  Welles falls to his knees, holding his face. Eddie PUNCHES Welles in the head. \nEDDIE You're a dead man. \nDINO VELVET Leave him alone. \nEDDIE Fuck off. \nEddie PUNCHES Welles in the kidney.  Welles tries to protect himself.  Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back... \nEDDIE What the fuck... ! \nDINO I promised him to Machine. \nEddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him. \nEDDIE ... sorry... \nDINO VELVET First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles... \nWelles looks up through tears... Dino drops the 8MM FILM on the floor, takes a small bottle of lighter fluid from his pocket.  Longdale comes to watch. \nWelles watches helpless, agonizing... \nWELLES Don't... please... \nDino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid, takes out matches, light one, drops it... \nThe 8MM FILM goes up in flame... \nWelles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself towards the flame, dragging the bed... \nThe film is destroyed by flame... \nWelles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut. \nDINO VELVET And so it ends.  It's as if she never existed. \nWelles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet. \nDINO VELVET Don't blame yourself.  You were in way over your head. \nHe looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film... Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage... \nWELLES Motherfuckers.  Small time, motherfuckers... !  Tell me something... \nWelles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support. \nWELLES I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it?  Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?  One fuckload of money... \nWelles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury. \nWELLES So, what are you all still doing small time, huh?  What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ? \nEddie and Dino look to Longdale. \nEDDIE What's he talking about? \nWELLES One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had... \nLongdale's getting very nervous. \nLONGDALE He's lying. \nWELLES Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself? \nEddie walks towards Longdale... \nEDDIE What the fuck's he talking about? \nLongdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and Eddie, scared... \nLONGDALE Stay away from me. \nDINO VELVET What's going on, Longdale?  Did this happen? \nEDDIE You sell us short, you fuck? \nLONGDALE Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now! \nEddie slowly takes out his gun, seething. \nLONGDALE Put it on the ground, kick it here... \nEddie puts the gun down, kicks it... Longdale picks it up, throws it far away. \nEDDIE You fucking lawyer... \nLONGDALE Move back!  All of you... move! \nMachine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car with tinted windows parked across the warehouse... \nDINO VELVET What were you thinking? \nWelles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away from Longdale.  Longdale's gun hand is shaky... \nWelles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch... \nLongdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio so he can get to the car... \nLONGDALE Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now... \n", "test2_true": "LONGDALE I'm leaving. \nEDDIE You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it? \nDINO VELVET You betrayed us. \nLONGDALE Stay where you are! \nMachine edges forward, holding his hands in the air. Longdale brandishes the gun... \nLONGDALE Keep back! \nMachine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay... \nDINO VELVET You're not gonna live through this. \nWelles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in the cuff, bed screeching across the floor... \nMachine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder, touches the handle of a huge KNIFE sheathed to his back. \nLONGDALE Our business is done, I'm leaving, no one's going to stop me... \nLongdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to make a run for it.  Dino Velvet takes a step forward... \nDINO VELVET Fuck you! \nMachine unsheathes the KNIFE and THROWS... \nTHUNK!  The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and Longdale's gun FIRES... \nDino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face! \nDino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his face, blood pouring out between his fingers. \nLongdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged out in surprise.  He looks down at the knife in his chest. \nMachine lets out a SCREAM, runs to Dino... \nMachine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold him.  Dino's screaming, squirming frantically... \nLongdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth... \nEDDIE Fuck. \nEddie comes to look down at the Longdale.  Longdale falls back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw. \nWelles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table... \nEddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling... \nDino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up... \nEddie runs towards Welles. \nDino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still. \nMachine rises, looking at Dino.  Tears come out from Machine's eyes and roll down his mask. \nOne last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle. \nWelles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the socket, desperately clawing towards the table... The table is mere feet away... \nEddie arrives, KICK Welles in the ribs... \nWelles recoils.  Eddies KICKS again.  Welles curls into a ball.  Eddie KICKS again... \nMACHINE (O.S.) NO! \nEddie stops, looks to Machine. \nMACHINE He's mine! \nMachine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife... Machine starts this way... \nEddie backs from Welles.  Welles looks up, trying to shake off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming... \nWelles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate... Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket... \nWELLES No, no, no... please, don't kill me... please... ! \nMachine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by the hair, brings the knife hand back... \nEDDIE Do him good. \nWelles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach... \nMachine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward... \nMachine's knife clatters to the ground. \nEddie's eyes go wide. \nMachine hits the floor, clutching his guts. \nWelles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off... \nEddie moves forward, furious... \nWelles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off. \nWELLES Back off, Eddie... \nWelles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table. Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away. \n", "test2_id": 301, "test3_input": "WELLES How much did he pay you? \nEDDIE Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker. \nWELLES That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her? \nEDDIE It was a lot of fucking money. \nWelles stands and paces, despairing.  He picks up a LAMP and throws it, SHATTERS a MIRROR, keeps pacing... \nWELLES So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out. \nEDDIE Something like that. \nWELLES What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ? \nEDDIE What the fuck do you want from me? \nWELLES I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her! \nEDDIE Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares! \nWelles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding it in both hands, SWINGS -- SLAMS Eddie across the face... \nEddie's stunned, lips bleeding.  He faces forward. \nEDDIE You wanted to know, now you know. \nWelles SWINGS the Thomas Guide -- POUNDS Eddie's face again. \nWelles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun, leaves the room... \nINT.  EDDIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY \nWelles enters, starts looking through DRAWERS, searching. He finds SILVERWARE, selects a serrated STEAK KNIFE... \nINT.  EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nWelles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar, drags him to the floor, face down.  Welles stands on Eddie's neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands. \nEDDIE That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose.  Be a man. \nWelles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie... \nWELLES Show me! \nEddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position, looks at the Thomas Guide. \nWELLES Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it. \nEDDIE Why? \nWELLES Because we're going there. \nEXT.  134 FREEWAY -- DAY \nWelles' rental car SPEEDS down the highway, east towards Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon. \nEXT.  MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY -- DAY \nWelles' car travels a winding HIGHWAY that serpentines up into the scenic, forested SAN BERNADINO MOUNTAINS. \nEXT.  BIG BEAR -- DUSK \nThe sun is low.  Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by wilderness on all sides.  Welles' car follows a TWO-LANE ROADWAY that runs along the lake's southern shore. \nWelles' car passes sporadic SUMMER HOMES and CABINS. \nEXT.  DESERTED ROADWAY -- NIGHT \nHeavy forests border close to the road.  Welles' car travels alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown gravel DRIVEWAY with a rusty CHAIN strung across it. \nIN THE CAR \nWelles leans forward to look up at an old SIGN of broken neon and peeled paint: \"Big Bear Motor Lodge.\" \nWelles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse... \nON THE ROADWAY \nWelles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes against the chain, BACKING... till the CHAIN SNAPS. \nWelles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway... \nEXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT \nWelles' car comes down the driveway, into a small LOT. \nIN THE CAR \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: headlights reveal what's left of the abandoned MOTOR LODGE, a REGISTRATION OFFICE at the center with attached wings of rooms on both sides. \nThe LEFT WING of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out skeleton.  What remains of the OFFICE and RIGHT WING is boarded over, falling apart.  No window has gone unbroken. \nIN THE LOT \nWelles turns out headlights and parks. He gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  A CAR is HEARD. HEADLIGHTS can be seen a good distance away through the forest as the CAR PASSES. \nWelles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it. Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged. \nINT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge. Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  Welles pushes Eddie forward, gun out. \nWelles turns on his penlight FLASHLIGHT, shining it into the room.  There dead leaves all over the floor.  The room's empty except for a CHAIR lying on its side. \n", "test3_true": "EDDIE What are we doing here? \nWelles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot... \nThe bathroom's cracked MIRROR reflects the penlight and Welles' palely lit face. \nWELLES That night... you didn't have to be in the room, but you were. (looks to Eddie) Why?  Why did you watch? \nEddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits. \nEDDIE I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before. \nWELLES You enjoy it? \nEDDIE Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money. \nWELLES Tell me what happened. \nEDDIE What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop... \nWELLES Nobody saw you bring her in? \nEDDIE There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work. \nWELLES What did you do with her body? \nEDDIE Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. \nWELLES Show me. \nEXT.  BIG BEAR MOTOR LODGE -- NIGHT \nEddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and flashlight, into the dense forest... \nEDDIE What are you thinking you're gonna do... ? \nWelles shoves Eddie ahead. \nWELLES Keep moving. \nEDDIE Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ? \nFURTHER ON \nWelles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest... \nEDDIE You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing... \nWELLES Stop talking. \nEDDIE You got absolute zero. \nWELLES Show me where you buried her. \nEDDIE I don't know... (nods to forest) ... out there somewhere. \nWELLES Where?  Show me where. \nEDDIE I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine. \nWelles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor. \nEDDIE You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.  You can't do anything. \nWelles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious. \nWELLES I can kill you.  I can leave you out here, just like you left her. \nEddie's not backing down. \nEDDIE Do it. \nWELLES Don't think I won't. \nEDDIE Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy? \nWELLES Easy enough for you. \nEDDIE I never killed anyone. \nWELLES That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you \"felt like it.\"  Almost makes you worse. \nEDDIE What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ? \nEddie walks towards Welles.  Welles backs away... \nEDDIE Where you going?  You're the one with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless enough?  Come on... \nEddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face. \nEDDIE Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name?  Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it.  Fucking do it! \nWelles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's forehead, pulls back the hammer... \nEddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes. \nWelles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger... \nINT.  MOTOR LODGE ROOM -- NIGHT \nEddie's thrown face down to the floor.  Welles comes to sit on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun, takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them... \nEDDIE You pussy. \n", "test3_id": 302}

MA, PA, AND AL (together) Al's tryin' to go away... She jus' got sassy... All I aimed to do... 
TOM (taking the jack-handle) Awright, you can fight it out later. Right now we got to hustle. Where's Connie? 
There is a silence that stops Tom in his rush of preparation. 
MA (quietly) Connie's gone. (Indicating Rosasharn) Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this. 
PA (angrily) Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be-- 
MA Pa! Shh! 
PA How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he? 
TOM (looking to Rosasharn) Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck. (He kneels beside Rosasharn. Gently) Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright. 
ROSASHARN (uncovering her face) Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live. 
TOM Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. (He pats her awkwardly) 
The scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE, at night. The jalopies are lumbering up on the road, one after the other, as the migrants scatter before the threatened invasion. 
IN THE JOAD TRUCK, Tom is helping Rosasharn into the front seat, beside Ma. The others are aboard except Al. Tom hands Al a wrench. 
TOM Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it. 
PA (from truck) I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'. 
TOM (to Al) Give 'im a fryin' pan. (He gets into the driver's seat and starts the truck) 
In the FRONT SEAT of the truck, Tom drives, Ma sits in the middle, Rosasharn on the other side. 
ROSASHARN (hopefully) Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us. 
MA Maybe that's jus' what he done. 
TOM Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad. 
MA Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me. 
TOM I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency. 
MA You promised, Tommy. 
TOM I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am. 
MA You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear. 
TOM What's that--detour? 
As he slows down the truck, we see that half of the ROAD is blocked with boards and red lanterns. a group of men swarm around the Joad truck as it stops. A leader leans in Tom's window. 
LEADER Where you think you're goin'? 
In the FRONT SEAT of the truck Tom's hand reaches for the jack-handle on the seat at his side but Ma's hand clutches his arm in a steel grip. 
TOM Well-- (then in a servile whine) --we're strangers here. We heard about they's work in a place called Tulare. 
LEADER Well, you're goin' the wrong way, an' what's more, we don't want no more Okies in this town. We ain't got work enough for them that are already here. 
Tom's arm trembles as he tries to pull it away, but Ma holds on tight. 
TOM Which way is it at, mister? 
LEADER You turn right aroun' and head north. An' don't come back till the cotton's ready. 
TOM Yes, sir.

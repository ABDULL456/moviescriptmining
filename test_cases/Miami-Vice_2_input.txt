ISABELLA (O.S.) (to Crockett) Put your guns on the table... (enters, sits) If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here. 
CROCKETT Really?  So, what is this, a party? 
Crockett + Tubbs put down their weapons. 
TUBBS We'll have room service wipe up the furniture...and bring drinks. 
Isabella says something in French.  The Cops ease-up. Isabella's personal security frisks Crockett + Tubbs and remain.  Paramilitary leave. 
CROCKETT Glad we came.  This place is a lot of fun if you're Doctors Without Borders.  So...? 
Isabella takes off her glasses.  She's Afro-Cuban. 
ISABELLA I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall. 
TUBBS Define small. 
ISABELLA Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is (beat) Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. (beat) For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load. (beat) Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... (beat) No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil... (beat) That's the deal. 
CROCKETT I thought we had to meet the Man. 
ISABELLA You do. 
CROCKETT When? 
ISABELLA Right now. 
As she leaves... 
INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS - NIGHT 
in the back seat on a rural road.  Isabella is not with them. One of her Russians is.  In the front seat, his SMG is ready; his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs. 
EXT. ROAD - CARAVAN 
A military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with Haitian paramilitary. 
INT. MERCEDES - TUBBS 
They approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police roadblock's ahead. 
CROCKETT 
has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his waist. 
TUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL 
That's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone. Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock. Crockett gets tense... 
TUBBS 
watches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to zero. 
EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS 
stop the caravan.  Is this turning bad? 
INT. CAR - CROCKETT 
alarmed. 
EXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS 
check under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons. Salute.  Usher the convoy past. 
INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS 
exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by Haitian military. 
EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR 
is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security. Mercedes pulls forward... 
CROCKETT 
eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a dope deal.

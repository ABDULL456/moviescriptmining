{"train": "THE FLINTSTONES \nWritten by STEVEN E. DE SOUZA \nBased on characters created by JOE BARBERA & WILLIAM HANNA \nEarly Draft - September 1987 \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nTHE FLINTSTONES \nFADE IN: 1   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1 \nFRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry wall. \n2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2 looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time... Millerock time! Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the workday -- \n3   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              3 FRED YABBA DABBA DO -- ! Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only motor (his feet), slows to allow a \"time clock\" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and OVER -- MUSIC (V.O.) 'Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They're a modern Stone age fam-i-ly --' \n-- And so forth, as for the first time in \"his-tor-y\" we see the Flintstones' OPENING CREDITS live! 4   TIGHT ON A MAILBOX                                         4 \nreading \"FLINTSTONE.\" We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the saber-toothed cat. Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY, BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop in! (CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                 4 Fred's feet slap on the street as the car starts up -- \nMUSIC (V.O.) 'From the Town of Bedrock They're a page right Out of his-tor-y -- ' 5   DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK                              5 \nFred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell \"speaker\" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma. (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop- your-popcorn reality: THE FLINTSTONES And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we -- DISSOLVE TO: 6   AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN                       6 \nDew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (The third one out carries a little suitcase.) \nCAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange, hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven- foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus. It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.) \nSuddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the Xenosaurus. \n7   NEW ANGLE                                                  7 \nDazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and we see -- Bedrock! (CONTINUED) \n7    CONTINUED:                                                 7 Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light. \nFRED (pause) You invented fire? BARNEY I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas -- FRED Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get? \nFred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay. \nFRED If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano... \nBARNEY Maybe, Fred.   But first... \nHe uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp. BARNEY Let me try some of that smoke on your car. \nCUT TO: \n25   INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY                         25 We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. \nFred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone. BARNEY (as he works) -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood. \nBARNEY -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries... \nFRED (impressed) Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney? \nBARNEY Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, \"tastes\" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin. \n26   NEW ANGLE                                                   26 \nFred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits. FRED Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to -- (CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:                                                     26 He stops as Barney cranks up the weight on a ratchet, proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite himself, we... CUT TO: \n27   BETTY'S CAR - TRAVELING                                        27 The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the kids' faces are messy again. Working together with beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the rear armrests and door handles. BETTY (in mid-speech, driving) ... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids. BETTY No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs. \nShe wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids, who immediately run into the schoolyard. \nMRS. GRANITE (approaching) Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted to thank you personally. \nBETTY You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day. \nMRS. GRANITE No, no, I mean for all your wonderful support the past few years. It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring. (CONTINUED) \n27   CONTINUED:                                                     27 From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR- RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING. \nMRS. GRANITE On the other hand... \n32   THE POLICE CAR                                                 32 cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the \"BRAKES,\" sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning. FELDSPAR Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day. FRED Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest... \nFred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks... 33   ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD                                            33 \nThere's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER. (CONTINUED) \n33   CONTINUED:                                                       33 FELDSPAR (O.S.) Forget it, Flintstone. This time I got you dead to rights -- Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips. \n34   BACK TO SCENE                                                    34 Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner. \nFELDSPAR Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws. \nGravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips. RADAR BIRD Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- ! \nThe Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind. Feldspar catches the watch, startled. FRED Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- (quickly) -- justbeonourway -- ! \nA new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away. FELDSPAR Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back here -- ! CUT TO: \n35   EXT. BEDROCK BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                  35 Betty and Wilma   have just pulled up. We notice that next to their legal   spot, a big limousine is parked in a \"no parking\" zone.    But our law-abiding Betty in the next space now drops   a stone coin in a parking meter. 36   CLOSE ON THE METER                                               36 \nInside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It \"bites\" the coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer. (CONTINUED) \n36   CONTINUED:                                                     36 LITTLE BIRD (with a sigh) Four years in accounting school for this... 37   INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                        37 \nIt's absolutely   mobbed. Customers push past each other with armloads of   food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from above or are on   display behind the counter. MORRIS THE BUTCHER looks up   from the chaos and manages a weak smile for the girls. BETTY Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets? \nMORRIS Ah, my two loveliest customers. It's this darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R... people are buying everything I got to feed their dinos... MRS. SLATE Young man, if you're through flirting, I'd like some service. 38   NEW ANGLE                                                      38 \nREVEALING MRS. SLATE, who stands there, impatient and overdressed. MORRIS Of course, Mrs. Slate.   Just take a number. Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile. WILMA Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate. \nMorris reacts with relief.    Mrs. Slate reacts with a blank look. \nWILMA (prompting) We met at the quarry picnic? MRS. SLATE Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein. \nShe turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the counter again. Wilma burns. \n(CONTINUED) \n38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 MORRIS Ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher. Mrs. R, what'll it be? BETTY Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks. MORRIS Gino?   We got any dodo bird? \nGINO turns, looks at his end of the counter. GINO There's one left -- and it's the last one! MORRIS Good. (handing him the note) Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with this. \n46   INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW                        46 The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project. There's acres of little development houses, then some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces. \nNear this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con- struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks coffee from a \"Boss\" mug, listens with growing impatience to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer- curial moods. LAVA Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection... it intersects here with -- SLATE -- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose? I've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime! LAVA You'll be bankrupt in six months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. 47   EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT                                 47 Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides. \nBARNEY (to himself) Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... (writing) ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees -- \n48   FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR                     48 A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in- side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the... \n49   QUARRY WALL - ABOVE                                          49 -- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts balanced on a boulder. \n50   WIDER                                                        50 Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.) \nPYRITE Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly. \nPILTDOWN (calling up) Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall. 51   BELOW                                                        51 \nWorkers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down. People grab for their construction helmets. FRED Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow. FRED All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers! \nPILTDOWN Yeah?   Sez who? \nFRED Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101. \nPILTDOWN Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break. So... (a nasty grin) ... I'm breakin' some snacks. \nHe swings the wrecking ball again. \n52   UP ABOVE                                                    52 This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones' whip. The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its foundation -- \n53   PILTDOWN'S DINO                                             53 SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain -- \n54   WIDER                                                       54 Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.   Fred runs to grab the dino's reins. \nFRED Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post. FRED (calling up to the cab) You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow! \nPILTDOWN (leaping down) You've been asking for this, Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your fat butt -- FRED Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- (sotto, very sincere) -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- 55   THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK                                55 \nIt is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down. \n56   BACK TO SCENE                                               56 BARNEY Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first. PILTDOWN Why should we? (CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                  56 BARNEY It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime. FRED Yeah.  That's right. (realizing, a glare at Barney) I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. (turning, shouting) Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it... \n70   CONTINUED:                                                      70 BARNEY Hey, nice going, Fred.   You even got the spare -- FRED Barney, shut up -- (turning) Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw. SLATE (eying the men) For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock. (pacing, angry) Our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. And then something like this happens ... I want to know how! A cacophony of voices starts to answer. SLATE Shut up! (in the sudden silence) I want one person to answer me: (waving the car hood) Who's responsible for this? 71   PILTDOWN                                                        71 \nnudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table. It falls on Fred's foot. Fred starts to scream and Piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth. \nPILTDOWN (quickly) It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate! \nPYRITE That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone! BARNEY That's a lie, Mr. Slate! \nSLATE Who are you? \n(CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:                                                        71 BARNEY (pointing to his forms) B. Rubble. White male personal reference -- SLATE (pushing Barney aside) Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes.       Piltdown and Pyrite smirk. \nSLATE (pumping his hand) Congratulations! \nFRED                                PILTDOWN Huh?                               What? SLATE This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business! (testing it) It's strong -- (twirling it) -- Light -- (bending it) -- Resilient -- It rebounds, \"SPROINGING\" him on the chin.        He recovers, shakes it off. \nSLATE Where on earth did you get it? \nFRED Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- (quickly) -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn? \nBARNEY Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the \"Slate and me are just like this\" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate. (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              71 BARNEY (reluctant) Sure, Fred, right, right. Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood. \nSLATE The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious. \nSLATE (a man in love) Light  as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a  child could handle this... Lava,  we could cut construction costs  in half... in quarters... in uh...  whatchacallit -- LAVA (patiently) Eighths -- SLATE Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call this stuff? FRED Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- (hesitating, sotto) -- Barney, what do I call it? BARNEY (sotto) Fibrerock, Fred... FRED -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! (realizing) I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'! \nSLATE (rolling it over his tongue) 'Fibrerock'? 'Fibrerock'? (playing with it) 'Fib-bre-rock' -- \nSlate's staff make disparaging noises. (CONTINUED) \n71   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                71 SLATE I love it! \nSLATE'S STAFF (instantly reversing themselves) Love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know? (Etc...) Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney. \nSLATE (to Lava) You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies. \nBARNEY Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement. SLATE Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it. \nThe girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands' smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms. Betty paces, looks at the clock. \n(CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                     75 WILMA (seeing this) It's not like the boys to be so late. BETTY Unless they were forced to go bowling again. Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'? \nWILMA Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible -- \nBETTY Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today... WILMA No kidding. (indicating the forms) Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable -- BETTY I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too? \nWILMA Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and... BETTY And? \nWILMA And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can? \nBetty smiles, touched.    Then reality intrudes again. BETTY What do we tell the boys? \nWILMA What's wrong with the truth? (CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               75 BETTY We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand? WILMA (pause) Maybe we could rephrase it... Suddenly the door bursts open.     Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers. \nFRED AND BARNEY Surprise! \nPause. \nBETTY Flowers? WILMA Rock candy?   That's nice, but... why? \nFRED Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change. \nWILMA (sotto) Not anymore you don't... BARNEY (presenting flowers) Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall. \nBETTY Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today. \nBARNEY Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him. \nFred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock. \nFRED Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- ! \n(CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              75 WILMA (observing this) Have you been drinking? In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view. \n80   CONTINUED:                                                  80 BARNEY (rising) My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... (pause) ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down. 81   NEW ANGLE                                                   81 \nBarney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big \"VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE\" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a \"thumbs up,\" and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. \nFred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him. FRED (reading, at first wooden, then confident) Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux... BARNEY (hissing) -- crucible -- \n(CONTINUED) \n81   CONTINUED:                                                   81 FRED (grateful) -- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor. \n82   PILTDOWN AND PYRITE                                          82 \nThe only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as Fred passes them...

The Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike. We notice that most (if not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry. \n84   AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER                                        84 It descends.    It consists of a bent snout creature which \"cranks\" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it. The monkeys grab   the pins with their tails, straighten them up. Then the    shelf cranks back up. 85   OTHER END OF ALLEY                                           85 \nNow it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls... another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc. The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame. LODGE MEMBER Congratulations, Fred. \nFRED Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone. \nBARNEY Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                   85 FRED But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches -- \n86   UNDER THE COUNTER                                            86 where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD -- \n87   BACK TO SCENE                                                87 Fred uses this creature to open several beers. \nFRED (during this) Here you go, boys, nice and frosty... \"BOTTLE OPENER\" CREATURE (LIZARD) (aside) Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different... Fred tosses the \"Opener\" aside -- \n88   UNDER THE COUNTER                                            88 The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re- covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat, exits. 89   BACK TO SCENE                                                89 \nFRED (raising drink) Well, here's to... \nHe looks around, sees -- 90   \"PHOTO\" ON WALL                                              90 \nIt's actually \"dots\" chipped into a stone.

I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind. \nBARNEY I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them. \nFRED Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure \"silent partner\"... CUT TO: \n96   EXT. FLINTSTONE/RUBBLE HOUSES - DAY                            96 Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband. BETTY Barney, wait a minute... 97   CLOSER                                                         97 He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty fixes the knot. BETTY There. That looks more like a captain of industry. BARNEY Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you? \nBETTY Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries. \n(CONTINUED) \n97   CONTINUED:                                                  97 BARNEY Come on, Betty, it's only my first day.

There's something wrong with your lunch -- \nFRED (\"weighing it\") Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. \"F.F\" is embossed on it in gold. WILMA Fit for a king... my king. \nFRED Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it.    Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs. FRED -- Baby, you're the greatest. \nWILMA (kissing him) Good luck. (pause) Watch out for those... you know... hostile takeovers. \nFRED I'm already taken. He moves to the car. \nFRED Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles? (CONTINUED) \n98    CONTINUED:                                                     98 BARNEY Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident. FRED Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned.

Just leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and -- what? When did that happen? Piltdown enters, knocks on the open door. PILTDOWN Mister Lava, the armored car is here. LAVA Armored car...? \nPILTDOWN Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby. You know, for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's. You gotta sign here for it. \nLAVA (into phone) I... I'll get back to you. \nLava comes over, signs the form.    Meanwhile he looks out the window at -- 100   HIS POV - ARMORED CAR                                          100 \nBARNEY I guess so.   You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer. \nLAVA Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off.    Fred and Barney go -- 104   INSIDE TRAILER                                                 104 There're two tiny little desks at the far end, separated by a flimsy divider. The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. (As we watch, somebody dumps a load of debris.) Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of \"Our Founder\" (Slate). 105   BACK TO SCENE                                                  105 Fred and Barney look at all this in turn.

When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, Barney appears and personally \"aims\" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to \"taste\" the mix, he smiles, then shouts -- \nBARNEY Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     \"Fibrefoam\" pours into the mold. 107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107 gets \"winched\" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail. 108   BELOW                                                         108 Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view. \n109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109 as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc. 110   UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY                             110 \nSlate and Lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n111   LONG MATTE SHOT - SLATE QUARRY - LATE AFTERNOON               111 Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's warehouse. We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock table lamps to Fibrerock toilets. MUSIC OUT. \n112   CLOSER - QUARRY YARD                                        112 Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony. SLATE Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone! 113   WORKERS - FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                          113 \nThey cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back. 114   BACK TO SCENE                                               114 SLATE No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it. (pause) That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend. \n115   THE QUARRY YARD                                             115 The workers stand slack-jawed and stunned. \nWORKER #1 Laid off --?

FELDSPAR Flintstone!   Pull over! \nFRED Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smiles, nods... 136   CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET                                           136 He slams them down through the floorboard -- \n137   WIDER                                                          137 Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable.

Suddenly, with a crash, the doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the angry workers rush past them. PILTDOWN (loudly) Now we'll show 'em who's boss! PYRITE They can't push us around! Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody juiced up, and then... when no one is looking... ... they slip out the back! 142   REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT                                         142 Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop -- we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse all around them. \nFinally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build- ing, knocking a hole in the wall. 143   NEW ANGLE                                                      143 \nFred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... \n... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. \nRecovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.

PYRITE Darn that Flintstone and Rubble... they're gonna screw everything up... \nPILTDOWN Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital. Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below. 145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145 \n158   UP ABOVE - BARNEY                                            158 \nDodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word \"REJECT.\" Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club. PYRITE Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head? He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls -- 159   WIDER                                                        159 The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him.

CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride -- \n161   BELOW                                                        161 \nPiltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred!

Even got the spare again... \nThen he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders.

(recovering) I mean... ah, why do you say that? \n(CONTINUED) \n164   CONTINUED:                                                   164 BARNEY It tastes different. \nLAVA Tastes... different? \nBARNEY Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. (smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- LAVA Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? BARNEY Nine days, Mister Lava. \nBarney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of Neolithic 101. PILTDOWN (chuckling) Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants! Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava, who has come out of the office building. LAVA That takes care of the half-pint. (pause) Now to deal with the half-wit. CUT TO: 172   INT. LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY                                        172 Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room. \nFRED (on the move) ... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam -- \nLAVA (pointedly) -- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall. \n(CONTINUED) \n172   CONTINUED:                                                    172 LAVA Flintstone, that... that's a slap in the face of our founder... our employer... our uncle. (turning back, another tone) Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that I'm not capable of running it? \nFRED (nervous) Of course not, Mister Lava. But -- \nLAVA Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says -- LAVA (offering one) ... Cigar? FRED Why, yeah, sure, Jerry. LAVA Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks... (eyeing Fred's girth) ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars.      He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk. \n173   CLOSER - GIZMO                                                173 It's actually a frame supporting a little LIZARD. The Lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty. LIZARD (aside) When they say smoking is bad for your health, they're not kidding... \n174   BACK TO SCENE                                                174 LAVA And others?

Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock... FRED Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say... LAVA Yes? FRED ... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of -- LAVA (giving Fred a playful punch) You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties? FRED Well, gee, that's tough one -- (pause) -- Uh, what are my important duties? LAVA Publicity, Flintstone, publicity!

Fred's jaw drops as he sees -- \nFRED R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands. \nLEACH 'Ello,  Fred. I've 'eard a lot h'about  you from Mister Lava. H'at's  why we're going to put you on our  program. FRED M-me?   On -- on television? LAVA (patting his back, sotto) Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney.

LEACH Frederick, of course, is the man behind Fibrerock -- the invention that some predict will revolutionize life in the future. Frederick, 'ow does it feel to know that you 'ave personally brought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end? FRED (very affected accent) Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock... \n189   WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY                                      189 react with hopeful expressions -- \nBARNEY (sotto, to them) See?

I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction... 191   WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY                                         191 \nBarney's face falls.

(Sphere and needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.) A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out. It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn hasn't fallen far from the tree. POINDEXTER Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you promise I can cut in all the lines? LAVA Of course, Poindexter, of course. They head for the mastodon    and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown    and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. (Piltdown     is carrying a vaguely-familiar satchel). Lava gives them     a big look. They nod.

Fred? Fred? (concerned) We have a serious problem with Betty and Barney. FRED (alarmed) You mean you can see their house -- ? WILMA (exasperated) I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count? FRED Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success... \nHe takes her hand, looks into her eyes.       For a moment, Wilma's face softens.

Underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro). \nFASHION PARROT Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed... by Fibre furs... Fibre frocks...

FRED & BARNEY 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High!' \nThey break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around. FRED Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it. \n213   NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO                                  213 The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like \"mascot\" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted head under his arm. \nBARNEY Yeah.   Too bad we never made the team. FRED So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes? \nBARNEY You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they are. FRED (rummaging in it) Boy.    Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old \"uniform,\" but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries... \nReact, furious, jump out of their seats. BETTY A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his -- WILMA Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be! MRS. SLATE Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore! \nThe kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK, and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one by one. \nMRS. SLATE (alarmed) Ah... Poindexter... that's enough ... Poindexter...? \nThe kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES. Then one of the tables collapses. \nPause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside. But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL SHATTERS.

It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now. \nQuickly, he runs toward it.

When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads. WILMA (pointing) Fred!   There's a fire hose -- ! \nIndeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. Helpless, they step back. \nWith a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet. \nPause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of -- 258   GRACE                                                         258 -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies. 259   BETTY                                                         259 \nIn the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display. \nBAM-BAM D-dad, are we gonna be okay? BARNEY (pause; false smile) Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred? FRED Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh -- (CONTINUED) \n259   CONTINUED:                                                     259 He's started yelping because he's realized his arm    is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin    beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then    Fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with    a small flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas    stage magician. \nFRED -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all -- \nWith his other \"claw\" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out. BARNEY It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten. \nBarney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place. BARNEY (rapping on the head) -- Okay? FRED Hist hust fine! He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS -- \n260   IN THE BOX                                                     260 A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,     SNORING. (Note to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to emote with. Right now the snoring head      is in those little paws.) \nThe Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, \"sniffs\" the smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say \"one moment.\" Then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly. \nWe hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away... \n(CONTINUED) \n270   CONTINUED:                                                 270 WILMA Oh, Fred -- that's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard!

When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone.

Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge. HEADMISTRESS (as applause dies) Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An' sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze mos' fantas'tic recital in Bedrock 'istoree. Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother. \nHEADMISTRESS -- An' now, what better introduction could we 'ave for Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran' nephew... Poindexter Lava! She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter. He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins to play: POINDEXTER (singing loudly) 'Dino of Spain, I adore you Right from the moment I saw you -- ' \n218   QUICK SHOTS - AUDIENCE                                       218 Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their ears.) In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides his head under his paws. \nOn the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls. 219   CLOSE ON LAVA                                                219 \nHe surreptitiously checks his wrist watch... CUT TO: \n220   INT. EMPTY FIBRERIDE - TIGHT ON ANOTHER WATCH - NIGHT        220 \nThis one a pocket job. (Like Lava's, it's really a little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to provide a shadow!) We WIDEN, and see that this watch is held in a green, scaley claw. 221   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                221 \nIt's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the   exhibits! Now, the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights   up a cigar. Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big   toolbox and tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the   Fibre ride. \nCUT TO: 222   INT. FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                 222 Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel. FRED What'll we do when we get there? \nBARNEY We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. (holds up the flit gun) Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops! \nHe's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid \"clink.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n222   CONTINUED:                                                     222 FRED Barney -- ! (swerving all over the road) -- I can't see straight -- \nBarney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one hand and the monster head with the other. BARNEY Hang on, hang on -- \nOops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other. \n223   EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                               223 It careens around even more wildly now.      There's several near collisions. CUT TO: 224   EXT. \"ROCKDONALD'S\" RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         224 \"Rockdonald's\" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads \"OVER 100 SOLD.\") FELDSPAR (mouth full, bitching) Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate... Dirty Harock... Magma, P.I. And you know why? 'Cause they got the breaks, that's why! \nSuddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window at -- 225   FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST                                 225 \nboth still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.) \n226   BACK TO SCENE                                              226 GRAVEL S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy -- ! FELDSPAR There's a lesson there, Gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. Besides -- (realizing) -- Did you say 'creature'? \n", "test3_true": "Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone. FELDSPAR This is a xenosaurus alert. Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit of the Venturock Freeway! It is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male Caucasian. Car twelve is in hot pursuit. He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look. \nFELDSPAR (remembering) Oh, yeay... over and out! \nThe bird nods, appeased, flies off. DISPATCH PARAKEET (as it goes) Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way. Car Twelve is on the way... \nFELDSPAR (thrilled) Gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us! (trotting up to speed) Load the shotgun and turn on the siren! \n227   FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                    227 Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks. Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car. Fred drives with one hand, \"raps\" the monster head. It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync. \nFRED (muffled, shouting) Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore! Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to an approaching SIREN. They both look back at -- \n228   FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR                                      228 Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth CAT and is \"cranking\" its tail. As it WAILS away, the cops close in on our heroes. 229   BACK TO SCENE                                             229 \nFRED Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah! (turning to Barney) Haybee whee hould shtop -- ? \nBARNEY What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late! FRED 'Hen yore height, yore height... Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn. CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI. \n230   SLATE CITY - REAR GATE                                    230 A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and Slate Needle. We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading \"SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE.\" The fence collapses all around the car. \n231   NEW ANGLE                                                     231 Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact. BARNEY (hearing a siren) We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- ! \nFRED 'Ood hidea.   Ood whuk, ol' bhudee. They slap hands together like basketball players, then head off in two directions. \nCUT TO: 232   INT. SLATE NEEDLE                                         232 CAMERA PANS the audience as the accordion recital con- tinues. Several people look visibly ill. Finally, CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he slides forward on his knees. There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by Lava and the Slates. \nHEADMISTRESS Sank you, sank you. Our nex' performance is Bam-Bam, Pebbles... (checking notes) ... an' friend. She steps aside as a spotlight picks out -- \n233   PEBBLES, BAM-BAM & DINO                                   233 poised in the stances we recognize as the \"first positions\" of the \"Dino Dance.\" However, whereas the previous version of this was done impromptu and a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the dance is completely choreographed. \nKIDS You can keep the twist, the frug and hop -- \n234   VARIOUS ANGLES                                            234 As the Dino dance begins, FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT. The audience seems to really like it -- all except -- \n235   MRS. SLATE                                                    235 who glances over at the judges long enough to see that they like this a lot better than the accordion act. Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The MUSIC DIES. HEADMISTRESS Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ? \nMRS. SLATE I'll tell you what's wrong! This 'act' is an absolute disgrace! This is supposed to be a talent show!  And a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus! \n236   WILMA AND BETTY                                           236 \n"}

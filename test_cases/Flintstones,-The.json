There's something wrong with your lunch -- \nFRED (\"weighing it\") Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty.

FRED So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes? \nBARNEY You know Betty. She never throws anything away.

Fred also starts to get into his old \"uniform,\" but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem.

I'm just really busy. \nPETER You're watching Hell's Kitchen. That's not even B-list reality TV. \nCARL So I don't want to go out tonight. Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow. You don't know. \nPETER It's bigger than that. You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone. \nCARL What? So? I'm like a sexual camel. I only need it once every couple years. \nPETER I don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward. It's like you're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes. \nCARL You wear a Rolex? \nPETER Thanks for noticing. It's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster. Sapphire crystal, self-winding. Four Gs. But that's not the point I'm trying to make. \nCARL So I don't have an oyster watch. All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel. \nPETER What's wrong with Crate and Barrel? They have adorable stuff at reasonable prices. \nCARL Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm just getting more mature. I don't need the lifestyle ever night. \nPETER Lifestyle? You have to have a life to have a style of life. You never leave your apartment. You never meet anyone new. \nCARL I hate meeting people. \nPETER You've become a complete cave dweller. \nCARL I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band. That's not very cave dweller of me. \nPETER Just the other day?   That was seven years ago. \nCARL But that's not possible -- I was already working at the bank by then. \nPETER You had started there three years earlier. Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. You had so much potential. You shouldn't be a teller. You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do. \nCARL (SHOCKED) I've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years? How the hell did that happen? (doing the math) Ten years... if I had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now. \nPETER Actually, he'd be in fourth grade. \nCARL (starting to panic) I was making out with chicks by fourth grade. I was a little man by fourth grade. (THEN) Whatever. I don't need this shit right now. I'm an adult man. I can live my life as I see fit. Can you please leave? \nCarl pushes Peter out the door. Carl sits down on the couch. He then unballs the \"Just Say Yes\" pamphlet. It features an Indian man smiling beatifically. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM \nA banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian man smiling beatifically. We PAN DOWN to find Carl among the crowd. Carl sits down next to a WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN. \nWIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Is this your first time at one of Sanji's lectures? \nCARL (SCOFFING) Uh, yeah. (THEN) Have you been to this before? \nWIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Only like fifty-eight times. Sanji's a genius. Like seriously... he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room. He's like a mind grenade. \nCARL I don't know if I want that. \nWIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Oh you do not. But you need it. And that's why you are here. \nCARL Cool. Do you want anything from the refreshment area? \nWIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN You kidding? That processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to Chernobyl. \nCarl heads over to the refreshment table. Once he's out of her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room. Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers. People begin to sit. Carl sits down in the back. \nSANJI (V.O.) Life.   We are all living it. \nCarl laughs.   No one else does.   The lights get rosier. \nSANJI (V.O.) (cont'd) Or are we? Change doesn't start on the surface. It's generated from consciousness. But where is consciousness generated from? \nCarl looks around.   Everyone is nodding along with it. \nSANJI (cont'd) From the external. And the external is manipulated through our choices. And our choices start with one word. \nThe music ABRUPTLY SWITCHES to the opening beats of \"Jump\" by the Pointer Sisters. The rosy colored lights FLIP TO BRIGHT WHITE and SWEEP ACROSS THE CONVENTION CENTER ROOM. It is suddenly like a rock concert. SANJI (50s) BUSTS THROUGH THE GIANT BANNER. The whole crowd starts CHEERING. \nSANJI (cont'd) Yes! \nInstead of \"Jump\", Sanji's yelling \"Yes!\" \nSANJI (cont'd) Say yes! For your life! Yes! Change starts now! Yes! Yes! Yes! Say it with me! SAY YES! \nSanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks GO OFF. The crowd JUMPS ON THEIR FEET. \nSANJI (cont'd) Are you ready to open the door to yes? \nCROWD Yes! \nSANJI I am sorry, my friends.      But I cannot hear you? \nCARL Oh, thanks for the invite, but... \nFLASH OF SANJI LOOMING LARGE IN CARL'S EYES. \nSANJI Will you do it for me Carl?       Just for a day? \nBACK TO CARL AND PETER.       We CLOSE IN ON CARL'S MOUTH. \nCARL (in slo-mo) Yes. \nPETER Excuse me? \nCARL (clearly not wanting to) Yes. I will come to brunch. \nEXT. STACKERS - MORNING \nStackers is a cutesie brunch place.      Carl walks up to Peter, Lucy and Kath. \nKATH (AWKWARD) Morning, Carl. This is a surprise. \nCARL Why? \nKATH Because I've never seen you at brunch. Like ever. \nCARL You kidding? I love brunch. \nINT. STACKERS - LATER \nCarl, Peter, Lucy and Kath are still waiting with a big crowd of people to sit down for brunch. \nCARL Why do people wait an hour for breakfast? It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet. \nPETER If you don't want to be here, you don't have to be. \nCARL Of course I want to be here. I love waiting an hour for eggs. It's fun. Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier. \nPETER Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible. Two fifty but worth every penny. \nThe Waitress comes up. \nWAITRESS Lowell, party of five. \nA group of four people get up to be seated. \nCARL We were definitely before those Lowell people. \nKATH I hate when people jump ahead. \nCARL Why does no one ever say anything? \nPETER If you want to be sitting so bad, why don't you say something? \nCARL Yes.   I will. \nCarl walks up to the Waitress. \nCARL (cont'd) Excuse me, but we were here before those people. \nWAITRESS No you weren't. \nCARL Yes, we were. \nWAITRESS I have the list, dude.   The list doesn't lie. \nMeanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are looking away, trying not to get involved. \nCARL Well, this time the list lied. \nLUCY It's OK, Carl. It's just brunch. \nCARL (to the people who are being seated) You all know that we were up before you! And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch! \nPeter pulls Carl away from the Waitress. \nPETER What's going on with you? \nCARL I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order. \nOne of the customers who was being seated heads over. \nKATH Great. Now we're going to get into a fight. \nBRUNCH DUDE We talked about what you said... you're right. You guys were here before us. Sorry we didn't pipe up sooner. We cool, brother? \nCARL (SURPRISED) Yeah. We cool. \nCarl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug. \nINT. STACKERS - LATER \nCarl and his friends are sitting at a table.    Carl's slightly bored as his friends discuss real estate. \nLUCY It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views. It'd be perfect for you Kath. \nShe keeps grinding.    A pile of pepper's growing on his food. \nINT. STACKERS - LATER \nAll of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper. \nPETER I don't think I've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills. \nCARL I'm just addicted to the stuff. Chinese cultures say it's good for digestion. (THEN) You're all welcome to have some. \nLUCY That's... OK. Do you want a bite of mine? \nCARL (BEGRUDGINGLY) Yes. \nCarl takes a bite of Lucy's.      He then sips his coffee. \nCARL (cont'd) Uch. Brunch coffee. Why can't they make it black without all this frothy shit? \nPETER Because you ordered a latte. \nCarl's phone rings.   He answers it. \nNORMAN (O.S.) Hey, Carl. We're a little short on our Saturday staff. I know this is going against ten years of precedent, but you have any interest in coming in today? \nCARL I don't think... there's any reason why I shouldn't? On a Saturday there's nothing I like more than the inside of a bank. \nNORMAN (O.S.) There really is something magical about this place. \nINT. DUNKIN DONUTS \nCarl walks into Dunkin Donuts. \nDUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring? \nBeat. \nCARL Yes. \nDUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet? \nCARL All of them please. \nThe confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee. \nDUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER We're having a special on Munchkins? \nEXT. STREET \nCarl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee, the cute girl who hands out band fliers. \nRENEE Want a flier? Oh, it's you.    Never mind. \nCARL Of course I'll take a flier. \nCarl takes a flier.   Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier. \nCARL (cont'd) (READING) The Flying Buttresses. \nRENEE I knew after a year and a half of wearing you down, you'd give in. I'm Renee by the way. \nRenee holds out her hand. \nCARL Carl. \nRENEE Carl. Cool. I like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances. It gives it a nice intimate touch. See you soon Carl. \nCarl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation. He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK \nCarl STUMBLES INTO work, hyper from the giant coffee. \nNORMAN Morning, Carl. Thanks for coming in and being part of the Saturday banking experience. Oooh, Munchkins. Are those for the office, you dirty devil? \nCARL Yeah. I just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up. \nNORMAN (deadly serious) You didn't approve this with petty cash. \nCARL I spent my own money on them... \nNORMAN Kidding! Munchkins are always approved. Although, I can't reimburse you. (over the intercom) Today is free Munchkin day. That's right! Free Munchkin day! \nInstantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers. \nBANK EMPLOYEES Carl rules./You're the best./Finally I have a reason to live today. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK LOUNGE \nCarl's greeting.   A MIDDLE-AGED MOTHERLY CUSTOMER comes in. \nCARL How may I help you? \nBANK CUSTOMER I need to speak to a loan specialist. \nINT. NORMAN'S OFFICE \nCarl nervously sits before Norman. \nNORMAN Earlier today, you showed some initiative. And I loved it. What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk? \nCARL That seems like a lot of responsibility. \nNORMAN We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter. Besides, you'd have a starting salary of 52. \nCARL Grand? \nNORMAN No, dollars. What is this Darfur? (waving to an African- American employee) Sorry, Patricia, that was inappropriate. (then, back to Carl) Of course grand. To celebrate, next Saturday, I'm throwing a party. Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes. (WHISPERING) Save the cheerleader, save the world. \nCARL Next Saturday... sounds great. \nNORMAN Don't dress as Hiro.    I got dibs. \nCARL Wouldn't think of it. \nCarl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion. \nINT. RUDY'S \nCarl walks in the door. Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him. \nROONEY Carl Kendall? Out in the world? Are you some kind of ghost? Am I having a religious vision? \nCARL Believe it. Because this guy just got a promotion. \nLUCY Congrats, Carl! \nROONEY Well let's get you a beer. You want a 20 ouncer? I'm just joking - \nCARL Yes. \nRooney looks at Peter and Lucy. \nPETER A normal-sized beer is fine with me. \nLUCY I think I'm done actually. \nROONEY Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little beer, barkeep. \nBARTENDER Please don't call me that.   We're not in the middle ages. \nROONEY (to Carl) I can't believe you're out here. I'm giddy. I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year. You have any interest in pounding this shit? \nCARL Why not? \nRooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer. Carl reluctantly pounds it as well. Rooney slams his on the table. Carl puts it on the table. \nROONEY What do you say we have another? \nCARL Yes. \nROONEY You are a beast! \nLUCY Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run. \nCarl's a little drunk now. \nCARL Have a good day yuppifying your lives. \nPETER We need a sofa, Carl.     We're not buying a second home. \nROONEY Whatever, yuppy sellouts. \nLUCY It was good seeing you.    You should come out more often. \nCARL (kind of pleading) Please don't leave me here with him. \nPeter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious. They leave. \nINT. RUDY'S - NIGHT \nCarl and Rooney are really drunk. \nCARL I have not been this drunk in years! The room is spinning in a bad way! \nROONEY Barkeep! Two more double pints s'il vous plait! \nBARTENDER That was the last `barkeep.'   I am cutting you off. \nROONEY Well fortunately you're not the only game in town! Let's go to some place with class. \nINT. SENOR FROG'S - NIGHT \nRooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs. \nCARL Where's the class? \nROONEY They wear uniforms here. \nCARL You do not cross Carl Kendall. \nThe Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's. \nHOT GIRL Hey. I'm sorry about Domingo. He likes to think he's my boyfriend but he's not. You're cute. \nThe Hot Girl KISSES Carl. \nHOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Want to go some place private? \nCARL Yes. \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nLight is streaming in through the window. Carl opens his eyes. He's in bad shape. He looks over to see the Hot Girl finishing getting dressed. \nHOT GIRL My fiance called. He was like really sorry about last night.      I have to go. \nCARL Your fiance? \nHOT GIRL Domingo. The guy who punched you in the face. \nCARL I thought you said you two weren't even dating? \nHOT GIRL We were broken up last night.      It was fun hanging out. \nThe Hot Girl kisses Carl on the forehead. \nHOT GIRL (cont'd) I made some coffee. It's in the kitchen. Sorry for leading you on. \nThe Hot Girl LEAVES.    Carl smiles.    That was awesome. \nINT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM \nCarl runs to the conference room.      The Just Say Yes seminar has been packed up. \nINT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY \nCarl walks up to the counter. \nCARL Hi... is there a Sanji Gupta staying here? \nRECEPTIONIST Room 125. \nINT. HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY \nCarl walks down the hallway. He knocks on Room 125. After a couple minutes of shuffling around, Sanji opens the door. \nCARL I'm Carl.    The guy from yesterday. \nSANJI Of course, of course!      Please come in! \nCarl comes into Sanji's hotel room. \nSANJI (cont'd) Would you like a cup of coffee? \nCARL No thanks. I just wanted to thank you for that inspiration. \nSANJI Fantastic. So how do you plan on continuing with your journey? \nCARL You know, just living every day to it's fullest. And, like, learning to continue to experience life or whatever. \nSANJI Outstanding, Carl. Except for one THING: (suddenly intense) You are completely bullshitting me! \nCARL I just said I'm going to keep experiencing life. I thought you'd be happy. \nSANJI You're like a cigarette addict, Carl. Except you're addicted to boredom. On the way in here, Carl, I offered you a coffee and you refused. Perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had. Who's to say? Not you, Carl, because you said no! Anyone can quit smoking for a day. But for a lifetime? No. \nCARL So what should I do? \nSanji PULLS OUT a contract. \nSANJI Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto. \nCarl takes the Maniyesto. \nCARL (reading the document) 1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say yes. 2) The yes cannot distort the truth. \nSANJI (EXPLAINING) You cannot say \"Yes, the world is flat\" because that is an untruth. \nCARL (reading the document) 3) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow. (to Sanji) Who should that be? \nSANJI A close friend who will not tell a soul. \nCARL (reading the document) 5) I hereby void the \"do you want\" loophole. (to Sanji) What is that? \nSANJI If someone asks you \"do you want to go to the art museum\" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go. And finally, a warning. (SPOOKILY) If you say `no', even once, even for a cup of coffee, be prepared to lose every single little thing you've gained. (THEN) So what do you say, Carl? (WHISPERING) What do you say? \nCARL I say... yes. \nCarl signs the Maniyesto. \nSANJI And here. \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nCarl wakes up.   He looks at the tattooed \"Yes\" on his hand. \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT \nCarl goes through a series of junk mail flyers for credit cards. He VERY CAREFULLY fills each one of them out. \nINT. DUNKIN DONUTS \nCarl walks into Dunkin Donuts.    Before the cashier can say anything... \nCARL Black coffee, large. \nDUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like... \nCARL (cutting her off) To have a wonderful day?    I would. \nCarl turns to see a giant poster with the words \"DO YOU WANT A MOCHA CARAMEL COOLATA?\" Carl turns back to the cashier. \nCARL (cont'd) (RESIGNED) And could I also have a Mocha Caramel Coolata. \nDUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER With whipped cream? \nEXT. STREET \nCarl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee drink and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee and wordlessly takes a flier. \nRENEE Hey, give that back.    You already took one. \nCARL What's the hurt in taking another? \nRENEE Destroys the Earth. Also, they cost me ten cents a copy. Besides, are you even going to come? \nCARL Of course.     I couldn't say `no.' \nAs he walks away... \nCARL (cont'd) Even if I wanted to. \nRENEE See you tonight, Carl! \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK \nCarl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email. In the background, we see various SUPER HAPPY EMPLOYEES eating the Dunkin Donuts that Carl has brought. We see on the screen another email from the King of Nigeria. \nCARL Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I would love to help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction. Please let me know what I can do. Yours, Carl Kendall. \nHe checks the next email. \nCARL (cont'd) Would I like Viagra? Yes, I would. \nCarl writes back to the Viagra. ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: The next email is from PERSIANWIFEFINDER.COM. \nCARL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Do I want a Persian wife? Perhaps I do. \nCarl clicks onto the Persianwifefinder.com and starts uploading his profile. Norman walks by. \nCARL (cont'd) Norman, would you say I prefer Iranian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or no preference? \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK \nCarl's reading his email when a HIGH SCHOOL GIRL sits down. \nHIGH SCHOOL GIRL You Carl Kendall? \nCARL Yeah. \nHIGH SCHOOL GIRL I hear that you do small loans. \nCARL Where did you hear that? \nHIGH SCHOOL GIRL Marge. The lady my mom buys her beanie babies from. \nCARL I told her not to say anything. \nHIGH SCHOOL GIRL I only need five hundred bucks. I'm starting college next year and I need it for books. I can't afford them now but I can pay them off over the course of the year. \nCarl looks to make sure Norman's not around then he stamps her form. \nHIGH SCHOOL GIRL (cont'd) Thank you so much, Mr. Kendall. \nEXT. STREET \nCarl walks down the street, taking fliers from anyone who passes them out. We do QUICK CUTS of him with various people as he walks down the street. \nCARL I might have some stuff to pawn./I will definitely check out your gun selection./I would like to learn Korean. \nBERLITZ FLIER GUY If you're interested, intro to Korean is starting right now. \nINT. BERLITZ CLASS - DAY \nCarl's sitting in a Korean class with several businessmen. \nKATH Maybe next week. There's someone you should probably meet. Carl, this is Seb. \nA very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl. \nCARL Seb?    What is that?   Swedish? \nSEB Yes. \nBeat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.   Carl notices this and is not particularly happy. \nSEB (cont'd) I've heard a lot about you, Carl. \nSeb's phone rings. \nSEB (cont'd) Sorry, sweetie. I've got to take this. \nSeb walks off and answers his cell. \nCARL You're on a date then? \nKATH Yeah.   Met him at my firm. \nCARL He's very tall. \nKATH I guess so, yeah. \nSeb returns. \nCARL Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb. So I'll be going. \nCarl starts to walk off. \nSEB Unless... you'd like to join us? \nCarl stops in his tracks. He mouths the word \"fuck.\" Carl turns. Kath nods at Carl as in, \"You don't have to join us.\" \nSEB (cont'd) It was good meeting you -- \nCARL I'd love to. Join you guys. \nKATH What? \nINT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - LATER \nSeb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner. It is incredibly awkward. Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off. \nCARL So, how did you guys meet? \nKATH I told you. Through the firm. \nA waiter arrives. \nWAITER Would you like to order some wine? \nKATH/CARL/SEB Yes. \nCUT TO LATER -- Carl, Kath and Seb are now slightly drunk. However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk. They are still sitting in silence. Seb turns to Kath and starts saying something quietly to her. \nCARL Oh, this is good. (CHUCKLING) I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second I was sure the sign said \"Pizza Hat.\" And then I thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas? (beat, weakly) You know. Because it sounds like \"Pizza Hut\" only it's a hat shop. \nSEB Look, Carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off? \nCarl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant. As he leaves, he smiles to himself. His phone rings. He sees it's Rooney on the Caller ID. \nCARL Shit. \nCarl answers the phone. \nROONEY (O.S.) What's up Carl? It's Rooney!      What do you say we grab a couple brewskis? \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nCarl flips on his computer. He's trashed.     He has a bunch of emails. He clicks on the email. \nNIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear   brother Carl, Thank you for your   last note you sent me. But we must   move quickly. I must have your   bank details right now. Send them   to me. Your Associate, Omar, King   of Nigeria \nCARL (while typing) Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order. Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut? Then I will happily send you my bank details. Sincerely, Carl. \nCarl then flips on persianwifefinder.com.    A PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE comes onto the screen. \nPERSIAN CARTOON GENIE Sa'laam, Carl. You have sixty-five winks. Allah Akbar. \nThe screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women. \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN \nCarl's alarm goes off. Carl hits it and sits up. He grabs his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up. \nEXT. PARK - PRE-DAWN \nRenee, along with several other amateur photographers in sweat suits, have gathered. They all have big cameras around their necks. Carl walks up to them. He does not look good. \nCARL Good morning. \nCARL How about a calendar shower? \nLUCY Can we concentrate at the task at hand? \nCARL Do you even know what a calendar shower is? Maybe a calendar shower is awesome. \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month. \nLUCY That's kind of cute. \nCARL I think that's really cute. \nCarl's starting to get really into it. He turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled \"Knights in White Armor.\" \nCARL (cont'd) Look at this one -- \"Knights in White Armor.\" \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion. \nCARL You have got to do that.   Like it's not even a choice. \nLUCY That seems a little extreme. \nCARL You only get married once. \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS Your friend happens to be right. \nLUCY You're really good at this. You mind helping me with the wedding invitations? \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK \nCarl's sitting across from an Arab Guy at the loan desk. \nARAB GUY I love cell phones. I breathe cell phones. I own, myself, thirty-five cell phones. My brother is an idiot and he's selling cell phones hand over fist. What do you have? A Nokia 9850? \nThe Arab Guy goes to grab Carl's phone.   He sees the photo of Renee on the phone's wallpaper. \nARAB GUY (cont'd) Oooh, pretty lady. \nCarl grabs his phone back. \nCARL How much do you need? \nARAB GUY Eighty five hundred. \nCARL Done. \nCarl stamps his form. \nCUT TO A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL SITTING WITH HER SILENT MOM: \nTEN YEAR OLD GIRL I was with my sister? And we had this lemonade stand? And we sold like a hundred cups of lemonade in two days? And so I want to expand? (MORE) \nTEN YEAR OLD GIRL (cont'd) All I need is three thousand dollars? \nCarl stamps her form. \nCUT TO A JITTERY GUY. \nJITTERY GUY Just give me the cash. \nCARL You promise you'll pay it back? \nJITTERY GUY Basically. \nCarl stamps his form.    Norman comes over. \nNORMAN May I speak to you, Carl? \nINT. NORMAN'S OFFICE \nNorman sits across from Carl. \nNORMAN I know what you're doing. \nCARL What am I doing? \nNORMAN You're loaning below our minimum. \nCarl doesn't know what to say. \nNORMAN (cont'd) You thought I wouldn't notice the paperwork? I'm not the regional manager because I ignore the details. \nCARL I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand. A bank's job is not to just help the rich. It's to help anyone with a dream achieve it. \nNORMAN I know. These microloans are pretty interesting. So I'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank. \nCARL Thank you so much. \nNORMAN If corporate finds out, you're the one who's getting fired. So keep it quiet. \nCarl mimes zipping up his mouth and throwing away the key. \nQUICK CUTS OF CARL STAMPING LOTS OF FORMS \n-- CUT TO Carl with a bunch of kids. All the kids are folding brand new dollar bills into paper airplanes \n-- CUT TO Carl walking down the street, a big smile on his face, taking everyone's fliers as per usual. He walks past a CULTY GUY named TONY who's passing out books. \nTONY Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism? \nCarl takes one of the books. \nTONY (cont'd) Would you like to have tea and discuss? \nCARL I'm kind of in a rush... \nTONY My place is right around the corner. \nINT. TONY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCarl's sitting awkwardly on the floor across from Tony.   They are both drinking tea. \nTONY It is only through the four noble truths and the destruction of desire that we can end suffering. \nCARL Well, that's really neat. (awkward beat) So, thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go -- \nTONY Do you like Dionne Warwick? \nTony flips on Dionne Warwick's \"I Say a Little Prayer.\" \nTONY (cont'd) Now she had style. \nCARL It was really great meeting you -- \nTONY C'mon, Carl. Shake your groove thang. \nTony pulls Carl up.    Carl starts to awkwardly shake his groove thing. \nTONY (cont'd) I like big guys. \nCARL I really have to go. \nTony grabs Carl and kisses him full on the lips. \nTONY Want to go into my bedroom? \nCLOSE IN on Carl's face.      He looks down on the \"Yes\" that's on his palm. \nCARL (very quiet) Yes. \nCarl and Tony head into his bedroom. \nINT. TONY'S BEDROOM \nCARL Do you have any candles?      I just love candles. \nTONY Sure. \nTony instantly pulls out candles and lights them. \nCARL How about wine?       Like a bottle of Beaujolais? \nTONY I only have Beaujolais Nouveau. \nTony pulls out a bottle of wine and two glasses.     Tony goes in to kiss Carl. \nCARL I have herpes. \nTONY Upstairs or downstairs? \nCARL Downstairs? \nTONY Front door or back door? \nCARL It's a swinging door! \nTONY Just give it! \nTony pushes Carl down onto the bed. \nINT. PETER'S LAW OFFICE \nCarl's sitting across from Peter in Peter's fancy law office. They're each eating burgers. \nPETER What's with the kitten? \nPULL BACK to reveal a kitten on Peter's desk. \nCARL I just adopted her. If you're interested, they're giving them away in front of Petco. \nPETER I don't want a kitten. \nCARL Neither did I. \nPETER'S SECRETARY Andy Solomon on line two. \nPeter picks up the phone. \nCARL It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny. My boss Norman always throws theme parties. \nRENEE So if it's lame why do you work there? \nCARL Because... it's actually not lame. (REALIZING) I just gave the answer I've automatically given for years. I'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever. I started this pilot program that gives out microloans. \nRENEE What's that? \nCARL Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's kind of dorky. \nRENEE That actually sounds really cool. \nThe waitress comes over. \nRENEE (cont'd) I'm stuffed. But I would love to wrap this up. \nCARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [We are very fat. But can I please have this food made mobile?] \nRENEE So, what do you say we hit this crazy party? \nCARL Funny, not crazy.    My boss is white noise. \nRENEE White noise? \nCARL You know, like totally boring. \nRENEE I don't know anyone who's totally boring. Crack a person's shell -- there's always something creepy underneath. \nINT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNorman opens the door. He's dressed as the Japanese character Hiro from the show Heroes. \nNORMAN Carl! Welcome. Or should I say, uerukamu! \nRENEE What's going on? \nCARL I wouldn't bother. \nNORMAN You didn't tell her? This is a dress-up as your favorite character from Heroes. Do you watch? \nRENEE I currently don't have a television. \nNorman stares at her. \nNORMAN I don't know what to do with that information. There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes. I entreat you to make friends. Let's get this party started! \nINT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT \nIt's very quiet.    A couple people mill about. \nCARL We don't have to stay long. \nRENEE It's a party. Let's socialize. \nCarl and Renee walk up to a MOUSEY GIRL. \nCARL I'm Carl.     This is Renee. \nKHATOON Hey.     I'm Khatoon. \nIt's complete silence.    Beat. \nKHATOON (cont'd) Do I know you from somewhere? \nCARL I don't think so. \nKHATOON Are you listed on Persianwifefinder.com? \nRenee laughs.    Carl fake laughs with her. \nKHATOON (cont'd) Seriously, though, are you? \nCARL So, how do you know Norman? \nKHATOON Karate Club. \nNorman comes in with more chips.   There are now about ten times as many snacks as guests. \nNORMAN Baked Lays people!   It is on! \nCARL You're in a karate club? \nINT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT \nEveryone's standing around Norman. They've laid several pieces of wood out over a coffee table. \nPARTY GUESTS Norman!    Norman! Norman! \nNorman KARATE CHOPS the wood in half.   The guests cheer. Norman takes a big bow. \nRENEE (whispering to Carl) Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell. \nRenee leaves Carl. \nThe room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes.   Renee starts to go through the boxes. \nCARL You don't need to do that. \nRENEE You have a lot of Mexican Viagra. \nCARL I have a congenital heart thing it helps. And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here. \nRENEE You better not be a criminal. Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would. \nCARL It's cheaper to buy in bulk.    Is that a crime? \nRENEE A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal. \nBeat. \nRENEE (cont'd) Well, are you going to make out with me or what? \nCARL Yes. \nCarl grabs Renee and starts making out with her.   They fall onto the bed. REVEAL Rooney watching them. \nROONEY You must be Renee. I have heard so much about you. Can I watch? \nCarl doesn't know what to say.   Before he has to say yes... \nRENEE No, you can't watch. \nINT. CARL'S BEDROOM - LATER \nRenee and Carl lie next to each other. \nRENEE You know what I would love?

He stops massaging. \nRENEE (cont'd) (while asleep) Please keep massaging, please? \nCarl starts massaging again, wincing while he does it. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK \nCarl's sitting across from a LARGE MAN. Carl's hands are like claws. A line of people waits to speak with him. \nCARL How much does a Schwinn cost? \nLARGE MAN Three hundred fifty three dollars. It'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground. I've tried on foot. I only have a two mile radius. \nCARL Done and done. \nCarl stamps the package.      Norman comes over to the loan desk. \nNORMAN Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak with you. \nCARL Really?   Because I have a thing at one... \nNORMAN He asked for you specifically. Ixnay on the small loans-ay. \nCarl looks over. He sees the President (from the beginning of the movie) sitting in the conference room. Carl gets nervous. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM \nCarl walks into the conference room.     The bank president, CHRIS PARKER, motions to a seat. \nCHRIS PARKER Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker. President of Southwest Bank. \nCARL I actually met you when I was just a teller. \nCHRIS PARKER (no recollection of it at ALL) Of course! (reading from a binder) Pet-a-Puppy day. Free cookie day. Free half hour on the bank's punching bag day. You've upped walk-in traffic by 35%. Not only that -- you've also taken charge of corporate day care. I like a team player. \nCarl's phone buzzes.    The caller ID says LUCY. \nCARL (cont'd) I'm sorry. \nLUCY You've been so good to me. I've really come to depend on you. I want to pay you back. \nCARL Not necessary. \nLUCY Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days. \nCARL For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me. \nLUCY If you want to look at some open houses, I'm happy to waive my fee. \nINT. LUXURIOUS APARTMENT - DAY \nCarl and Lucy walk into a luxurious apartment. Gourmet kitchen, floor to ceiling windows, giant media center. \nLUCY So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford. Are you interested? \nCarl hits a button.    A GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN DESCENDS. \nCARL Yes. \nLUCY Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place you've looked -- \nCARL Yes.    I've got to run. \nLUCY I'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight. \nCARL What? \nLUCY We're all having dinner.    Tonight. Remember? \nCARL Right.   Of course. \nCarl runs out. \nINT. BLOOD BANK \nCarl giving blood while on the phone. \nCARL (on the phone) I just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard. \nHe checks his watch.

It's only the very first time I've met your friends. \nCARL It was work, it went crazy late. \nCarl takes a breath.    He's about to pass out. \nRENEE What's with the \"They're Out There\" and \"I Gave\" button? \nREVEAL Carl's sporting buttons that say \"They're Out There\" and \"I Gave.\" \nCARL Long story.

As per usual, Carl has several different meals in front of him. He also has a martini, a glass of water, and a glass of orange juice. Carl's showing off to his friends. As he shows off, Renee looks irritated. \nCARL (showing off, to Peter) Your wife found me a really great place. Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with jacuzzi. \nLUCY Least I could do. At least he's involved with our wedding. \nPETER (ignoring Lucy's tone) I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss? \nCARL Oh, this old thing?   Prada, I think. \nRENEE You think? We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit. \nLUCY What do yo do for a living, Renee? \nCARL She's terrified too. \nPETER Really? \nCARL Of course she is. I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together. \nPETER But what if I really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream? Does that make me a bad husband? \nCARL What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference. \nThe girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on. There's a silent beat. \nGIRLS (high pitched goodbyes) It was wonderful meeting you!/I loved it!/Let me know when you throw your next art thing! \nEveryone gets into their cars.

I don't know which yes to take. \nSANJI How well off? \nCARL I don't know why that's important. \nSANJI I should know all the data. \nCARL A lot, OK? \nSANJI This is    what I recommend. Every winter,    I throw a two week long seminar    in Aspen. It's only ten grand a    week and it will open your mind up    -- \nCARL I don't want to go to a seminar. I just need help with this question. \nSANJI For you, eight grand a week. I have helped celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch. You will love it -- \nCARL (REALIZING) You're a total con artist. \nSANJI I am not a con artist.

Your good friend, Omar, Former King of Nigeria. \nCarl starts typing fast. As Carl writes the following email, we cuts of him THROWING AWAY THE BOXES OF STUFF HE BOUGHT OVER THE INTERNET and GIVING AWAY THE SIX KITTENS HE GOT TO THE ASPCA. \nCARL (V.O.)

You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the World Bank. \nCARL So I discovered b-school's not for me.

You don't even care that I'm breaking up with you. \nCARL Of course I care.   But I also understand. \nKATH You shouldn't just understand. You should be mad. Or upset. Or sad. Or something. \nCARL We're at different places in our lives. I get it. \nKATH Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year's Eve and all you can say is \"I get it?\" It is completely within your right to call me a bitch. \nCARL That would be inappropriate. \nKATH (tearing up) I can't believe I've been dating someone so emotionless. \nCARL C'mere.

(THEN) (MORE) \nNORMAN (cont'd) So, Carl, I'm having a party this Friday. It's a funny hat party. May I entreat you to come? \nCarl looks at his calendar.   It's totally empty. \nCARL (clearly lying) I'm out of town. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOBBY \nCarl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the middle distance. A CUSTOMER approaches him. \nBANK CUSTOMER Hey, I need to speak to a loan specialist and there's no one on the floor. \nCARL Sorry. Today I'm officially a greeter. \nBeat. \nBANK CUSTOMER But there's no one around. \nCARL Someone might come. And if I'm not here, they won't be greeted. \nBANK CUSTOMER You're really not going to help me? \nCARL Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied. \nThe Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as Carl stands in the middle of the floor. It is very awkward. No one comes in. Carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customer's view of him. \nNow that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank. Through the floor to ceiling windows, he sees the handsome NEW PRESIDENT OF SOUTHWEST BANK, CHRIS PARKER, tear up in a Mercedes. He steps out of the Mercedes with a hot girl on his arm. He and the girl walk into the bank. Carl stares at them, jealously. \nCHRIS PARKER Hey, there. I'm Chris Parker. The new president of Southwest Bank. Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager. \nNORMAN That would be me.   Norman Calhoun. \nChris turns to Carl. \nCARL I'm Carl Kendall.   Just a teller. \nCHRIS PARKER I was \"just a teller.\" And now I'm \"just president of the largest bank in the Southwest.\" (to Norman) You need anything, you let corporate know. You hear? \nNORMAN Definitely. \nChris Parker and his HOT SECRETARY leaves.     Carl watches them, clearly jealous. \nNORMAN (cont'd) Nice work if you can get it.   Am I right? \nCARL (clearly jealous) Yeah, if you're into fake breasts and German engineering. \nNORMAN Check and check. \nThe Bank Customer comes around. \nBANK CUSTOMER Can you help me now? \nCARL No, but this gentleman can. \nCarl indicates Norman.   Norman goes to help the customer. \nINT. SOUTHWEST BANK \nCarl stares up at the clock.   The clock finally CLICKS TO 5:00PM. \nNORMAN Think about my party, Carl! \nCARL Will do! \nINT.

Renee's taking photos as they BUMP OVER THE FIELD. \nCARL THIS IS AWESOME! \nTRACTOR DRIVER WANT ME TO OPEN THIS SUCKER UP? \nCARL/RENEE YES! \nThe driver TURNS UP THE SPEED.   They're suddenly going crazy fast. \nTRACTOR DRIVER TAKE THE WHEEL! FEEL THE POWER OF JOHN DEERE! \nCarl takes the wheel. The tractor IMMEDIATELY GETS AWAY FROM HIM. They SWERVE STRAIGHT and CRASH THROUGH THE WALL OF AN OLD BARN. The DRIVER kills the engine. Renee, Carl and the Driver catch their breath. \nCARL There's, uhh, no power steering. \nTRACTOR DRIVER It's a tractor, not a Toyota. \nCARL I'm sorry about the barn. \nTRACTOR DRIVER Been meaning to tear this sucker down anyway. \nEXT. ANTELOPE PARK AND SUNKEN GARDENS \nCarl and Renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park. \nRENEE I think I might have whiplash from that tractor ride. \nCARL Just don't sue me. \nRENEE Watch your back, Carl.   I mean it. I'm very litigious. \nCARL This day has been so randomly incredible. \nRENEE Would you... want to... travel around the world with me? (THEN) I mean, I know we haven't really been seeing each other for that long, but I don't know... \nCARL Yes. \nRENEE Yes? \nCARL Definitely. \nRENEE I think I'm falling, you know... Are you... ? \nCARL Yes. \nThey kiss. \nRENEE Before our flight, what do you say we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks? \nCARL I'm definitely falling for you. \nINT. LINCOLN AIRPORT \nCarl's sitting in the lounge at the Lincoln Airport.    An OLD WOMAN comes up to him. \nOLD WOMAN Excuse me. Would you mind bringing this to my son? \nThe Old Woman hands Carl an UNMARKED, SHADY-LOOKING PACKAGE. \nCARL Like you want me to bring it with me? On the plane? \nOLD WOMAN Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today. \nCARL (very nervous) Yeah. Sure. I'd be happy to. \nOLD WOMAN He's a tall, blond fellow named Sheldon Winkleton. He'll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it. You are a dear. \nThe Old Woman shuffles off.    Carl looks at the box.   Renee returns. \nRENEE I got US Weekly, Star and, for a little culture, the National Enquirer. \nCARL National Enquirer? \nRENEE They have movie reviews.    What's in the package? \nCARL Just a gift for some buddies back home. \n", "test2_true": "Carl walks through security. He puts the package on the conveyor belt. They don't notice anything odd. \nINT. PLANE \nCarl and Renee sit next to each other on the plane. \nRENEE I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom. \nRenee heads to the bathroom. Carl takes the package out from under the seat in front of him. He starts to breathe really hard. He very gingerly opens the package. He pulls back the packing peanuts revealing... a box of homemade chocolates. Carl breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF. \nINT. AIRPORT \nCarl and Renee walk off the plane, Carl carrying the package under his arm. Carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign that says \"SHELDON WINKLETON.\" He heads towards the guy but before he can several DEA AGENTS with ADORABLE, DRUG SNIFFING DOGS surround Carl. The dogs start BARKING LIKE MAD. \nDEA AGENT Put the package down!    Put it down! \nCarl looks up to see \"Sheldon\" WALKING SWIFTLY OUT THE SLIDING DOORS of the airport. \nDEA AGENT (cont'd) Get on the ground! Both of you! \nThe DEA AGENTS KICK the box open. Chocolates spill out over the ground. They crack open the chocolates to reveal TINY BAGGIES OF COCAINE. \nRENEE What the hell is that? \nCARL I don't know! \nAs Carl is dragged out by the cops, he passes Tony, standing near the exit, shaking his head. \nINT. JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM \nCarl's sitting across from two DEA Agents, Good Cop Bob and Bad Cop Bob. \nGOOD COP BOB I'm Bob. \nBAD COP BOB And I'm Bob. \nCarl can't help but laugh. \nBAD COP BOB (cont'd) Do you find that funny? \nCarl sees his hand with \"Yes\" on it. \nCARL Yes. I'm sorry. Just let the girl go. She doesn't know anything. \nBAD COP BOB We'll see about that, Carl. \nCARL Some old lady gave me a package in the Lincoln airport to deliver to her son, Sheldon Winkleton. That was really stupid of me and I realize that now. I don't know anything about anything. \nGOOD COP BOB Just answer a few questions and I'm sure we'll get this all sorted out. Have you ever used illegal drugs? \nCarl stares at them.    He should probably lie... \nCARL Yes. \nGOOD COP BOB Pot? \nCARL Yes.   But that's all. \nBAD COP BOB How about shrooms? \nCarl nods. \nCARL But that's the only bad shit I've done. I swear. \nBAD COP BOB Never cheated on a girlfriend? \nCARL (WEEPING) Yes, I have. But I was in high school. I was a mess. She had cheated on me -- \nThe Bad Cop SLAMS his fist down on the table. \nBAD COP BOB You disgust me. \nThe Good Cop restrains the Bad Cop. \nINT. JAIL - OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM \nThe two cops DISCUSS Carl. We see Carl freaking out through the one-way mirror behind them as they talk. \nGOOD COP BOB He's a moron. But I think he's telling the truth. \nBAD COP BOB I agree. No one ever admits to the cheating question. \nEXT. POLICE STATION \nCarl's sitting on the steps.    Renee comes out of the station. \nRENEE What the hell happened? \nCARL I can explain. \nRENEE So explain. Are you a drug smuggler? \n", "test2_id": 1600, "test3_input": "INT.

This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter. He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger. \nCARL You speak English? \nSEUNG KIM You think an international bank financier wouldn't speak fluent English? For whom do you work, traitor? Shanghai Bank? Chinatrust? \nCARL For myself. \nSEUNG KIM Fine. Keep it secret. Unfortunately, I cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up. Good day. \nSeung Kim walks out, followed by all his employees.   Before Chris can say anything... \nCARL I quit. \nCarl leaves. \nINT.

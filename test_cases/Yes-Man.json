{"test1_input": "KATH Maybe next week. There's someone you should probably meet. Carl, this is Seb. \nA very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl. \nCARL Seb?    What is that?   Swedish? \nSEB Yes. \nBeat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.   Carl notices this and is not particularly happy. \nSEB (cont'd) I've heard a lot about you, Carl. \nSeb's phone rings. \nSEB (cont'd) Sorry, sweetie. I've got to take this. \nSeb walks off and answers his cell. \nCARL You're on a date then? \nKATH Yeah.   Met him at my firm. \nCARL He's very tall. \nKATH I guess so, yeah. \nSeb returns. \nCARL Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb. So I'll be going. \nCarl starts to walk off. \nSEB Unless... you'd like to join us? \nCarl stops in his tracks. He mouths the word \"fuck.\" Carl turns. Kath nods at Carl as in, \"You don't have to join us.\" \nSEB (cont'd) It was good meeting you -- \nCARL I'd love to. Join you guys. \nKATH What? \nINT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - LATER \nSeb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner. It is incredibly awkward. Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off. \nCARL So, how did you guys meet? \nKATH I told you. Through the firm. \nA waiter arrives. \nWAITER Would you like to order some wine? \nKATH/CARL/SEB Yes. \nCUT TO LATER -- Carl, Kath and Seb are now slightly drunk. However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk. They are still sitting in silence. Seb turns to Kath and starts saying something quietly to her. \nCARL Oh, this is good. (CHUCKLING) I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day, and for a second I was sure the sign said \"Pizza Hat.\" And then I thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas? (beat, weakly) You know. Because it sounds like \"Pizza Hut\" only it's a hat shop. \nSEB Look, Carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off? \nCarl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant. As he leaves, he smiles to himself. His phone rings. He sees it's Rooney on the Caller ID. \nCARL Shit. \nCarl answers the phone. \nROONEY (O.S.) What's up Carl? It's Rooney!      What do you say we grab a couple brewskis? \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nCarl flips on his computer. He's trashed.     He has a bunch of emails. He clicks on the email. \nNIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear   brother Carl, Thank you for your   last note you sent me. But we must   move quickly. I must have your   bank details right now. Send them   to me. Your Associate, Omar, King   of Nigeria \nCARL (while typing) Dear Omar, While I appreciate the gravity of your situation, perhaps a goodwill branch is in order. Could you perhaps loan me a million and take it out of my final cut? Then I will happily send you my bank details. Sincerely, Carl. \nCarl then flips on persianwifefinder.com.    A PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE comes onto the screen. \nPERSIAN CARTOON GENIE Sa'laam, Carl. You have sixty-five winks. Allah Akbar. \nThe screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women. \nINT. CARL'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN \nCarl's alarm goes off. Carl hits it and sits up. He grabs his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up. \nEXT. PARK - PRE-DAWN \nRenee, along with several other amateur photographers in sweat suits, have gathered. They all have big cameras around their necks. Carl walks up to them. He does not look good. \nCARL Good morning. \n", "test1_true": "CARL Well, it is five in the morning. \nRENEE Mammals are meant to be up at dawn. It's how we're built biologically. Where's your camera? \nCarl realizes he forgot his camera. \nCARL I thought I'd use my phone. \nCarl pulls out his camera cell phone. \nRENEE Awesome idea. So light. \nCARL That's what I thought. \nRENEE Let's hit it. \nRenee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers start jogging. Carl can barely keep up with them. \nRENEE (cont'd) Oooh, pretty. \nAs she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it. \nEXT. LAKE - DAWN \nThe group reaches the lake as the sun rises. They all snap photos. Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera. He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her. She looks pretty in the photo. \nRENEE Alright!    Enough standing around! \nRenee starts jogging again. Carl starts after her and then abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground. Renee and the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him. \nINT. CAFE - MORNING \nCarl sits across from an Iranian women. \nIRANIAN WOMAN It was delightful meeting you, Carl. \nCARL As it was meeting you Farinoush. \nIRANIAN WOMAN Although I must say I was surprised to discover that you are in no way Persian. Nor are you six foot two. You should change that on your profile. \nCARL Will do.    Should I call you? \nIRANIAN WOMAN Sorry, I want a tall guy. \nThe Iranian Woman leaves, passing Lucy. \nLUCY Who was that? \nCARL Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I don't think we're right for each other. \nLUCY How'd you meet? \nCARL PersianWifeFinder.com. (ignoring her odd look) Let's talk wedding shower. \nLUCY So, I know it's just a wedding shower, so who cares really? And it's like so lame? But I've made an appointment at a stationery store. Are you going to totally kill me? \nCARL (dripping with sarcasm) You kidding? I love stationery. \nLucy gets up.   Carl follows her.   He does not look happy. \nINT. STATIONERY STORE - LATER \nLucy and Carl are looking over a book of stationery with the STATIONERY PROPRIETESS. Carl can't concentrate. \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS This one is nice. I especially love it in cream. \nLUCY Ooooh, pretty. What do you think? \nCARL Looks good to me. \nLUCY (sarcastic annoyance) Thanks for your opinion. \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS It's always difficult to get the husband-to-be's opinion. \nLUCY (derisive laughter) I'm not marrying him. \nCARL I'm just helping throw the shower. \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS Oh. What's the party going to be like? Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation. \nLUCY Nothing special. Just hors d'oeuvres and wine. \nCarl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations. \nCARL Look at this -- Bridal Bingo. What's Bridal Bingo? \nSTATIONERY PROPRIETESS It's bingo, except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins. \nCARL That sounds fun. \nLUCY I'm not doing Bridal Bingo. \n", "test1_id": 1599, "test2_input": "-- CUT TO Carl with a bunch of kids. All the kids are folding brand new dollar bills into paper airplanes \n-- CUT TO Carl walking down the street, a big smile on his face, taking everyone's fliers as per usual. He walks past a CULTY GUY named TONY who's passing out books. \nTONY Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism? \nCarl takes one of the books. \nTONY (cont'd) Would you like to have tea and discuss? \nCARL I'm kind of in a rush... \nTONY My place is right around the corner. \nINT. TONY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCarl's sitting awkwardly on the floor across from Tony.   They are both drinking tea. \nTONY It is only through the four noble truths and the destruction of desire that we can end suffering. \nCARL Well, that's really neat. (awkward beat) So, thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry, but I have to go -- \nTONY Do you like Dionne Warwick? \nTony flips on Dionne Warwick's \"I Say a Little Prayer.\" \nTONY (cont'd) Now she had style. \nCARL It was really great meeting you -- \nTONY C'mon, Carl. Shake your groove thang. \nTony pulls Carl up.    Carl starts to awkwardly shake his groove thing. \nTONY (cont'd) I like big guys. \nCARL I really have to go. \nTony grabs Carl and kisses him full on the lips. \nTONY Want to go into my bedroom? \nCLOSE IN on Carl's face.      He looks down on the \"Yes\" that's on his palm. \nCARL (very quiet) Yes. \nCarl and Tony head into his bedroom. \nINT. TONY'S BEDROOM \nCARL Do you have any candles?      I just love candles. \nTONY Sure. \nTony instantly pulls out candles and lights them. \nCARL How about wine?       Like a bottle of Beaujolais? \nTONY I only have Beaujolais Nouveau. \nTony pulls out a bottle of wine and two glasses.     Tony goes in to kiss Carl. \nCARL I have herpes. \nTONY Upstairs or downstairs? \nCARL Downstairs? \nTONY Front door or back door? \nCARL It's a swinging door! \nTONY Just give it! \nTony pushes Carl down onto the bed. \nINT. PETER'S LAW OFFICE \nCarl's sitting across from Peter in Peter's fancy law office. They're each eating burgers. \nPETER What's with the kitten? \nPULL BACK to reveal a kitten on Peter's desk. \nCARL I just adopted her. If you're interested, they're giving them away in front of Petco. \nPETER I don't want a kitten. \nCARL Neither did I. \nPETER'S SECRETARY Andy Solomon on line two. \nPeter picks up the phone. \n", "test2_true": "Peter hangs up. \nPETER (cont'd) (totally normal) I spoke to Kath. I hear you met her boyfriend, Seb. \nCARL Seems like a nice guy. \nPETER She was upset you went on her date. \nCARL He asked me to join them. \nPETER I think you're taking this too far. \nCARL I have no choice. I'm a yes man. I must say yes. If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must. If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back. If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up with him. \nPETER You hooked up with a dude? \nCARL It's like hooking up with a strong woman. I honestly don't see what the big deal is. (back on his yes rant) I am guided by yes. Yes has become my superpower. And let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal. Now if you'll excuse me I'm late for Korean class. \nPETER You hate Korean food. \nCARL That's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture. See you later, buddy. \nCarl heads off, the kitten under his arm. \nINT. GALLERY \nCarl walks around a photography gallery. Renee's photos are up. They are terrible photos, since they were taken while she was jogging. Their subjects are blurry. Some of them are half in the photo and half out. The featured photo is of Carl throwing up on the ground. \nCARL You really are displaying that. \nRENEE That's probably my best photo ever. My collages aren't bad. But personally, I think I excel at pottery. \nRenee POINTS to a LARGE, BROWN PLATE that looks like poo. \nCARL Wow. That's really big. How do you have time for all this stuff? \nRENEE How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here? I almost skipped that one. \nCARL You gave me the flier, so I had to go. \nRENEE At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared. But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out -- \nCARL Do you want to go out sometime? \nRENEE Yes, I would. \nCARL By the way, I do other stuff besides follow you around. \nRENEE Like what? \nCARL I take Korean. \nRENEE In that case, what do you say we do Korean? \nINT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - LATER \nCarl's eating across from Renee. He can't stand the food. He grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down. \nRENEE Do you want any more squid hot pot? It's really good here. \nCARL I think I'm good.   To have some more. \nRenee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates. \nCARL (cont'd) So, all this art you create.   What do you want to do with it? \nRENEE What do you mean? \nCARL Like, do you want to open a store? \nRENEE Where I can sell my photos and pottery? Of course not. They're terrible. \nCarl's surprised that she knows this. \nCARL They're not terrible. \nRENEE Yeah, they're awful. \nCARL I think you're being hard on yourself -- \nRENEE I'm not asking for sympathy. My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets. (MORE) \nRENEE (cont'd) (as if    telling a secret) Besides, I    can't open a store. My big master    plan is to take a trip around the    world. \nCARL When?   Like in a couple years? \nRENEE I bought a ticket for four months from now. \nCARL People always talk about that, but you're actually doing it. \nRENEE Honestly, I'm terrified. (THEN) How about you? Do you like the bank? \n", "test2_id": 1600, "test3_input": "CARL (cont'd) I'm sorry. \nLUCY You've been so good to me. I've really come to depend on you. I want to pay you back. \nCARL Not necessary. \nLUCY Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days. \nCARL For some reason, the bank keeps promoting me. \nLUCY If you want to look at some open houses, I'm happy to waive my fee. \nINT. LUXURIOUS APARTMENT - DAY \nCarl and Lucy walk into a luxurious apartment. Gourmet kitchen, floor to ceiling windows, giant media center. \nLUCY So this is at the very top end of what you could probably afford. Are you interested? \nCarl hits a button.    A GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN DESCENDS. \nCARL Yes. \nLUCY Are you sure? I mean, this is the first place you've looked -- \nCARL Yes.    I've got to run. \nLUCY I'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight. \nCARL What? \nLUCY We're all having dinner.    Tonight. Remember? \nCARL Right.   Of course. \nCarl runs out. \nINT. BLOOD BANK \nCarl giving blood while on the phone. \nCARL (on the phone) I just think if we're going to be rolling out a no interest financing campaign we should commit hard. \nHe checks his watch.    The NURSE walks by. \nCARL (cont'd) (covering the phone) Can you unhook me? I have a really important meeting. \nNURSE If you're interested in donating plasma, feel free to sign up. \nINT. UFO CONFERENCE \nCarl's listening to a lecture. \nWEIRD PROFESSOR Between 1996 and 2000 England's Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs. This classified study was code named Project Condign. \nCarl's phone rings. People look angrily at him.    He stands and PASSES OUT in the aisle. \nEXT. FANCY RESTAURANT \nCarl PULLS UP and RUNS inside. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT \nHis friends are all waiting.    Carl pulls Renee aside. \nCARL I'm sorry I'm late. \nRENEE That's fine. It's only the very first time I've met your friends. \nCARL It was work, it went crazy late. \nCarl takes a breath.    He's about to pass out. \nRENEE What's with the \"They're Out There\" and \"I Gave\" button? \nREVEAL Carl's sporting buttons that say \"They're Out There\" and \"I Gave.\" \nCARL Long story. (to the hostess) Miss, could I have an orange juice? Like fast? \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nRenee, Carl, Kath, Seb, Peter and Lucy sit around a table at a nice restaurant. As per usual, Carl has several different meals in front of him. He also has a martini, a glass of water, and a glass of orange juice. Carl's showing off to his friends. As he shows off, Renee looks irritated. \nCARL (showing off, to Peter) Your wife found me a really great place. Built in Bose surround sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen TV, roof deck with jacuzzi. \nLUCY Least I could do. At least he's involved with our wedding. \nPETER (ignoring Lucy's tone) I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss? \nCARL Oh, this old thing?   Prada, I think. \nRENEE You think? We went to three different Prada stores to find the right fit. \nLUCY What do yo do for a living, Renee? \n", "test3_true": "CARL You should check out her pottery. It's really big. \nRENEE It is big.     How about you guys? \nLUCY Real estate broker. \nPETER/KATH/SEB Lawyer. \nQuiet beat.   The conversation's not exactly flowing easily. \nPETER If you'll excuse me. \nPeter leaves.   The waiter comes over. \nWAITER Have you made a decision about the wine? \nCARL Well, we're kind of in a celebratory mood. \nWAITER In that case, may I suggest a 97 Petit Rothschild? \nThe Waiter points at a wine that costs $400 a bottle. \nCARL Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide. \nLUCY He doesn't know crap about wine. Just pick one, Carl. \nCarl is sweating bullets. \nCARL Why not?   Let's celebrate. \nWAITER With six people, I'd recommend two bottles. \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LATER \nEveryone's drinking the wine.    Carl's terrified of the bill. \nLUCY Do you rent or own? \nRENEE I sublet.    I have this corner of a loft. \nCARL It's a really nice corner though. \nLUCY If you're ever interested in buying, you should ring me up. \nRENEE I hate owning things. Because when you own something, you suddenly are invested in that thing not breaking. And I break everything. I've gone through three TVS in three years. \nSEB How did you break them? \nRENEE I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz. So I set it on fire. \nCarl's friends don't really know what to say. The check comes. Carl grabs it before anyone else can. It's a $1500 bill. He drops several credit cards down on the table. \nCARL It's on me! (quietly to the waiter) I'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard, a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card. \nEXT. FANCY RESTAURANT \nCarl's outside with Peter. \nPETER Nice job with Renee. She's definitely odd, but that's not necessarily -- \nCARL I just spent $1500 on dinner. \nPETER What?   Why? \nCARL Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me! \nPETER Don't get mad at me about it.   You can just stop. \nCARL No I can't. If I didn't say yes to the band flier, I never would have met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip, I wouldn't be moving up. Each yes leads to the next one. If I stop, it could all fall apart. \nPETER You've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes. Just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy. \nCARL I don't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning. \nPETER I'm involved. \nCARL You told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory. \nPETER I can't see the difference. (opening up) Honestly, I'm terrified. \nCARL What?   Why? \nPETER It's marriage, you know?   The biggest thing ever. \nCARL But you guys have dated for years. \nPETER I know. \nCARL You're perfect for each other. \nPETER I know. \n", "test3_id": 1601}

MARROW No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell. 
And they go.  Three scared people. 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Luke sits on the closed toilet and watches Nell in the adjoining room.  Light from the bathroom falls across her fetal, curled form in the bed. 
The door to Theo's room is open too.  Luke glances over.  Theo lies on her bed.  Marrow is slouched in a chair. 
Luke settles back against the wall. 
The HOUSE EXHALES, and the breath of the house is like the poppy field in the Wizard of OZ; it brings on sleep. 
INT. THEO'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT 
Marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close.  Theo breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream. 
This is what the House wanted. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black with its strange plant-like splay of leaves. 
Nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her EYES OPEN.  She lies there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing something.  A long beat.  When she lets her breath out, we can see it in the cold. 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Luke's head rests solidly on the wall.  His eyes are closed, unaware his breath is fogging too. 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound. From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS.  At first it seems like someone is walking on the floor above.  But it is coming from within the room. 
The CARVINGS on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, ARE MOVING.  Incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  Carvings changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with some grand design we sense but cannot yet see. 
The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall bed POSTERS.  It crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy baroque curves, swelling them... 
The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell. Nell inclines her head to see.  Out of the wall two enormous BULGES grow, side by side. 
From behind Nell, now.  The headboard GROANS, its shapes moving, the fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide. 
Nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on. The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor.  And then we BEGIN TO SEE: they are like a pair of KNEES. 
Understanding starts to show in Nell's eyes.  She looks up at the ceiling.  And now all the movement, the design behind the awful transformation of the ceiling is clear. 
It is a HEAD.  A visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids sealing shut its blind face. 
Silence.  Nell's breath comes ragged.  Unable to speak, but trying to call out. 
The EYES OPEN.  A SCREAM tears out of Nell's throat. 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Luke is shocked awake in time to see Nell's room CONVULSE on her just before the DOOR SLAMS in his face. 
LUKE Oh my God... 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The entire ROOM RAMS itself at Nell, jolting her hard into the headboard.  THUMBS FOLD OUT of the woodwork, pinning her by the shoulders against it.  As the room lowers itself toward her, she SCREAMS out of her mind. 
INT. NELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Marrow lunges into the bathroom, thrown from sleep as Luke stares in impotent shock.  Theo is there behind Marrow an instant later. 
MARROW What is it? 
Luke can't make any words come out.  Marrow shoves him aside, grabs the doorknob and thrashes at it. 
MARROW (cont'd) Help me! 
He braces Luke up, and then they lunge together, shouldering the door.  It splinters out of its frame -- 
INT. NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
-- and stumble into Nell's room.  Marrow's mouth opens.  Luke stands speechless.  They're stricken by the sight: Nell SCREAMING, held by the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room THRUSTING at her rhythmically.  Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT. 
THEO Oh, Jesus. 
Marrow recovers, reaches out for Nell, and the FACE in the ceiling turns on him.  The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks.  He looks up into it and knows it's real.  Somehow, it is Crain. 
Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra. Nell screams in surprise, but Theo drags her out of the bed. 
The head turns to them.  They flee.  Marrow backs away in awe and fear. 
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

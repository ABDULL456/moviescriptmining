BEAR HANDLER It's really good. (Jackie and Clarence nod) Okay, so Spumoni is the safe word then? 
JACKIE MOON No, I don't need a safe word, okay? Let's just do this. One round. (nodding to the bell man) DING DING DING! The bell has rung. The crowd goes crazy. Clarence assumes his position as ref. Jackie walks slowly toward the bear, frightened. They bear scratches his belly, cute. Jackie immediately quits. 
JACKIE MOON (re: The scratching) Okay, fuck this. 
CLARENCE THE REF What? You can't quit already. 
JACKIE MOON SPUMONI. I'm out of here. 
CLARENCE THE REF You can't SPUMONI, all he did was scratch his nuts. 
JACKIE MOON Well, too bad, I'm SPUMONI-ING. PEOPLE START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd. 
CLARENCE THE REF You gotta give 'em a show. C'mon, the bear seems pretty tired, look at him. It's true, the bear is pretty docile. The bear's indifference gives Jackie a glimmer of confidence. 
CLARENCE THE REF Just test him out a little. Maybe it won't be so bad. Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air. Now he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the bear is still motionless. 
JACKIE MOON (tapping the bear) C'mon Dewie... (off screen) What's going on? Is he going to-- 
--THE BEAR MAULS JACKIE. LIKE LIGHTENING, JACKIE HAS ALREADY 
BEEN TACKLED AND STRANGLED AGAINST THE ROPES. 
JACKIE MOON 
AAAHHHHHH!!!!! 
CLARENCE THE REF Damn. 
BEAR HANDLER Woah-ho. I've never seen that before. 
THE CROWD IS GOING BALLISTIC. NOW THE BEAR THROWS JACKIE 
ACROSS THE RING LIKE A LIMP RAG DOLL. 
JACKIE MOON 
AAAHHH!!! SPUMONI!!! 
CLARENCE THE REF 
NO SPUMONI. 
JACKIE MOON 
FUCK YOU CLARENCE! SPUMONI! 
THE BEAR IS GOING BALISTIC. JACKIE TRIES TO CRAWL AWAY, BUT 
DEWIE JUMPS ON HIM, GRABS HIS HEAD AND TRIES TO RIP IT OFF OF 
HIS SHOULDERS. THIS BEAR HAS LOST HIS MIND. 
JACKIE MOON (to the handler) 
SPUMONI! 
ANIMAL HANDLER (to Clarence) 
I THINK MY BEAR'S SPOOKED, REF. I 
THINK YOU NEED TO CALL IT. 
CLARENCE THE REF 
NO. ONE ROUND. THIS IS WHAT HE 
WANTS, TRUST ME. 
GASPING FOR BREATH, JACKIE IS BEING SUFFOCATED BY A POWERFUL 
BEAR HUG. 
JACKIE MOON

EXT. BEAUMONTS' FRONT LAWN - DAY \nCLOSER ON WATER DROPLETS. The water droplets are somewhat abstracted as they dance in the light. \nPAN DOWN now to the green grass, traveling along the grass. \nThe MUSIC becomes fainter as we MOVE SUDDENLY under the grass, now as if in a dark forest. \nSLOWLY MOVING THROUGH. \nThe grass is like great timbers. \nIt is GETTING DARKER and ominous SOUNDS come up as we discover black insects crawling and scratching in the darkness. \nFADE TO: \n8.

AIRPORT - NIGHT \nJeffrey comes walking out of the airport, where his Mother and AUNT BARBARA, who is a very absent-minded little woman with very thick glasses, are waiting for him. \nThey are parked illegally and another car is honking at them.  Their trunk is open in anticipation of Jeffrey's things.  They are waving and yelling at Jeffrey to get his attention.  He finally joins them and kisses his Mother, then his Aunt. \nJEFFREY Hi Mom. Hi Aunt Barbara. \nThey AD LIB hellos. \nMRS.

Jeffrey. it's very important that your father doesn't try to move. he's been immobilized. It would be very painful for him. sit close. you do the talking and moving. He knows you're here. He became very emotional. I don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this. \nNurse Cindy goes to the bed.  She begins to pull the curtains back revealing Mr. Beaumont. \nNURSE CINDY (smiling a big smile) Mr. Beaumont! Your son is here to visit you. \nThen we see Mr. Beaumont.  He has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him.  A stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still.  Nurse Cindy picks up a tray and leaves. \nJEFFREY (shocked but concealing it) Hi Dad. \nMR. BEAUMONT (speaking as plainly as possible, but sounds like mumbling) Hey Jeff. \nJeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his father's hand but remembers his father cannot move.  Jeffrey pats him on the shoulder. \nJEFFREY Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good. \nMR. BEAUMONT (lips moving but hardly any sound) uh uh. \nJEFFREY Are you feeling okay? \nMR. BEAUMONT (more mumbling) uh uh. \nTears well up in Mr. Beaumont's eyes.  Before Jeffrey can stop him he reaches for Jeffrey's hand, then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words. \nMR. BEAUMONT (more plainly but under strain) Good to see you, son. \nJEFFREY (holding back tears) It's good to see you, Dad. \nJeffrey squeezes his father's hand. \n35. EXT. VACANT FIELD - DAY \nJeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home.  He kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks.  He has some time to think about things. He sees a green bottle in the distance. He gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses. \nHe looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange. \nHe looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants. \nJeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses - some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around - No one seems to be watching him. \nHe looks again at the ear. \nWe are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it. There is dried blood on part of it. \nJeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it.  Again, he stands up and looks around. \nIN THE DISTANCE, a MAN goes into the back door of a house.  Nothing more. \nJeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it. \nCUT TO: \n36. EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY \nJeffrey goes up the front steps... \n37. INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY \n... and to the Reception Desk.  A POLICE OFFICER is standing behind the counter. \nJEFFREY Hello. could you tell me if Detective Williams is still working here? \nPOLICE OFFICER He's up in Room 221. Right up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n38. \tINT. ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY \nJeffrey enters Room 221 and sees the desk marked, \"DETECTIVE J.D. WILLIAMS,\" however, the desk is empty.  TWO MEN are talking at the end of the room; one of them comes toward Jeffrey. \nJEFFREY Are you Detective Williams? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes. \nJEFFREY My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he? \nJEFFREY He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (matter of factly) You did? A human ear? \nJEFFREY Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it. \nJeffrey opens the bag and lets Detective Williams look inside. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (continuing) That sure looks like a human ear, doesn't it?. Let's run it down to the Coroner's Office and see what they make of it. Then, I want you to show me exactly where you found it. \nHe looks in a window.  Inside, he sees a nicely-lit living room. He goes ahead and knocks.  A very pleasant-looking middle class WOMAN answers the door. \nJEFFREY Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in? \nMRS. WILLIAMS Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent? \n47. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJEFFREY I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go. \nMRS. WILLIAMS Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee? \nJEFFREY (thinks a bit) Alright. \n48. INT.

WILLIAMS In the kitchen, John! \nDetective Williams comes into the kitchen surprised to see Jeffrey. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Oh. Hello, Jeffrey. what's up? \nHe kisses his wife. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Come into the study a minute. \nJEFFREY (getting up) Excuse me, Mrs. Williams. \nMRS. WILLIAMS Certainly. \nJeffrey follows Detective Williams into his study. \nCUT TO: \n51. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT \nDetective Williams' study is filled with filing cabinets.  The desk has two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of Mrs. Williams and Sandy.  The police radio is asking for Detective Williams as they enter. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (to Jeffrey) Shut the door. \nDetective Williams speaks through the radio while Jeffrey shuts the door. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (continuing; in radio) Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy. (clicks off radio, turns to Jeffrey) Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more. (scratches the middle of his back) But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't. \nJEFFREY I understand. I'm just real curious like you said. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business. \nJEFFREY It must be great. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS And it's horrible too. (a cold look comes over Detective Williams) I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand. \nSANDY I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case. \nJEFFREY Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything? \nSANDY My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. \nJEFFREY You really do hear a lot, don't you? \nSANDY Yeah, I guess so. (they continue walking) What are you going to do now that you're home? \nJEFFREY I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. \nSANDY Still, it must be kinda rough. \nJEFFREY It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. (Jeffrey points to a house) I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. \nJeffrey and Sandy both laugh. \nSANDY What happened to him? \nJEFFREY I don't know. he moved away. \nCUT TO: \n56. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT \nA LONG SHOT \nJeffrey and Sandy walking and talking, sometimes laughing in the distance, while the MUSIC theme, haunting yet warm, plays over. \n57. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT \nThey arrive back at Sandy's home. \nCLOSER ON JEFFREY AND SANDY \nin front of Sandy's home. \nSANDY I've gotta go in. \nJEFFREY Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. \nSandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk. \nJEFFREY (continuing) I guess I'll see you sometime. \nSANDY I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. \nJEFFREY (smiles) Yeah. Good bye. \nJeffrey watches as Sandy goes inside her house.  He watches her house for a moment and sees her cross the living room.  He turns and walks away. \nAgain, the MYSTERIOUS CHORDS OF MUSIC swell up as Jeffrey walks through the night. \nCUT TO: \n58. INT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nJeffrey is poking around in the back room.  He picks up some bug spraying devices.  He yells out to an old black man who works in the store. \nJEFFREY Hey, Ed, okay if I borrow these bug spraying rigs later on? \nEd peers into the back room.  Spots Jeffrey. \nED Listen Bud. If you need to spray for bugs they're yours.  It causes me no pain. \nJEFFREY Okidoke Ed. Thanks. \nCUT TO: \n59. EXT. BEAUMONT'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nJeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car.  There are several \"Awake\" magazines there too.  He gets in the front seat and drives off. \nCUT TO: \n60. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - DAY \nJeffrey driving.  He looks at his watch.  It is 3:30. \n61. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nJeffrey is parked across the street from the school.  High school kids are pouring out the front door.  In a moment he sees Sandy come out with two or three other girls.  They walk down the sidewalk away from Jeffrey. \nHe starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner, where he pulls up alongside of them. very close. Sandy suddenly recognizes him. \nJEFFREY You hungry or thirsty, or both? \nSANDY (taken back) I don't know. \nJEFFREY I'd like to talk to you about something. \nSANDY Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute. \nSandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then, \nSANDY (to the girls) Please, don't say anything to Mike. promise? \nJEFFREY Pest control. gotta do your apartment. \nDOROTHY Oh God, that stuff stinks. \nJEFFREY (as he goes in) Nope. it's new stuff. no smell. \nDOROTHY Oh yeah, that's good. \n68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nJeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's getting a good look around the apartment. \nThere is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying. The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed. \nSuddenly, there is knocking at the door. \nDOROTHY What is this. Grand Central Station? \nShe opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which Jeffrey cannot hear. \nThe next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. He wraps things up and gets out. \nJEFFREY (to Dorothy) That oughta do it. \nDOROTHY Yeah. \n69. \tINT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nJeffrey leaves.  Out on the stairs, he finds Sandy with her \"Awake\" magazines. \nSANDY Are you alright? \nJEFFREY Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened? \nAs they go downstairs, \nSANDY I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? \nJEFFREY Yes and no. Did you recognize him? \nSANDY No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. \nJEFFREY I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. (he shows it to her) Pretty nifty, huh? \nSANDY Yeah, if it opens the door. \nJEFFREY Yeah. \n70. \tINT. LOBBY - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nThey get to the door of the apartment building. \nJEFFREY You go first. \n71. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - DAY \nThey leave the building separately.  When Jeffrey gets to the car, Sandy isn't there.  He looks around.  He starts the car and drives off. \nThere, up ahead, he spots her.  He pulls over and she gets in. \nSANDY So. what's next? \nJEFFREY Pretty clever. Are you game for more? \nSANDY I owe you. since I goofed up this one. \nJEFFREY You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight? \nSANDY Yes. I do. \nJEFFREY Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that. \n72. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/WILLIAMS HOME - DAY \nJeffrey is driving Sandy home. \nSANDY You really want to do this, don't you? \nJEFFREY I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. \nThey pull up in front of Sandy's house. \nSANDY (making up her mind - against her better judgment) I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? \nJEFFREY (studies her a moment, then) First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings. \nSANDY I already know. The \"Slow Club.\" It's on Route 7. \nJEFFREY Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good? \nSANDY Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. \nJEFFREY Okay. You better get out before someone sees us. \nSandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her house.  Jeffrey calls out after her. \nJEFFREY See ya! \nJEFFREY Jeffrey. \nDOROTHY Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? \nJEFFREY Jeffrey nothing. \nDOROTHY You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. (reads his license) Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? \nJEFFREY I wanted to see you. \nDOROTHY What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? \nJEFFREY Nobody. \nDOROTHY Shit. You better tell me something. \nJEFFREY I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. \nDOROTHY An experiment?

You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more. \nDorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking. \nDOROTHY That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? \nJEFFREY Well. \nDOROTHY THEN WHAT? \nJEFFREY Then you got undressed. \nDOROTHY How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? \nJEFFREY (quietly; feeling guilty) Never before this. \nDOROTHY How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. (gets an idea) Get undressed. I want to see you. \nJEFFREY No. Come on. \nDOROTHY NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. \nJEFFREY Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave. \nDOROTHY No way. \nDorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared. \nDOROTHY Get undressed. I want to see you. \nJeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off.  Now he is only in his underwear. \nDOROTHY STAND UP. \nHe does. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Come closer. \nDorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him. \nDOROTHY (whispering) What do you want from me? \nJEFFREY (quietly, getting very hot) I . I don't know. \nDOROTHY (whispering) What do you want? \nDorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice. She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts. \nDOROTHY Don't move. don't look at me. \nJeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him. \nDOROTHY Do you like that? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nHe tries to touch her. \nDOROTHY Don't move or I'll kill you. \nShe looks at him. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Do you like talk like that? \nJEFFREY No. \nDOROTHY Lie down on the bed. \nHe lies down.  He looks frightened. \nJEFFREY I'll go then. \nHe starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn them around. \nDOROTHY Don? \nJEFFREY No. \nDOROTHY Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please. \nJeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her shoulders.  He moves down and holds her. \nDOROTHY (whispering) Thank you. honey. \nJEFFREY (whispering) It's okay. It's okay. \nThey lie together for a long silent moment. \nDOROTHY Do you like the way I feel? \nJEFFREY (hesitates) Yes. \nDOROTHY See my breasts?  . See? \nJeffrey looks. \nJEFFREY Yes. \nDOROTHY See my nipples? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nDOROTHY (whispering) You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard. \nJeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Go ahead. I don't mind. \nJeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts.  They both are getting very hot. \nDOROTHY Feel me. \nJeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him. \nDOROTHY You can hit me, if you want to. \nJEFFREY No. please. I won't. \nDorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall. \nJEFFREY Stop it! \nShe moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away. \nDOROTHY (whispering) Do you like me? \nJEFFREY (whispering) Yes, I like you. \nDOROTHY (whispering) You can be my special friend and come and put that in me. \nThey start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying. \nJEFFREY What's the matter? \nSuddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard. \nDOROTHY Get off me. \nJeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused. \nSuddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong. \n92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nShe is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes. He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock. \nDOROTHY I made it go down the toilet. \nJEFFREY What? \nHe looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears. \nDOROTHY I made it go down the toilet. \nJeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words \"look down\" on the mirror. \nHe looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood. \nJeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom. \n93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nFLASHBACK \nFrank in bathroom. \n94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope. Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS. \nJEFFREY (V.O.) This is what my father's disease looks like? \nDR. GYNDE Yes. \nThe BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving. \nThe Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then, even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving. \n103.

He speaks to the Maitre d'. \nJEFFREY A table in back, please. \nMAITRE D' Certainly \nDorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey. \nJEFFREY I'll have an ice-cold Heineken. \nMAITRE D' One Heineken, certainly, sir. \nJeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables away. \nFrank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, \"BLUE MOON,\" segues into \"BLUE VELVET.\"  This song she sings mainly to Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly. \nJeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside. \nEXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT \nHe looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n106. EXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT \nTraffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.

He has to gun the car up to sixty-five to catch up with them. \n107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nThe mysterious MUSIC plays. \nHe follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right. He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow street through dark factories. \n108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT \nDark, low MUSIC now. \nUp ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The electric lines above buzz loudly. \nJeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down. He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building. \n109. \tINT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nInside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26. \nIn the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves. \n110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT \n. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.  Frank comes out of the building and crosses to his car. \nJEFFREY (out loud to himself) I'll bet I know where you're going. \nHe follows Frank as he pulls out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n111. \tEXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nJeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car. He watches Frank leave the parking lot. \n112. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT \nHe follows Frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear.  He seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment. \n113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nJeffrey goes back to his car to wait. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nA storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone. \nJEFFREY (thinking out loud) I shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm too curious. and I have to try to help her. \nHe then gets out of his car as the wind is building. \n115. EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT \n119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \n. to a back stairway leading to the roof. \n120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very sad forlorn version of \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" - creeps through the wind. \nDOROTHY (as she stares down) Look. \nJEFFREY (turning to her quickly) No. \nDOROTHY (continuing to look down, her eyes widening - she whispers) Falling. \nJEFFREY No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble? \nHe moves closer to her. \nJEFFREY (continuing) Who is Don? \nDOROTHY (very crazy and angry) Don?. Are you in with them? \nJEFFREY (whispering) No. But you're in very big trouble. \nDOROTHY Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? \nJEFFREY I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.? \nDOROTHY Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nDOROTHY (whispering) . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. \nJEFFREY No. I should go. \nDOROTHY Please. please stay. \nShe makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof. \nJEFFREY Why Dorothy? \nWe move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it. \nDOROTHY Don? I have to make it hurt. I want there to be nothing again. Don!!! (as she slams her head again and again) \nShe reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls. \nFADE TO WHITE: \nFADE DOWN TO: \n121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT \nJeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky. The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n121A. \nDarkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to speak.  He's trying to say \"Jeffrey.\" \n121B. \nAnother dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close. There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound. \n121C. \nNow Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of Dorothy's which open into a scream. \n121D. \nJeffrey wakes in his room - terrified. \n122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nJeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room. \nJEFFREY Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house? \nAUNT BARBARA Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house. \nJEFFREY Oh yeah?. Have you seen any? \nAUNT BARBARA I've seen a few. \nJEFFREY Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go. \nAUNT BARBARA Okay honey. \nJeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down. \nIn EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls. \nWe GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house. \nCUT TO: \nFRANK (telephone V.O.) Speak to me Fucker. \nJeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared. \nJEFFREY (to himself) Stupid!! So stupid. now she might be in even more trouble with Frank. I hope not. I hope not. tomorrow I have to find out more about Frank. \n133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY \nJeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching. \nA LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps. Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures. \nWe see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man. \nJEFFREY Damn! \nHe replaces the cardboard box and continues eating. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY \nLater in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says \nAs he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure. \nJEFFREY Wow. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY \nJeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00. \nJEFFREY (out loud to himself) Fifteen more minutes. \nJust then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks, but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment. \nThe two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his. Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off. \n136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nThey drive through town. \n137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY \n. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. \"3:25\". \nJEFFREY You gotta wait for me Sandy. I'm on a real roll. \nHe quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase. \n138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY \n. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the end of the alley he turns left and stops short. \n139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY \nHe sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head. \nOn the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock. Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to them. \nJEFFREY What happened? \nGUY #1 He was blown away man. can't you see? \nGUY #2 That cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city, brother. the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe. It's a speedball heaven in there. \nJEFFREY Oh yeah? What about the woman? \nGUY #1 Probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time. \nJEFFREY Man oh brother. \nGUY #1 This is the way the world is my man. take a good look. \nJeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off. \nCUT TO: \n140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nJeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her. \nSANDY (looking beyond the car) GO ON!!!. GO! \nJeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey. Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off. \nSANDY Oh great. \n141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nSandy goes around and gets in the car. \nSANDY (continuing) You were late. \nJEFFREY I'm really sorry. \nShe moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue. She gets down in a pose and holds it. \nDOROTHY I'm a statue. you can feel me.you can do anything you want. \nJeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nJeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness. \nDOROTHY (dreamily) What do you want to do? \nJEFFREY I'm doing it. \nDOROTHY Are you a bad boy? \nJEFFREY Whatiya mean? \nDOROTHY Do you want to do bad things?

I think I know some of what is happening to you. (she doesn't react) . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police. \nDOROTHY No police!!!. (pushing herself back against the headboard; then frantic) No police!! \nSuddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has a frightening little girl smile. \nDOROTHY You like to open me. don't you? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nDOROTHY (thinking with a grin) What if I told Frank that you opened me? \nFor just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment. It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy. \nJEFFREY That wouldn't be too good, would it? \nDOROTHY Frank would open you. \nJEFFREY Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone. \nDOROTHY (smiles very strangely) Does that scare you? \nJEFFREY Shut up. \nDOROTHY Beeeee careful. \nJEFFREY (scared and mad) Come on Dorothy. \nDOROTHY What if Frank came over here and found us? \nThe curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind. \nJEFFREY Look, snap out of it, will ya? \nDOROTHY Kiss me. \nThey kiss. \nDOROTHY (continuing) Do you love me? \nJEFFREY Do you love me? \nDOROTHY I asked first. \nJEFFREY Sometimes I think I do. \nDOROTHY And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! \nShe bolts up. \nJEFFREY Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! \nDOROTHY Just get outta my bed. \nShe hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the wall.  She smiles through the pain. \nJEFFREY Oh God. are you alright. \nShe falls on him and smothers him with kisses. \nDOROTHY See. see how you hurt me? Now. Open me. enter me. \nJeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness. \nWe move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper into it. \nDOROTHY I love you Don with all my heart. \nJEFFREY No. it's not Don. \nBut he can't stop himself or her from making love. \nDOROTHY Come inside me. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. (very frantic) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. \n147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nFrank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway. \nCUT TO: \n148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT \nFrank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn green, Frank lays rubber. \nFRANK Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see Ben. We gotta, right? \nPAUL (laughing) Yeah. we gotta see Ben. \nThe car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions because of the speed of Frank's car. \nDriving music plays. Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, mostly in fear. \nRaymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes. \n149. EXT. \"BARBARY COAST\" - NIGHT \nFrank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey. \nFRANK Come on.

BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large doll. \nFRANK (getting higher all the time) Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer? \nBEN (smiling) Certainly Frank. (to the fat woman) Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down? \nEveryone kinds of mills around.

I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too. \nDOROTHY (very anxious) Frank? \nFRANK You want to see him too, right? \nDOROTHY Yes, but. \nFRANK Then, shut up! \nFrank sees Dorothy look back at Jeffrey. \nFRANK (continuing) Hey. What's this fuck got to do with anything. \n159. INT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nFrank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down it, screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees.  He turns violently around to Jeffrey. \nFRANK What are you lookin' at? \nJEFFREY Nothing. \nFRANK (locks eyes with Jeffrey; long pause) Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes. (takes helium) You like me?. \nJeffrey is quiet. \nFRANK (still high voice) Look at these. What are these? \nDOROTHY Come on, Frank. Let's go.

Give 'em back. They're just a little red, that's all. let me feel 'em again. Come here. \nFrank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her and she is frightened and in pain. \nJEFFREY Hey. leave her alone. \nFrank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard. She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face. Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at Jeffrey. \nFRANK NEXT! . out of the car fuck. HELP HIM OUT, RAYMOND!! \n160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT \nFrank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously. \nDOROTHY Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it. \nFRANK Shut up. Gimme your lipstick. (takes gas) . Hey, pretty, pretty. \nDorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick heavy onto his lips. \nWhile Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth. \nDOROTHY LEAVE HIM ALONE!! FRANK!! \nFrank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car again. \nFRANK (to Jeffrey) You're fuckin' lucky to be alive. LOOK AT ME! \nRaymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and the Greasy Girl watch in terror. \nFRANK Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nFRANK I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck! \nFrank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins feeling Jeffrey's face with it. \nFRANK (continuing; breathing heavily) You feel good. feel my muscles. \nRaymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps. \nFRANK (continuing) You like that? (to Raymond and Paul) Hold him tight for me. \nSuddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the car window. \nCUT TO BLACK: \n161. \tEXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY \nNO SOUND.

ROOM 221 - POLICE STATION - DAY \nHe rounds the corner and steps inside the office, when he stops short with fear.  Detective Williams is not there, but sitting at a desk next to Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock. \nJeffrey freezes. \nJEFFREY Excuse me. \nJeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on his desk. \nAgain the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he cooks his head.  Jeffrey cannot move. \nFinally, Jeffrey is able to step away.  As he leaves the Yellow Man's line of sight, Jeffrey catches the names on the door. \nDETECTIVES J.R. WILLIAMS AND T.R.

WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT \nJeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in front of Detective Williams' house and hesitates.  Jeffrey's face has a troubled look.  He approaches the front door. \nHe hesitates again before finally knocking.  Detective Williams answers the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's face, she knows why he's there. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey! Come on in. \nJEFFREY Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. \nJEFFREY (with a goofy smile to Sandy) Yeah. \n180. INT.

I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this. \nHe shows him the picture of Frank and studies Detective Williams' face as he sees it. \nJEFFREY (continuing) This is Frank Booth. His address is on the back of the photo. He, in my opinion, is very sick and dangerous. This photo here is of Frank with another man as they went into Frank's apartment. \nJeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches Detective Williams' face extra carefully.  Detective Williams doesn't flinch, yet his eyes slowly glide upwards to meet Jeffrey's. \nJEFFREY (continuing) And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son. \nJEFFREY (continuing) I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. (he decides not to tell Detective Williams everything) . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved? \nJEFFREY I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Is Sandy part of this? \nJEFFREY No. not at all. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (referring to the photos) Who knows you have these? \nJEFFREY Only you. and the photo lab. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS You're all through with this now? \nJEFFREY Yes sir. I sure am. \nDetective Williams studies Jeffrey, then the photos. \nThey enter the living room.  Mrs. Williams comes in from the kitchen. \nSANDY (hurrying) Is Dad home? \nMRS. WILLIAMS (shocked at sight) No. \nSANDY You better call him and get an ambulance too. \nDorothy is clinging to Jeffrey.  Mrs. Williams goes to call. \nSandy moves closer.

I opened myself to you. Okay, okay, okay, okay? \nMrs. Williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing Sandy.  Sandy is crying now and turns away. \nJEFFREY Sandy? ...Sandy, please. \nMRS.

Mrs. Williams is shaking. \nThe Paramedics enter the house. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n203. EXT. WILLIAMS' HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe PARAMEDICS are loading Dorothy into the ambulance on a stretcher.

Police cars line the street along with a huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building. Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance. \nPOLICEMAN #1 He hasn't fired a shot for six minutes. maybe we got him. get on the radio. get Detective Williams. ask him if we can rush the son of a bitch. \nA policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none are returned.  The policeman comes running back. \nPOLICEMAN #2 It's in the works already. we're in there. they're goin' down the back stairs now. It won't be long. and they'll have us rush 'em from here. one whistle and we go. \nSuddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment. Then a loud whistle. \nPOLICEMAN #1 That's it. let's go. \nPolice race across the street to Frank's building. \n213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPolice kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a corner.  Every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth. \n214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment. \nJEFFREY (speaking to T.R. Gordon who doesn't hear him because he's almost dead) I'm leaving now. I'll let them find you all on their own. find all this horror on their own. (whispers) Good bye. \nHe goes out and closes the door. \n215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs. \nJEFFREY So. Frank escaped. \nHe rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man. It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a police radio. \nJEFFREY (to himself) Frank's car. Is this man a cop? He has a radio!. So did Frank though and he's no cop. that's for sure. and he's driving Frank's car. who is he? \nThe man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey. \nJeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster. \nJEFFREY What happened that day?. \n216. EXT. FRONT STREET - DAY \nFLASHBACK: \nJeffrey remembers Frank and the Yellow Man go into Frank's building. \n217. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nJEFFREY (V.O.)

STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nJEFFREY and out came. No it couldn't be. But I think it is!! It's Frank!! \nJeffrey runs like mad up to Dorothy's apartment.  He looks back once and sees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs. \nCLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good disguise. \nJeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it and it drops to the floor. \nFrank climbs the stairs. \nFinally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes into the room. \n220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket. He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed. \nJEFFREY (into the radio) Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!! \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (over radio) Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? \nJEFFREY Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment. (thinks; hits himself in the forehead; inner voice) Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!! (thinks some more - fast) Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can. \n221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT \nSandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which says \"Lincoln.\" \n222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room. He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank is smiling. \nFRANK (calling pleasantly in the direction of the back bedroom) Hey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot I have a police radio. I know where your cute little butt is hiding. Here I come! Ready or not! \nHe starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays. \n", "test1_input": "JEFFREY (raising his glass) Here's to. an interesting experience. \nSANDY I'll drink to that. \nThey drink. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n77. INT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT \nLater. Jeffrey and Sandy have just finished dinner.  The M.C. is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a SAXOPHONE PLAYER, a BASS PLAYER, and a DRUMMER are on stage. \nM.C. (very low key) Ladies and gentlemen. The Blue Lady. Miss Dorothy Vallens. \nThere is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage. \nShe smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines of \"BLUE MOON\" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, \"Blue.\" This is a very sexy and slow version of the song. \nDuring the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into. \nJeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, \"BLUE VELVET.\" They hear the first few lines before they get out the door. \n78. EXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT \nThey hurry to the car, get in, and drive off. \nCUT TO: \n79. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR - NIGHT \nJeffrey and Sandy drive through dark areas of the city.  They don't talk as they drive, but again they sneak glances at one another. \n80. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT \nThey turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine. \nIt is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard. Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building. \nSANDY Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. \nJEFFREY Why not? \nSANDY It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you. \nJEFFREY It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car? \nSANDY Yeah. but. \nJEFFREY Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? \nSANDY O.K. \nJEFFREY Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. \nSANDY . I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. \nJEFFREY I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went. \nSANDY I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. \nJEFFREY Oh, okay. can I call? \nSANDY Okay. yeah, call. \nJEFFREY Look. it can wait till Sunday. \nSANDY Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? \nJEFFREY Yeah. \nSANDY I'm going to wait here until she comes. \nJEFFREY Are you sure? \nSANDY I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay? \nJeffrey nods. \nJEFFREY Okay. thanks. \nSANDY I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. \nJEFFREY That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay? \nSANDY Okay, okay. Bye. \nJeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently. \nJeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and sits in the driver's seat. \nCUT TO: \n81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nJeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor. \nSOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor. \n", "test1_true": "Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710. He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key. It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens. \n82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom. \nAcross the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns. The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door. He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see. Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths. He looks at his watch.  It says \"10:17.\" \n83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT \nSandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and street. \n84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIn the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45. \nJEFFREY (to himself) Oh no, hurry up Dorothy. Come on!. and I gotta pee. Great. it's now or never. \nJeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise.  He freezes. \n85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nHe moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee. \nJEFFREY Heineken. \nCUT TO: \n86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT \nSuddenly Sandy sits up alert. \n87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nA car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into the building. \nCUT TO: \n88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud. \n89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT \nSandy begins to honk the horn. \n90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nUnable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling. \nSUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens. \nJust as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door. \nDOROTHY (V.O.) (we're watching Jeffrey trying to control frightened breathing in the dark closet) Thanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a drink, or something? \nJIMMY (V.O.) I better get back. thanks anyway. \nDOROTHY Goodnight. \nJIMMY Goodnight now. \nThe front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when the phone RINGS. \nShe turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out. He thought he'd had it.  He overhears. \nDOROTHY (on the phone) Hello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me talk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like to sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay. Don't worry. Don??. can you hear me? Is little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You mean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the matter with him? I know. When? Okay. In an hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you. Okay Frank, sir. \nShe hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands. \nDOROTHY (to herself) Frank, you son of a bitch! \nShe goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, \"FOR YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE.\"  She sits back down and chews her nail again, listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off her dress. \nUnderneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, goes down the hallway into the bathroom. \nJeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and we HEAR her start a SHOWER. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nJeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again. He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can. \nShe opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It CLICKS shut. \nJeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING. \nHe HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it. She slowly gets up. \nJeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view. \nSUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud. \nDOROTHY (crazy scream, then) GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? \n", "test1_id": 2574, "test2_input": "JEFFREY Well. (looking around, feeling funny) Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean? \nJust then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey. She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her. \nMRS. WILLIAMS Mike?. Are you alright? \nMike starts upstairs. \nMIKE (mumbling) Yes. \nDownstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs. \nMIKE Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute? \nSANDY (calling up) Sure. just a sec. (to Jeffrey) Excuse me. \n125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nUpstairs, Mike is by the front door. \nMIKE Come on out a minute, okay? \nSANDY Okay. \nThey leave. \n125A. INT.

WILLIAMS Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. \nJEFFREY Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? \nMRS. WILLIAMS Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon. \nDetective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Jeffrey? \nJEFFREY Yes? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures. \n126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT \nJeffrey enters Detective Williams' study. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (continuing) Take a look at these. These are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear. You might find them interesting. \nJeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them. \nJEFFREY These are beautiful. How's the case coming? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Okay. \nJEFFREY Anything you can tell me? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS The criminals are winning. \nJEFFREY Is that why you say it's horrible? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes. \nJEFFREY I guess you've seen some bad things. \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you. \nJEFFREY Why do you do it? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance. \nJEFFREY Yeah. I get it. \nSuddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks. \nJEFFREY What is this? What color is it? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS (leaning over to see) Blue. It's Blue Velvet. \nSandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams puts the photos away. \nSANDY Can I use the car for a while? \nDETECTIVE WILLIAMS Sure. What's up? \nSANDY I want to buy Jeffrey a Dairy Queen. \nJEFFREY A Dairy Queen? (he holds his stomach) Oh yeah? Sure, that sounds great. \nCUT TO: \n127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT \nJeffrey gets in and Sandy starts the car.  She pulls out.  They drive away. \nJEFFREY What's with Mike? \n", "test2_true": "JEFFREY I'm sorry, I didn't. \nSANDY It's okay.

WILLIAMS CAR/CHURCH - NIGHT \nSandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church. The church pipe-organ music drifts softly into the night. \nSANDY You want to tell me about it? \nJEFFREY . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the \"yellow man\". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man. \nSANDY (quietly) Wow. Should you tell my father? \nJEFFREY I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. \nSANDY You saw a lot in one night. \nJEFFREY . Actually. I've been in twice. \nSANDY (uneasy) Twice. without her sensing anything? \nJEFFREY (lying) Yes. \nSANDY (pausing) Did you see her undressed? \nJEFFREY Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know. \nSANDY Yeah? \nJEFFREY (a searching, slight smile) That doesn't bother you, does it? \nSANDY Who, me? Why should it? \nJEFFREY (seeing some jealousy and and happy for it) That's what I thought. \nSANDY You're sure right. It is a strange world. \nJEFFREY Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.? \nSANDY I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. (she reflects silently on this before proceeding) . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble. \nJEFFREY Yeah I guess so. (he turns to her) You're a neat girl. \nSANDY So are you. (laughs) I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. \nJEFFREY I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. \nSandy starts the car and pulls out into the street.  They begin driving back. \n129. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT \nSANDY No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned.

I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay? \nThey pull up in front of Jeffrey's house. \nSANDY Okay. be careful. \nJEFFREY Okay, Sandy. \n130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT \nJeffrey gets out of the car.  He goes around to her side and looks down at her in the car.  She looks very beautiful.  He stands there for a moment. \nJEFFREY Can I give you a kiss good night? \nSANDY (pauses, trembling) You better not, Jeffrey. \nJEFFREY Okay. okay. \nSANDY Goodnight. \nJEFFREY See ya tomorrow. \nSandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes inside his house. \n131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, \"Jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom.\"  A postscript is written on the note by Aunt Barbara.  \"Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt Barbara.\"  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites. He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement. \n132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a \"click\" but no one speaks. Jeffrey instinctively speaks. \nJEFFREY Hello? \n", "test2_id": 2575, "test3_input": "Jeffrey starts the car and pulls out. \nSANDY What was that all about? \nJEFFREY Nothing. really! It's good to see you. \nSANDY It's good to see you. \nJEFFREY Where to? \nSANDY Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far.

Jeffrey feels a little out of place. \nA COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy. The music is loud, fast dancing music. \nSANDY You want to dance? \nJEFFREY I can't dance fast. \nSANDY Really? \nJEFFREY Really. you want to dance with someone else? \nSANDY NO. \nJEFFREY Let's wait for some slow one. \nSANDY Just a minute. \nSandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey. \nSANDY Don't worry. I took care of it. You want something to drink? \nJust then, the music goes slow. \nJEFFREY You want to dance? \nSANDY Okay. \nThey begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together. They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song. They finally, as they say, come up for air. \nSANDY I love you, Jeffrey. \nThey kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes. \nJEFFREY (inner voice) I really do love you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n191. INT.

Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.  Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.  They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street. \nAs soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off. \n194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT \nThe dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's car in the rear. \nJeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street. \nSANDY Oh my God. What's wrong? \nJEFFREY Frank!! \nHe swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a driveway. \nJEFFREY (continuing; referring to the car ahead) Come on. MOVE IT! \nJeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street, passing \"Lincoln St.\" \nJEFFREY I can't outrun this guy. \nHe floors the car and flies down another street very fast. \nJEFFREY My father has a gun at home. \n", "test3_true": "JEFFREY Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you. \nSandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling noisily down the street. \nSANDY Try to get to my house. then my father can. \nCLOSEUP ON JEFFREY \n195. INT.

Now it swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams. \nSANDY It's Mike! It's Mike! \nJeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike. \n197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT \nHe pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out. \nMIKE (out of the car; very drunk) Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house. \nSANDY ... Stop it Mike. \nMIKE (to Sandy) You shut up. nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother? \nEveryone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.  She has been ravaged. \nJEFFREY Dorothy! ... Dorothy! \nSANDY Dorothy Vallens? \nJEFFREY Yes. \nHe jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike comes after him. \nMIKE (going for Jeffrey) Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE! \nJEFFREY (pushing Mike off) Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed. \nSANDY Mike, go home. \nMike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey. Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back up and glances at Mike. \nMIKE (dull, very drunk) Hey, I'm sorry. Hey. \nJeffrey gets into the car. \nJEFFREY Yeah. okay, Mike. \nJeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in the front seat. \nSANDY Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her? \nJEFFREY (starts the car) No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house? \nSANDY Probably not. no. Why? \nJEFFREY OK. Let's get her over to your father's. \nSANDY (looking quickly from Dorothy to Jeffrey) Right. Watch out for Mike, there. \nMike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches out and screeches to a stop.

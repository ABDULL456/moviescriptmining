The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. \nJEFFREY Do you know who was brought in for questioning? \nSANDY There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others. \nJEFFREY Were all these people questioned this afternoon? \nSANDY No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing.

Do you know what building the woman lives in? \nSANDY Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. \nJEFFREY I guess you have to get back home soon? \nSANDY Not really, why?

They think he's been murdered. \nJEFFREY You really do hear a lot, don't you? \nSANDY Yeah, I guess so. (they continue walking) What are you going to do now that you're home? \nJEFFREY I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice. \nSANDY Still, it must be kinda rough. \nJEFFREY It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.

Sandy suddenly recognizes him. \nJEFFREY You hungry or thirsty, or both? \nSANDY (taken back) I don't know. \nJEFFREY I'd like to talk to you about something. \nSANDY Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute. \nSandy pulls her girlfriends away from Jeffrey's car and says something to them.  There is some whispering and giggling and then, \nSANDY (to the girls) Please, don't say anything to Mike. promise? \n", "test2_true": "JEFFREY I don't want to cause any trouble. \nSANDY I'm here, aren't I? \nJEFFREY (smiling as though he knew) I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon. \nSANDY Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. \nCUT TO: \n62. INT. DINER - DAY \nJeffrey and Sandy are sitting in a booth.  Jeffrey's grilled cheese on white bread and a coke have just arrived along with Sandy's coke. \nSANDY Alright, now tell me. What is it? \nJEFFREY There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe. \nSANDY You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. \nJEFFREY Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan? \nSANDY (thinking and intrigued, plus she is beginning to like Jeffrey) It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. \nJEFFREY (getting excited) Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. \nSANDY Now, how are you going to do that? \nJEFFREY Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window. \nSANDY What will I say when she comes to the door? \nJEFFREY You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few \"Awake\" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think? \nSANDY I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous. \nJEFFREY Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. \nSANDY You've got a point there. \nCUT TO: \n63. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET-DAY \nJeffrey and Sandy are in the car.  Jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls. \nJEFFREY Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor. and finds Number 710. He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty. \nDOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick wavy hair.  Full red lips.

It is very dark and smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables away. \nFrank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious- looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, \"BLUE MOON,\" segues into \"BLUE VELVET.\"  This song she sings mainly to Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly. \nJeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside. \nEXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT \nHe looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.

Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The electric lines above buzz loudly. \nJeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.

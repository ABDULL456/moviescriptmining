RAMONA I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess. 
SCOTT You can't say I didn't try. I really fought for you back there. 
RAMONA Uh-huh. The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away. 
RAMONA But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany, 
SCOTT Knives? 
RAMONA I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand. 
SCOTT I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees. 
SCOTT So...so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott. 
SCOTT Ahhhhhh... We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart. 
SCOTT

SCOTT 
...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I 
HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN! 
SOME GUY (O.S.) Again? 
WALLACE (O.S.) Turn off the light! Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK... 
SCOTT Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you. 
WALLACE (O.S.) Sure thing, guy. 
SCOTT Could you put a robe on and hand me the phone? Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone. 
SCOTT Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon Graves. 
(BEAT) Tell him Scott Pilgrim is calling. 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Scott. I was just about to- 
SCOTT Hey, pal. I feel terrible about everything. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call. 
GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Um...

SCOTT Sorry, what I meant to say is 'I'm coming over to kill you'. Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore.

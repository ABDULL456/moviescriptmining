{"test1_input": "EXT. RIVER BANK. DAY \nAn eddy under a willow tree. The end of the canoe is tied to a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore. Sam covers the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine- needles. \nEXT. ROCKY GORGE. DAY \nSam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the bottom. He wears a compass on a string around his neck. \nCUT TO: \nA binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide meadow. The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves. He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction and then back the other while he stares at the dial. He looks up again. He walks onward. He stops. \nEXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY \nSuzy lowers her binoculars. She stands at the end of a path cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips part. Sam comes onto the path. He stops ten feet away from Suzy. \nSam and Suzy stare at each other. Silence. (NOTE: Suzy is slightly taller than Sam.) \nINSERT: \nA poster box with St. Jack's Church across the top. A purple- ink mimeographed page is stapled to a bulletin board inside under the heading Summer Pageant, 1964. It reads: \nBENJAMIN BRITTEN'S \"NOYE'S FLUDDE\" Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance \nCUT TO: \nDusk. A brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the bay. It is overgrown with ivy and wisteria. There is a cemetery with a low wrought-iron fence. An organ plays inside. \nTITLE: \nOne Year Earlier \nINT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. EVENING \nA play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised. \nKhaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle. He looks bored. \nA baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform watches him from the end of the pew, frowning. \nCUT TO: \nSam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that \nwinds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large woman stares through a small window into the church with her hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent. Pause. \nMrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to wait. \nSam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING \nSam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks THROUGH AT: \nFive eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls turn around quickly, covering themselves. \nSam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy: \nSAM What kind of bird are you? \nSuzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says in a bossy voice: \nBOSSY GIRL I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and -- \nSam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing: \nSAM No, I said, \"What kind of bird are you?\" \nThe other girls all look to Suzy. Pause. \nSUZY I'm a raven. \nSuzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl frowns. \n", "test1_true": "Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly: \nSAM I'll be leaving soon. \nSam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in a bandage. \nSAM What happened to your hand? \nSUZY (PAUSE) I got hit in the mirror. \nSAM (TAKEN ABACK) Really. How'd that happen? \nSUZY (SHRUGS) I lost my temper at myself. \nSam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches Sam nervously. \nSUZY What's your name? \nSAM Sam. What's yours? \nSUZY I'm Suzy. \nSam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes. \nBOSSY GIRL It's not polite to stare. \nSam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking. Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway. \nMRS. LYNN Birds! Ready? \nMrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam: \nMRS. LYNN Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go back to your seat. \nSam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their feet. She says quietly: \nSKINNY GIRL He likes you. \nEXT. CHURCH YARD. EVENING \nTroops flood out from one side of the church while children in animal costumes flood out from the other. They criss-cross among grave-markers and head-stones. Sam stops abruptly, face to face with the skinny owl. She whispers something, points behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's hand. \nINT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT \nA vehicle crowded with scouts. Sam sits alone in the back row. He stares into space, entranced. \nCUT TO: \nSuzy on-stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the air, spreading her wings. She is surrounded by the entire cast of singing animals. The music soars. \nCUT TO: \nSam as he looks down at the piece of paper in his hand. \nINSERT: \nA sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girl's red felt-tip cursive and the words: \nWrite to me. \nCUT TO: \nThe present. Sam and Suzy face each other in the wide meadow. Sam says carefully: \nSAM Were you followed? \nSUZY (LOOKING AROUND) I doubt it. \nSAM Good. \nSam frowns and squints. He points. \n", "test1_id": 2325, "test2_input": "Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the \"Coping with the Very Troubled Child\" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy. Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the verge of tears: \nMRS. BISHOP Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for you? \nSuzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as SHE SAYS: \nSUZY We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? \nMrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily: \nMRS. BISHOP Oh, my God. How are we going to get these fish-hooks out? \nINT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT \nCaptain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette. He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says without looking up: \nSAM I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us. \nCaptain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says SERIOUSLY: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying -- but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old. \nCaptain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits down. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can. \nCaptain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to Sam. \nCAPTAIN SHARP You want a slug? \nSam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp asks gently and sincerely: \nCAPTAIN SHARP What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean. \nSAM (SHRUGS) Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (DEFENSIVE) What does that have to do with it? So are you. \nSAM (SADLY) That's true. Did you love someone ever? \nCAPTAIN SHARP (PAUSE) Yes, I did. \nSAM What happened? \nCAPTAIN SHARP She didn't love me back. \nSAM Ah. \nSam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say. \nSAM Thanks. \nCAPTAIN SHARP What happened? \nSAM A drunk truck driver smashed into them. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (PAINED) Good grief. \nSilence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses. \nINT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT \nScout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He says into the microphone: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Scout Master's Log. September fourth. \nScout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms together and smokes. \nThere is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward SHOUTS: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Stow it, out there! I want to hear some Z's! \n", "test2_true": "The fort sixty feet above the camp. It is still under construction. The entire troop (with the exceptions of Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting. They all wear pajamas. Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to the group and his hands on a wooden railing. \nGADGE I heard he's going to reform school. \nDELUCA I heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum. \nROOSEVELT I like his girl. \nPANAGLE She's too scruffy for me. \nNICKLEBY Supposedly, they got to third base. \nLAZY-EYE That's not true. He just felt her up. \nROOSEVELT (DEEPLY INTRIGUED) Over-shirt or under-shirt? \nSkotak slams his fist on the railing. Everyone looks startled. Skotak turns around to face the group. He says ANGRILY: \nSKOTAK Damn us. \nThe railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away. There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away from the edge. He continues: \nSKOTAK This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's (MORE) \nSKOTAK (CONT'D) emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel? \nSkotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as HE ASKS: \nSKOTAK Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye? (from the heart) Gadge? \nSkotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says WITH FEELING: \nSKOTAK He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help. Are we man enough to give that? So part of his brain doesn't get removed out of him. \nSkotak stands still. He says mysteriously: \nSKOTAK They were prepared to die for each other out there. \nSilence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other, shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing. Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak. \nDELUCA What do you need? \nSKOTAK (EXCITED) For starters? Three yards of chicken wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a bucket of wheatpaste. \nEXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nA thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its trunk. For some reason, it remains standing. Mr. Bishop sits on the ground leaning against it. He breathes heavily. The axe rests across his lap. \nA twig snaps. Mr. Bishop looks up, listening. Pause. He drinks a sip of wine. \nIn the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into the trees on the left. A moment later, one taller silhouette rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees on the right. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD. NIGHT \nCaptain Sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon. Mrs. Bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her. They smoke cigarettes. Captain Sharp says sadly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP In other words, it's over. \nMRS. BISHOP I guess so. For the moment. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Until further notice. \nMRS. BISHOP That's right. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I understand. \nMRS. BISHOP I've got to do better. For everybody. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Except me. \nMRS. BISHOP Except you. \n", "test2_id": 2326, "test3_input": "Mr. and Mrs. Bishop watching from the trap door with Scout Master Ward. Mr. Bishop's eyes widen. He turns quickly to Mrs. Bishop.

BISHOP (ABSOLUTELY) I concur. \nMRS. BISHOP (INSPIRED) Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction. \nMR. BISHOP (FROM MEMORY) No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration... \nCUT TO: \nSocial Services' face, inscrutable, as she listens. \nCUT TO: \nSam and Suzy preparing to jump. They each take a deep breath. \nSUZY On three again. \nSAM (SUDDENLY) Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or (MORE) \nSAM (CONT'D) they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy. \nSuzy looks deeply moved. She kisses Sam. A little electric zap crackles at their lips. Suzy's eyes widen. \nSUZY I think you've still got lightning in you. \nSAM Let's jump. \nSam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's voice screams from off-screen: \nCAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.) No! \nSam and Suzy recoil. Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the corner of the ledge. He shouts: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Goddammit! \nSam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Tell him! Over! \nCaptain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts: \nSOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.) Captain Sharp is offering to assume the responsibility of foster parenthood! \nCUT TO: \nScout Master Ward watching from the trap door with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. He says excitedly into his walkie-talkie: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD He wants you to live with him! \nCUT TO: \nSocial Services watching from an attic window. She says softly into her own walkie-talkie: \nSOCIAL SERVICES Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky? \nCUT TO: \nSam staring at Captain Sharp. Captain Sharp says hopefully: \nCAPTAIN SHARP What do you think, pal? \nTears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy. She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie: \nCAPTAIN SHARP We're coming down! Over and out. \nCUT TO: \nInside the church. The congregation listens on another walkie- talkie. They are all just about to burst into a cheer -- when there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion. The lights go out again. Everyone screams. \nEXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT \n", "test3_true": "CAPTAIN SHARP Don't let go. \nCUT TO: \nThree days later. The detached steeple of the church lies on its side on the roof of a smashed Volkswagen. The ground is covered with strewn branches and trash. Sandbags still surround the building. The narrator stands in front of the wreckage and addresses the camera: \nNARRATOR The Black Beacon storm was considered by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather to be the region's most destructive (MORE) \nNARRATOR (CONT'D) meteorological event of the second half of the twentieth century. \nEXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY \nA basketball backboard sticks up out of nine feet of standing water. The net grazes the surface. The narrator sits in a rowboat floating alongside it. \nNARRATOR It lingered through six high-tides and inundated the islands with punishing winds and extreme high waters. \nEXT. PUBLIC BEACH. DAY \nAn enormous neon ace-of-spades with the word Open spelled in broken light-bulbs above it is jammed sideways into a sandy beach. Brightly painted wooden planks are littered everywhere. The black lighthouse remains intact in the background. The narrator, now tiny in the frame, continues: \nNARRATOR On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk and demolished the village bandstand and casino. \nEXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY \nOne week later. A repaired Camp Ivanhoe sign is being hoisted up into place above the entrance. Scouts throughout the camp hammer, chop, nail, and saw. \nINSERT: \nScout Master Ward's portable night stand. The reel-to-reel tape recorder is recording. The photograph of the Scout Master-in-Chief at the Matterhorn has been replaced by a picture of Becky operating her switchboard. \nINT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. DAY \nScout Master Ward says into the microphone: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Scout Master's log. October tenth. Reconstruction continues increasingly ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a particularly robust esprit de corps among the troop. The latrine, however, continues to present -- \nScout Master Ward notices Skotak and a young boy with glasses standing in the doorway. He says, off-mic: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Is this the new recruit? \nSKOTAK Yes, sir. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD What's his rank? \nSKOTAK He doesn't have one. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Pigeon Scout! Let's get you a patch. \nScout Master Ward presses stop on his tape recorder and leads Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator CONTINUES: \nNARRATOR The coastal areas of New Penzance were battered and changed forever. \nINSERT: \nThe narrator's nautical chart. The cove is no longer identified. \nNARRATOR (V.O.) Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the map. \nEXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY \nOne year later. The sky is blue. Wildflowers grow in the tall grass. The narrator, now in shirtsleeves, concludes: \nNARRATOR But harvest yields the following autumn far exceeded any previously recorded, and the quality of the crops was said to be extraordinary. \nThe narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera -- then turns away and walks down the hillside. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY \nThe landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning.

Now he puts it back together again in a fugue. \n", "test3_id": 2327}

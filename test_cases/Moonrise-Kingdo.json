{"train": "MOONRISE KINGDOM \nWritten by \nWes Anderson & Roman Coppola \nMay 1, 2011 \nINT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY \nA landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner. \nOutside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters. \nA ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove. \nA child's voice says over the speaker: \nRECORD PLAYER (V.O.) In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra. \nAs Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. \nThe first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten. \nThe boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. \nSuzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. \nSuzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out into the rain. \nEXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY \nA rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window, watching. \nTITLES OVER: \nThe family stuck indoors all day out of the rain. \nIn bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen. \nIn half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs. Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair, topless, in the kitchen sink. \nIn windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field. She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry. \nIn the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds. \nCUT TO: \nThe edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass. A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the narrator. He speaks to the camera: \nNARRATOR This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time. \nEXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY \nA clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye. \nA thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward. He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side. He is Gadge. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Morning, Gadge. \nGADGE Morning, sir. \nGadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army-shovel. He is Deluca. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Deluca. Latrine inspection. \nDeluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Good. \nGadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Why the hell doesn't it say that in the register? Excuse my language. \nScout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr. Billingsley shrugs. \nMR. BILLINGSLEY I don't know. What register? \nINSERT: \nThe manila file-card. It is labelled Khaki Scout Register. Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line. There is an address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing in a sunny tobacco field. He wears his scout uniform with a Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap. \nMR. BILLINGSLEY We sent him a letter. It should reach you presently. \nScout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters. He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it. Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? Well, I don't understand how that works. (TOTALLY CONFUSED) What am I supposed to do with him? \nMR. BILLINGSLEY That's up to Social Services. They'll be in touch with you. They'll look after Sam. Good luck to you. \nMr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward. Silence. \nBecky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies. Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks very impressed. \nEXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY \nScout Master Ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled troop. The scouts are equipped for hiking with back-packs and walking-sticks. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD You have your orders. Use the orienteering and path-finding skills you've been practicing all summer. Let's find our man and bring him safely back to camp. Remember: this isn't just a search party, it's a chance to do some first- class scouting. Any questions? \nLazy-Eye raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Lazy-Eye. \nLAZY-EYE What's your real job, sir? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (CAUGHT OFF-GUARD) I'm a math teacher. \nLAZY-EYE What grade? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (STIFFENING) Eighth. Why? \nLazy-Eye shrugs. Scout Master Ward frowns. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD You know, we're, actually, kind of, in the middle of something, if you didn't notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else? \nRedford raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Redford. \nREDFORD What if he resists? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (HESITATES) Who? \nREDFORD Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on him? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (IRRITATED) No, you're not. This is a non-violent rescue effort. Your instructions are to find him, not to hurt him. Under any circumstances. Do I make myself understood? \nThe scouts murmur their understanding. Scout Master Ward nods. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Good. \nPause. Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD I'm going to change my answer, in fact. This is my real job. Scout Master, Troop 55. That's us. I'm proud of that. \nThe scouts look impressed but slightly lost. Scout Master Ward says finally: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Be leery out there. OK, let's get started. Where's Snoopy? \nSKOTAK Right here. \nSkotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier. Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out of a paper sack. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Give him the scent. \nEXT. RIVER BANK. DAY \nAn eddy under a willow tree. The end of the canoe is tied to a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore. Sam covers the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine- needles. \nEXT. ROCKY GORGE. DAY \nSam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the bottom. He wears a compass on a string around his neck. \nCUT TO: \nA binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide meadow. The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves. He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction and then back the other while he stares at the dial. He looks up again. He walks onward. He stops. \nEXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY \nSuzy lowers her binoculars. She stands at the end of a path cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips part. Sam comes onto the path. He stops ten feet away from Suzy. \nSam and Suzy stare at each other. Silence. (NOTE: Suzy is slightly taller than Sam.) \nINSERT: \nA poster box with St. Jack's Church across the top. A purple- ink mimeographed page is stapled to a bulletin board inside under the heading Summer Pageant, 1964. It reads: \nBENJAMIN BRITTEN'S \"NOYE'S FLUDDE\" Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance \nCUT TO: \nDusk. A brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the bay. It is overgrown with ivy and wisteria. There is a cemetery with a low wrought-iron fence. An organ plays inside. \nTITLE: \nOne Year Earlier \nINT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. EVENING \nA play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised. \nKhaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle. He looks bored. \nA baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform watches him from the end of the pew, frowning. \nCUT TO: \nSam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that \nwinds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large woman stares through a small window into the church with her hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent. Pause. \nMrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to wait. \nSam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING \nSam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks THROUGH AT: \nFive eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls turn around quickly, covering themselves. \nSam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy: \nSAM What kind of bird are you? \nSuzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says in a bossy voice: \nBOSSY GIRL I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and -- \nSam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing: \nSAM No, I said, \"What kind of bird are you?\" \nThe other girls all look to Suzy. Pause. \nSUZY I'm a raven. \nSuzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl frowns. \nSAM Did you bring a cat? \nSuzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer. \nSAM Can you read a map? \nSUZY Uh-huh. \nSAM I do cartography. \nSam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map. \nSAM I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes. \nSUZY OK. \nSAM (pointing on the map) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred (which means four o'clock). How does that sound? \nSUZY Fine. \nSAM You want some beef jerky? \nSUZY OK. \nSam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to Suzy. She tries to chew on it. Sam nods: \nSAM Let's go. \nMONTAGE: \nSam and Suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and through a wooded path eating beef jerky. They both smile continuously. \nSAM Are you thirsty? \nSUZY No. \nSAM Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly. \nSam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap. \nSAM Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down. \nSUZY That's a good idea. It might help also if you didn't wear fur. \nSAM (HESITATES) True, but this adds camouflage. \nSam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. He holds it in his fist. \nSAM Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing. \nSam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy squints. \nSUZY Which way? \nSAM Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks. \nSam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush with purple fruit. Sam looks skeptical. \nSAM These might be poisonous. \nSUZY (STUDYING THEM) No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try one. \nSuzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. Sam puts one into his mouth and nods. \nSAM Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival. \nSam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers: \nSUZY He knows someone's watching him. \nSAM I agree. Why do you say that? \nSUZY (SQUINTING) I don't know. I just think he can feel us. \nEXT. LAKE SHORE. DUSK \nSam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a small camp-fire circled with rocks. He cooks two fish with bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire. He throws in a dash of salt, grinds some pepper, and flips the fish in the air. He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log next to him. She tastes it. She looks surprised and nods ENTHUSIASTICALLY: \nSUZY Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you? \nSAM (STIFFENING) I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for. \nSam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has fried eggs and bacon on it. \nSAM Anyway, I used to be. \nSam serves the fish onto two tin plates. He says as they eat with folding forks: \nSAM We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs. \nSam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper. Suzy frowns. \nSUZY That's OK. He only eats cat food. \nSuzy points to a cardboard box. Sam looks inside. It is filled with ten cans of cat food. Sam raises an eyebrow. \nSAM What else did you bring? We should make an inventory. \nSUZY OK. \nSam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. \nSAM Go ahead. \nSuzy opens the top of her portable record player. She displays it like a salesman. \nSUZY This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music? \nSam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder. There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a French singer. \nSUZY This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France. \nSam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books. It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing). \nSUZY These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want. \nSam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more ITEMS: \nSUZY I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb. \nSam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches his head. \nSAM That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter? \nSUZY (FROWNS) I thought that's what you're supposed to bring. I don't own a canteen. \nPause. Sam shrugs. He smiles. \nSAM That's OK. We can share. \nSam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young, alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly puzzled. \nSAM These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue. \nSam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks BLUNTLY: \nSAM Do you steal? \nSilence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused. \nSAM Why? You're not poor. \nSuzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally: \nSUZY I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes. \nSam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He SAYS SERIOUSLY: \nINSERT: \nA short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip cursive. It reads: \nDear Lionel, I need to use your record player. I will give it back in ten days or less. Do not tell Mom. (Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop \nMrs. Bishop frowns. She bolts back out of the room. Her voice BOOMS AGAIN: \nMRS. BISHOP (O.S.) Walt! Where the hell are you? \nThere is a loud thump upstairs. Mr. Bishop shouts from OUTSIDE: \nMR. BISHOP (O.S.) Right here! Why are you cursing at me? \nCUT TO: \nExterior. Mr. Bishop leans out of an upstairs window. Mrs. Bishop appears in one below. She yells up through the MEGAPHONE: \nMRS. BISHOP Does it concern you that your daughter's just run away from home? \nMR. BISHOP (PAUSE) That's a loaded question. \nMrs. Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand. \nMRS. BISHOP Come down and read this. \nA radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker: \nBECKY (V.O.) Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no luck. They're going home for the -- \nThere is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening -- then the radio cuts off. Mr. Bishop frowns. He shouts: \nMR. BISHOP Who's there? \nCaptain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was JUST -- \nMR. BISHOP (ANGRILY) What are you doing here? Nobody called the police. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I know, that's what I'm saying. The search party's not over yet. In other WORDS -- \nMRS. BISHOP Suzy's missing, too! Go find her. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (HESITATES) OK. Where'd she -- \nMR. BISHOP Wait for me. \nMr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop exchange an uncertain look. \nINT. STATION WAGON. NIGHT \nCaptain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the darkness while he steers the car. The lamp has a short in it \nand flickers with each bump. Mr. Bishop rides in the passenger seat. He stares ahead down the road and says to HIMSELF: \nMR. BISHOP How can we help her? She's got so many problems. It's getting worse. \nMr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks: \nMR. BISHOP Whose fault is it? \nCAPTAIN SHARP (HESITATES) I don't know, but just for the record: ninety-five percent of all runaways return home within six hours. That doesn't do you any good right now. It's just a statistic -- but in all likelihood Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment, as we speak. \nMR. BISHOP She doesn't have any friends. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (LONG PAUSE) How's Laura? \nMR. BISHOP (IRRITATED) How's Laura? \nCAPTAIN SHARP Mrs. Bishop, I mean. \nMR. BISHOP I don't understand. \nSAM (V.O.) Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you. That is more important. If they -- \nSuzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in their hands. \nSUZY (V.O.) Dear Sam, I do think you should think of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad. It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves. Can you -- \nSam writes in his bunk crouched beneath a blanket with a Khaki Scout flashlight pointed at his paper. \nSAM (V.O.) Dear Suzy, Here is my plan. \nSuzy writes in her bed crouched beneath a quilt with a plastic lantern glowing beside her. \nSUZY (V.O.) Dear Sam, My answer is yes. \nINSERT: \nA sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's PENCILED SCRAWL: \nSAM (V.O.) Dear Suzy, When? \nINSERT: \nA sheet of pink stationary which reads in a girl's red felt- TIP CURSIVE: \nSUZY (V.O.) Dear Sam, Where? \nCUT TO: \nSuzy kneeling in the dark, crouched in front of an upper window with the shoebox of letters beside her. Outside, the woods are black beyond a moonlit field. \nSAM (V.O.) Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it. Turn right and follow to the end. \nSuzy raises her binoculars to her eyes. \nSAM (V.O.) I will meet you in the meadow. \nEXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY \nThe next morning. The end of the path cut through the high grass where Sam and Suzy met the day before. Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, Mrs. Bishop, and Becky stand in two groups talking. Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash. Other scouts search the field and scan the horizon. \nCaptain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are parked in the dirt. \nMr. Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the ground with a stick. He has two black eyes, and half his face is swollen and purple. Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD What happened to him? \nBECKY I'm not sure. I think he went searching in the dark. \nMr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground: \nMR. BISHOP She stole the batteries out of my flashlight. \nScout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces. Becky raises an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers quickly, almost inaudibly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I think he's onto us. \nMRS. BISHOP (INSTANTLY) Of course, he is. \nCaptain Sharp looks surprised and defensive. He whispers BACK: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Of course, he is? \nMRS. BISHOP Of course, he is. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (CONFUSED) Why aren't we worried about that, then? \nMRS. BISHOP I am. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (ASTONISHED) Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I thought I was wrong. Did you hit him? \nMRS. BISHOP No. He fell in a ditch. \nNickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an empty can of cat food into the air. He shouts excitedly: \nSUZY (COLDLY) Maybe you just don't know him. \nREDFORD We know him a lot better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up. \nNickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed and ready. Suzy looks furious. Sam flips his air-rifle off his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly: \nSAM Do not cross this stick. \nSam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. Silence. \nREDFORD You're doomed, Shakusky. \nRedford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the clearing toward Sam and Suzy. The rest of the troop converges, yelling crazily. \nCUT TO: \nThe wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small explosion. One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill. Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and clutching his side. \nCUT TO: \nRedford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering in the branches of a tree. \nSuzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back to Suzy. He says gently: \nSAM It was him or us. \nSuzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen. \nSUZY Oh, no. \nSuzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the kitten away, and says bleakly: \nSAM They got Snoopy through the neck. \nSuzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as SHE SAYS: \nSUZY He needs a doctor. \nSam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He SAYS SADLY: \nSAM No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue. \nSUZY (trying to catch her breath) He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go? \nSuzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and MELODRAMA: \nSAM Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it. \nSUZY (starting to cry) Don't say that. \nSAM They're after us. We got to move. \nSUZY (raising her voice) He's dying! We can't just leave him! \nSAM (SHOUTING) It's too late! He's already gone! \nSUZY (SCREAMING) Stop yelling at me! \nSam slaps Suzy in the face. She falls silent. He says slowly: \nSAM I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never -- \nSuzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him. \nSUZY Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me. \nSam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly: \nSUZY You're right. He's dead. \nSam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully: \nSUZY Was he a good dog? \nScout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD I'm trying. \nMr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Stop. \nMr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him backwards and shouts: \nMRS. BISHOP Stop it, Walt! \nMr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge, Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside the seaplane. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I do blame him -- (pointing to Scout Master Ward) -- but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people. \nMRS. BISHOP (HESITATES) What are you talking about? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look. \nScout Master Ward shows Mrs. Bishop the blood all over his hands and uniform. Mrs. Bishop looks confused. \nMRS. BISHOP I don't get it. Were there witnesses? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Of course. It's assault. \nMRS. BISHOP I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD No, ma'am, but -- \nMRS. BISHOP (FURIOUS) Well, I am! \nCaptain Sharp gently draws Mrs. Bishop away by the shoulder. He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Easy does it. Calm down, Laura. \nMR. BISHOP Stay away from my wife. \nMr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop. They shout REPEATEDLY: \nCAPTAIN SHARP/MR. BISHOP SCOUT MASTER WARD/MRS. BISHOP Dammit! Christ! Shit! Jesus! \nAt this moment, a voice interjects from the shore: \nNARRATOR (O.S.) Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain Sharp? \nCaptain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stop fighting and turn around at once. They see: the narrator. He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal with rubber bands wrapped around it. They all stare at him blankly. He continues: \nNARRATOR As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. \nLong pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He yells over the noise: \nNARRATOR What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. \nThe narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal. \nINSERT: \nA carefully hand-drafted nautical chart. A cove is marked with a red arrow and the caption Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. \nINSERT: \nThe portable record player. Suzy's fingers place the needle onto a spinning disc. \nEXT. TIDAL LAGOON. DAY \nA small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff. It forms an almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers, and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from tree to tree. \nSam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker: \nRECORD PLAYER (V.O.) Onto the bird-house, where every kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around. This is a real acrobatic act for our gifted young flute player, Paula Robeson. \nAs they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove. They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts, SMILING: \nSAM Why do you always use binoculars? \nSuzy thinks for minute. She says finally: \nSUZY It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power. \nSAM (IMPRESSED) That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. They're just supposed to be creative. \nSuzy gives Sam the binoculars. He points them at her and stares. \nSAM What do you want to be? When you grow up. \nSUZY I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you? \nSAM (PAUSE) Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck, too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm just repeating what you just said, but I couldn't think of anything as good as it. On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the exact future. \nSUZY That's true. \nSAM It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean. \nSUZY (SURPRISED) OK. \nSAM (RELUCTANTLY) I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended. \nSUZY (SOFTLY) Of course, I won't. \nSAM Some people frown on these problems. \nSuzy nods. She holds Sam's hand. She points to the scorpion brooch pinned to Sam's shirt. \nSUZY What's that one for? \nSam looks at the brooch. He shakes his head. \nSAM It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn. \nSuzy nods thoughtfully. Pause. \nSUZY Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much. \nSAM I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one. \nSUZY I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special. \nSam frowns. Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes. He shakes his head. \nSAM I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. \nLong pause. Suzy says genuinely: \nSUZY I love you, too. \nCUT TO: \nA campfire burns in front of the tent. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called The Light of Seven Matchsticks. There is an illustration on the cover of a child's hand extinguishing a little flame. A ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers. \nSUZY The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. \"It's windy,\" he said. \"Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers.\" Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people crazy. \nSuzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam nods and signals for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads ON: \nSUZY Part Two. \nOMIT \nCUT TO: \nThe next morning. Sam and Suzy are asleep with their arms wrapped around each other inside the tent. They wear only their underwear. The sound of an airplane approaches. Sam's eyes open. The noise buzzes by loudly overhead. Suzy sits up. Sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and looks out. Suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg. THEY SEE: \nCaptain Sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away. Scout Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy- Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr. Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St. Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further away. Men in red caps stand on their decks. \nSuzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers: \nMR. BISHOP Suzy! Get out here! \nSUZY I wish I knew what makes you tick. \nMR. BISHOP (HESITATES) I beg your pardon? \nMRS. BISHOP Please, terminate this conversation. \nMR. BISHOP (TO LIONEL) She's saying that to me? \nLionel shakes his head bitterly. Suzy stares out to sea. Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door, and goes inside. \nINT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY \nA small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly, pausing between each sentence: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your situation. It's not on the register. How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time for an inspection back there. On the beach. I would've given you a \"commendable\". That was one of the best- pitched camp-sites I've ever seen. Honestly. \nSam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded VOICE: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD You don't want to be a Khaki Scout anymore? \nSam shakes his head. \nINT. POST OFFICE. DAY \nBecky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on. Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing their own sets of head-phones. There is a click on the other end of the line. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Hello, Becky. \nBECKY Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Go ahead, New Penzance. \nCUT TO: \nSplit-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss- cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor behind her. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Hello? This is Captain Sharp. \nSocial Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball- point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She says into her telephone: \nSOCIAL SERVICES Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody. \nCAPTAIN SHARP That's correct. \nSOCIAL SERVICES What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind? \nCAPTAIN SHARP He's OK. \nSOCIAL SERVICES Very good. How do I get to you? \nCAPTAIN SHARP The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail. \nSOCIAL SERVICES I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to (MORE) \nSOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd) provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time? \nCAPTAIN SHARP Uh-huh. \nSOCIAL SERVICES Is that a yes? \nCAPTAIN SHARP Uh-huh. \nSOCIAL SERVICES Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day. \nSocial Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain Sharp says abruptly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Wait a second. \nSOCIAL SERVICES (HESITATES) Yes? \nCAPTAIN SHARP Social Services? \nSOCIAL SERVICES (EVENLY) Captain Sharp. \nMrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the \"Coping with the Very Troubled Child\" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy. Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the verge of tears: \nMRS. BISHOP Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for you? \nSuzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as SHE SAYS: \nSUZY We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? \nMrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily: \nMRS. BISHOP Oh, my God. How are we going to get these fish-hooks out? \nINT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT \nCaptain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette. He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says without looking up: \nSAM I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us. \nCaptain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says SERIOUSLY: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying -- but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old. \nCaptain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits down. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can. \nCaptain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to Sam. \nCAPTAIN SHARP You want a slug? \nSam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp asks gently and sincerely: \nCAPTAIN SHARP What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean. \nSAM (SHRUGS) Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (DEFENSIVE) What does that have to do with it? So are you. \nSAM (SADLY) That's true. Did you love someone ever? \nCAPTAIN SHARP (PAUSE) Yes, I did. \nSAM What happened? \nCAPTAIN SHARP She didn't love me back. \nSAM Ah. \nSam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say. \nSAM Thanks. \nCAPTAIN SHARP What happened? \nSAM A drunk truck driver smashed into them. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (PAINED) Good grief. \nSilence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses. \nINT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT \nScout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He says into the microphone: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Scout Master's Log. September fourth. \nScout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms together and smokes. \nThere is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward SHOUTS: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Stow it, out there! I want to hear some Z's! \nINSERT: \nThe first page. There is another drawing of the Scout Master- in-Chief. This time he is behind the wheel of a ship. His signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large text: \"Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.\" \nPause. Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine. He looks around, confused. Something dawns on him. \nINT. COMMAND TENT. DAY \nA small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly. \nEXT. COMMAND TENT. DAY \nA triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem pole looming over it. It stands on five-foot stilts. There is a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across its side which read Regional Jubilee. \nA forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his chest is sharpening a straight razor. He is Secretary McIntire. He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a barber's chair. \nThe young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying a strip of paper. He hands it to Secretary McIntire. Secretary McIntire stares at it. He says to the man under the TOWEL: \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE You're not going to believe this one, sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance? Has now lost his entire troop. \nThe seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo? \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE (VAGUELY) I couldn't say. \nCommander Pierce shakes his head. He continues to study the document as he sits back down. Secretary McIntire begins to lather his cheeks with a brush. \nCUT TO: \nA vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction. Fort Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks. A large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North America. A bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato tattoo. It echoes for miles. \nSam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak. They shiver. Sam has on his back-pack. Suzy carries her suitcase. Gadge holds a tennis ball can. \nA scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he walks by. He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy. He says to Nickleby: \nGUARD SCOUT Who's your unit leader? \nPause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking hamburgers on a grill. \nNICKLEBY That guy. \nThe scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says FURTIVELY: \nSKOTAK There's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent. \nSkotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy, and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths. Skotak motions for everyone to follow him. \nA footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food, drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old \nscout with a pencil behind his ear. He is Cousin Ben. He says to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki: \nCOUSIN BEN I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake-bite kit? Get some money. \nSkotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin Ben nods. He says to his customers: \nCOUSIN BEN Come back in five minutes. \nCousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter. \nEXT. WOODEN PROMENADE. DAY \nSam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs. As they talk, they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped by color in the fields below. They walk past towers, huts, ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction. They walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a doctor taking a boy's blood pressure. They walk past a fleet of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners. Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk, cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in spite of the fierce winds. One group rides motorcycles, another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a cable-trolley. \nCousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of THE WIND: \nCOUSIN BEN Is this him? \nSAM Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned. \nCOUSIN BEN He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the can? \nSKOTAK Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in nickels. \nCousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can. He jerks his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively: \nCOUSIN BEN I guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least -- \nSKOTAK Woah! \nCousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She says to Cousin Ben: \nSUZY We're sure. \nCOUSIN BEN OK. Let's do a blood test. \nINT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY \nCousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar. He wears a purple, silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it. Sam \nand Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it. Skotak and the rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a MANUAL: \nCOUSIN BEN -- which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965. (LOOKING UP) That's the end of the short-form. Do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks? Usually, they don't. \nSkotak raises his hand. Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him: \nCOUSIN BEN Skotak. \nSKOTAK Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future. \nCOUSIN BEN (OFFENDED) That's my fee. \nSkotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned. They murmur to each other: \nNICKLEBY What's going to happen to them? \nGADGE Nobody knows. \nDELUCA Let's take a vote. \nSKOTAK All in favor -- \nCOUSIN BEN (LOUDLY) That's my fee. \nSkotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben. Cousin Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak. \nCOUSIN BEN You're just like your brothers. OK, give them the tennis ball can. \nCousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of \nSam's back-pack. Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a clipboard. \nCOUSIN BEN Sign here -- and initial here and here. \nSam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy. \nCOUSIN BEN Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's go. \nSam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces. Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as a group through the camp. \nOMIT \nEXT. CAMP MARINA. DAY \nSam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the sail. \nSam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone looks choked up. \nCousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet. Pause. \nNICKLEBY Where they going again? \nGADGE He's going to work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly. \nSKOTAK (WISTFULLY) I wish them well. \nLAZY-EYE Me, too. Me, too. \nA name-tag that reads Scout Master Ward next to a patch with a picture of a snow-capped mountain. It says K.S.N.A. Leadership underneath. \nCommander Pierce says bitterly: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE I'm field-stripping you of your command. \nCommander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's uniform and throws it aside. He holds out his hand, palm up. Scout Master Ward looks stricken. He reaches into his pocket, takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander Pierce. Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket. He SHOUTS: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE Attention, company! Prepare for emergency evacuation! \nSecretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce. He WHISPERS DISCREETLY: \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE Sir, do you have your medicine? \nCommander Pierce hesitates. He holds up a finger. \nCOMMANDER PIERCE I'll be right back. \nCommander Pierce strides back into the command tent. Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy. Scout Master Ward stares down at the ground. \nThe flash-flood explodes out from the woods. \nGushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its narrow path. The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island at the center of a rushing river. \nThe company is taken aback. Scout Master Ward stiffens, watchful. The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside, something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into flames. \nSecretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still, watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout Master Ward makes a snap decision. He turns to the company AND SHOUTS: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Hold your position! \nScout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood, wades through it against the current, dodging branches and debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and walks balancing on it to the burning tent. He disappears inside. \nSecretary McIntire and the vast company watch, riveted. \nScout Master Ward comes out the opposite side of the tent onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying Commander Pierce over his shoulders. He descends back into the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the embankment. The company looks deeply, permanently impressed. Scout Master Ward hollers: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Company Secretary! Status report, sir! \nSecretary McIntire hesitates. He stirs to attention and says ENTHUSIASTICALLY: \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE All accounted for, Scout Master! \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Supply and Resources! Call it out! \nCousin Ben gives an A-OK sign near the front of the assembly. HE SHOUTS: \nCOUSIN BEN Affirmative, sir! \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Fall in! We're going to run for it, boys! Let's move! \nThe entire company follows Scout Master Ward with Commander Pierce over his shoulders at a fast jog out of the camp. \nINT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. DAY \nThe room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee center. Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls outside the doors and windows. The rain beats on the roof, and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass. \nA side door opens. Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old fishermen follow closely behind them. They slam the door. Captain Sharp looks around frantically. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Who's in charge here? \nAnother side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp yells to him: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Randy! What happened? \nScout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his back to him, jogging in place. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Take the commander off of me. \nCaptain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master Ward's back and into a pew to rest. Secretary McIntire assists them. Mr. Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the left and right: \nMR. BISHOP Suzy? Sam? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (shaking his head) They ran away again. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (HORRIFIED) Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail. \nSilence. In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's walking stick weapon off the floor. He stares at it, puzzled. Social Services says carefully: \nSOCIAL SERVICES Just find the boy -- and deliver him -- (motioning to herself) -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power. \nMR. BISHOP (SHARPLY) I'm sorry. \nSocial Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop looks tense. \nMR. BISHOP Can we get back to the rescue now? \nMRS. BISHOP (URGENTLY) Suzy's still out there. \nSOCIAL SERVICES (FROWNING) Who are you? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's the missing girl. \nSOCIAL SERVICES The parents of the stabber? \nMRS. BISHOP I object to that description. She was attacked. \nCommander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face. He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE I want the details. Where's the scout she knifed? \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE Right here. \nSecretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal. Redford appears. \nREDFORD Field Mate Redford, sir. \nCOMMANDER PIERCE (through the oxygen mask) What's his condition? \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE He may suffer some limited chronic kidney insufficiency. Here's the report. \nSecretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report. Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder. \nMRS. BISHOP We don't have time for this! \nSCOUT MASTER WARD She's right! \nSOCIAL SERVICES Let's go! \nSocial Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing Panagle's walking stick weapon. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Nobody's going anywhere. \nEveryone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social Services. He says in a steely voice: \nCAPTAIN SHARP He's not getting shock therapy. \nSocial Services looks furious. Her jaw sets. She reaches inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation Book. \nSOCIAL SERVICES That's it! I'm citing you for gross misconduct! You are hereby summoned to appear before the board of -- \nCaptain Sharp looks enraged. He grits his teeth. He reaches into his back pocket and withdraws a similar pad labelled Boating Violations. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I'm writing you up back! Be notified that you stand accused of the mistreatment and IMPROPER -- \nSOCIAL SERVICES (SCREAMING) What are you talking about? \nCAPTAIN SHARP (SCREAMING) I won't let you do it! \nREDFORD (SCREAMING) Look! \nEveryone looks. Redford is standing on a pew with his arm stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. The troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty. \nThere is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go out at once. People gasp. Candles flicker alight on candlesticks. A back-up generator kicks into gear, humming, and the room fills with a new, different light. \nCaptain Sharp says to himself: \nCAPTAIN SHARP They're gone. \nMr. and Mrs. Bishop watching from the trap door with Scout Master Ward. Mr. Bishop's eyes widen. He turns quickly to Mrs. Bishop. She nods, energized. Mr. Bishop grabs Scout Master Ward's walkie-talkie and shouts forcefully: \nMR. BISHOP In this state? I would litigate with extreme confidence. \nMRS. BISHOP (ABSOLUTELY) I concur. \nMRS. BISHOP (INSPIRED) Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction. \nMR. BISHOP (FROM MEMORY) No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration... \nCUT TO: \nSocial Services' face, inscrutable, as she listens. \nCUT TO: \nSam and Suzy preparing to jump. They each take a deep breath. \nSUZY On three again. \nSAM (SUDDENLY) Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or (MORE) \nSAM (CONT'D) they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy. \nSuzy looks deeply moved. She kisses Sam. A little electric zap crackles at their lips. Suzy's eyes widen. \nSUZY I think you've still got lightning in you. \nSAM Let's jump. \nSam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's voice screams from off-screen: \nCAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.) No! \nSam and Suzy recoil. Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the corner of the ledge. He shouts: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Goddammit! \nSam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Tell him! Over! \nCaptain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts: \nSOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.) Captain Sharp is offering to assume the responsibility of foster parenthood! \nCUT TO: \nScout Master Ward watching from the trap door with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. He says excitedly into his walkie-talkie: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD He wants you to live with him! \nCUT TO: \nSocial Services watching from an attic window. She says softly into her own walkie-talkie: \nSOCIAL SERVICES Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky? \nCUT TO: \nSam staring at Captain Sharp. Captain Sharp says hopefully: \nCAPTAIN SHARP What do you think, pal? \nTears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy. She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie: \nCAPTAIN SHARP We're coming down! Over and out. \nCUT TO: \nInside the church. The congregation listens on another walkie- talkie. They are all just about to burst into a cheer -- when there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion. The lights go out again. Everyone screams. \nEXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT \n", "test1_input": "Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Who's missing? \nScout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names, scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Shakusky! Breakfast! \nSilence. Scout Master Ward calls to Lazy-Eye: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Lazy-Eye. \nLazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence. \nScout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed \nat the front. Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his hips and says: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Shakusky? You in there? \nScout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps. He frowns. He says to Gadge: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD It's zipped from the inside. \nThe other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat. Scout Master Ward's voice softens: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Sam? \nScout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden- handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up briskly, unzipping the tent. \nINT. SCOUT TENT. DAY \nThe lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it, and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside. \nThere is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout Master Ward looks to his staring troop. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop. \nEXT. POLICE STATION. DAY \nA one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island Police. There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small \nharbor. There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs in the rough tide. \nA silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby. \nA six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain Sharp. \nTwo grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands up briskly and says to one of the old men: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Watch my line, Edgar. \nINT. POLICE STATION. DAY \nA small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way radio. Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with his thumb. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over. \nScout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe. Over. \nCaptain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a hot-plate as he answers distractedly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? Over. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over. \nSilence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly. \nCAPTAIN SHARP What does that mean? Over. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug- out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds (MORE) \n", "test1_true": "Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he contemplates this. He says finally: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Any idea why? Over. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) No. He left me a letter of resignation. Over. \nINSERT: \nA sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's PENCILED SCRAWL: \nDear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad to inform you I can no longer be involved with the Khaki Scouts of North America. The rest of the troop will probably be glad to hear this. It is not your fault. Best wishes, Sam Shakusky. \nCaptain Sharp scratches his head. He checks his watch. Pause. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I guess we better notify his folks. Over. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) OK. Over and out. \nEXT. POST OFFICE. DAY \nA clapboard cottage surrounded by a white, picket fence. A sign on the door reads U.S. Mail. Captain's Sharp station wagon is parked in the background. \nINT. POST OFFICE. DAY \nA young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper. She is Becky. She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone attached. Captain Sharp paces behind her. Scout Master Ward flips through a stack of letters and post cards. \nA bell rings on the switchboard. Becky plugs cords into sockets. \nBECKY Hello, Diane. \nOPERATOR (V.O.) Becky, I have your person-to-person from Chesterfield. \nBECKY Hold the line, please. \nBecky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head- phones. \nBECKY Go ahead, Chesterfield. \nCUT TO: \nSplit-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a white-haired woman ices a cake in the background. They are Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley says into his TELEPHONE: \nMR. BILLINGSLEY Hello? \nCAPTAIN SHARP Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp. \nMR. BILLINGSLEY Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank you very much. In fact, we've come to a decision, as a family, because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't invite him back, at this time. \nCaptain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled. Captain Sharp says evenly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on. \nMR. BILLINGSLEY I understand that. I'm notifying you of the situation on my end. \nCAPTAIN SHARP I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back? \nMR. BILLINGSLEY I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got a good heart, but it's just not fair to the others, you see? He's emotionally disturbed. \nLong pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her cake. Captain Sharp says finally: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Am I speaking to Sam's father? \nMr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised: \nMR. BILLINGSLEY No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's been with us since last June. \nMrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr. Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward speaking. Are you implying Sam's an orphan? \nMR. BILLINGSLEY Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he is. \n", "test1_id": 2325, "test2_input": "CAPTAIN SHARP (SINCERELY) Well, I hope you can. I think you will. You're doing the right thing. \nPause. Captain Sharp suddenly slides his hand inside Mrs. Bishop's shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her -- then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the engine. Mrs. Bishop hesitates. She reaches inside the window and puts her hand on the top of Captain Sharp's head. She says, worried: \nMRS. BISHOP Who know what's going to happen, Duffy? I'll probably see you tomorrow. \nCAPTAIN SHARP (CALMLY) No, you won't. \nSilence. The motor idles. Captain Sharp says distantly: \nCAPTAIN SHARP I admire them, you know? There's a purity to it. I only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people -- but maybe that's romantic. \nMRS. BISHOP (PUZZLED) I don't see it that way. \nCaptain Sharp puts the car into gear and drives off. Mrs. Bishop finishes her cigarette. She gets on her bicycle and rides away. \nINT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT \nA burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping. He has the sheet pulled up to his chin, but his toes stick out. He opens one eye. Dust descends and settles. Something scrapes and scratches. The flame burns out. \nSam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the floor. He crouches in front of the fireplace. He flicks on a scout flashlight and sees: \nThe end of a hanging rope. \nSam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up, shining his flashlight. Skotak is looking down at him from the top of the chimney. He puts his finger to his lips. Sam WHISPERS SHARPLY: \nSAM Get out of my chimney. \nSKOTAK Listen to me. We're here for friendship. We're going to get you off this island. \nSAM (LONG PAUSE) No, thanks. \nSKOTAK Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue. \nSAM It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy. \nSkotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney, smiling toothily. Sam looks ecstatic. \nSAM How'd you get here? \nSUZY They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mach\u00e9 dummy in my bed. \nSAM (IMPRESSED) Diversion tactics. Good thinking. \nCUT TO: \nThe next room. Captain Sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the floor of the kitchenette in the dark. He snores quietly. \nEXT. ROUGH CHANNEL. NIGHT \nFive mini-canoes race across a wide, choppy strait close to the open sea. Skotak, Deluca, Nickleby, Gadge, Lazy-Eye, Panagle, Roosevelt, Chef, and Izod paddle aggressively. We hear in voice-over: \nSAM (V.O.) Where we going? \nSKOTAK (V.O.) Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the Supply and Resources outpost for the Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout, Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do. \nSAM (V.O.) Can we trust him? \nSKOTAK (V.O.) Normally, I'd say no. \nSam and Suzy ride in the back of the canoe that Skotak rows. Sam has his arms around Suzy's waist. The kitten is on her shoulder. Sam sees the portable record player among Suzy's things. \nSAM Did you leave another note for Lionel? \nSUZY Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again. \nSAM That's true. \nCUT TO: \nA pebble beach below high dunes. Large waves sweep into the shore. Spray blows through the air. There is a black lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance. The narrator stands at the water's edge holding a meteorologist's measuring stick. He braces himself against the gusting winds. He speaks to the camera: \nNARRATOR This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community. \n", "test2_true": "NARRATOR The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots. (checks his watch) The time is now four thirty-five A.M. \nThe narrator walks quickly out of the shot. The five canoes land on the beach with the tide. Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the shore. \nINT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT \nThe room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside. \nLong pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers: \nMRS. BISHOP Did you file the motion for continuance? Peabody vs. Henderson. \nMR. BISHOP It was sustained. \nMRS. BISHOP Good. \nMR. BISHOP (PAUSE) Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob. \nMRS. BISHOP He granted it. \nMR. BISHOP Great. \nSilence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly: \nMRS. BISHOP I'm sorry, Walt. \nMR. BISHOP It's not your fault. Which injuries are you apologizing for? Specifically. \nMRS. BISHOP Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt. \nMR. BISHOP (WISTFULLY) Half of those were self-inflicted. \nMrs. Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her face. A powerful blast of wind shakes the room. A night-light blinks. Mr. Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says: \nMR. BISHOP I hope the roof flies off, and I get sucked up into space. You'll be better off without me. \nMRS. BISHOP (SADLY) Stop feeling sorry for yourself. \nMR. BISHOP (PAINED) Why? \nMr. and Mrs. Bishop look across at each other in the dark. Mrs. Bishop says desperately: \nMRS. BISHOP We're all they've got, Walt. \nMr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a DAWNING REALIZATION: \nMR. BISHOP It's not enough. \nINT. STONE CAVE. NIGHT \nFlashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls. Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. Gadge is tucked into a sleeping bag under a ledge. The troop nestle on rocks and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep cavern. \nSam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called Annabelle's Midnight. There is an illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her. \nSUZY \"-- but I'm not going,\" said Barnaby Jack. \"I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught.\" Annabelle whispered: \"I'm coming with you.\" Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. \"Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight.\" \nSuzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads on: \nSUZY He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow. \nEXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY \nThe next morning. Camp Ivanhoe. Scout Master Ward emerges from his tent. He puts on his hat. The wind whips it off his head. He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the chin-strap tight. He frowns. He shouts: \nSCOUT MASTER WARD No bugle? No reveille? Lazy-eye, Gadge, Deluca, Izod? Where's my troop? Let's go! You're late! \nScout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match blows out. He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill. He throws his hands into the air. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Chef? Breakfast? \nScout Master Ward shakes his head. He arrives at the picnic table and rings his bell. He sits down. He opens a new issue of Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout troop rappelling in Tasmania. He struggles to keep the rippling pages from turning by themselves. \n", "test2_id": 2326, "test3_input": "CUT TO: \nA binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence. SAM SHOUTS: \nSAM Follow me! \nSam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a sprint to the fence, climb the ladder, and pull it up after them. A bugle plays a cavalry charge. The mob bolts after them. \nCUT TO: \nSplit-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head- phones. On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the commander's entourage inside the command tent. Commander Pierce says into his field-telephone: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE Captain Sharp, we've located the missing troop. They just fled camp. We're in (MORE) \nCOMMANDER PIERCE (cont'd) pursuit. They're accompanied by a twelve- year-old girl in knee-socks and Sunday- school shoes. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Stand by, Commander Pierce. \nCaptain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on a two-way radio. He says into a microphone: \nCAPTAIN SHARP Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell Social Services the boy's been spotted at Fort Lebanon. \nJED (V.O.) Roger that. Will comply. \nCaptain Sharp sets down the microphone. He turns to Becky. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there. \nBecky nods. Captain Sharp turns to Scout Master Ward. \nCAPTAIN SHARP Randy? You monitoring? \nScout Master Ward is already on his feet. He peels off his head-phones. \nSCOUT MASTER WARD Affirmative. I'm on my way. \nBecky plugs a cord into a socket and says: \nBECKY Hello! Mr. Bishop? \nCaptain Sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread. \nINT. BISHOP HOUSE. DAY \nMr. Bishop listens on the telephone with a strained look on his face. Mrs. Bishop watches him intently. \nMR. BISHOP Oh, dear God. \nMr. Bishop grabs Mrs. Bishop by the wrist. He says grimly: \nMR. BISHOP Get the boys. \nMrs. Bishop raises her megaphone to her mouth. She shouts: \nMRS. BISHOP Let's go! Right now! \nINT. SEAPLANE. DAY \nA deHavilland Beaver in heavy rain and turbulence. Jed speaks into his radio while piloting the aircraft. Social Services sits beside him in the passenger's seat. She looks queasy but determined. \nJED Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm co- ordinates for new destination: alpha-two- two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy up here. Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over. (to Social Services) Hang on, Social Services. \nJed presses the yoke forward, and the plane dips hard. Social Services braces against the dash. \nEXT. MOTORBOAT. DAY \nScout Master Ward steers his outboard through the open channel. The boat crests high over deep swells, flooding over in waves. Scout Master Ward is drenched. He does not flinch or even appear to notice. \nEXT. FOREST PATH. DAY \nSam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop scramble through the woods as fast as they can. There are flashes of lightning and pounding thunder. Suzy trips on a root, and Sam pulls her to her feet. Sam trips on a rock, and Suzy pulls him to his feet. \nINT. COMMAND TENT. DAY \n", "test3_true": "INSERT: \nA transistor radio. The announcer says urgently: \nWEATHER MAN (V.O.) Once again: storm waters have just breached the dam at Black Beacon (MORE) \nWEATHER MAN (V.O.) (cont'd) Reservoir. A flash flood alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions. \nCommander Pierce and Secretary McIntire listen to the report. Secretary McIntire says gravely: \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE That's coming our way. \nCaptain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent. One of the team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily. Commander Pierce points to him: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE You find them? \nTEAM CAPTAIN No, sir. \nCOMMANDER PIERCE (to the entourage) Prepare to mobilize to higher ground. \nSecretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce an envelope with red-and-white stripes on it. Commander Pierce rips it open. HE READS: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE St. Jack Church is the designated storm shelter. (to Secretary McIntire) Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double. \nINSERT: \nThe St. Jack's Church poster box. Another mimeographed page is stapled to the bulletin board.

EPISCOPAL CHURCH. DAY \nThe set for the ark stands on the platform behind the altar. There are candles and garlands in place, but also stacks of \ncardboard boxes and gallons of distilled-water. Numerous animal costumes hang from a rolling garment rack. An old nun crosses the aisle carrying a large, metal coffee dispenser. Two young priests cross in the opposite direction carrying folding cots. Voices shout urgently off-screen: \nVOICES (O.S.) More sandbags! We need dry blankets! Wake up the Deacon! \nSam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop slowly poke their heads in from the side door and creep up the stairs to the choir loft. \nEXT. SCOUT FESTIVAL. DAY \nThe entire brigade of scouts stands assembled in formation in the rain. The last two stragglers come running and hurry into their positions. They all wear rain slickers or canvas ponchos. Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the commander's entourage emerge quickly from the command tent. Commander Pierce shouts: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE Attention, company! Prepare for -- \nCommander Pierce hesitates. He points down to the marina and says to Secretary McIntire: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE Who's that? \nSecretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see: \nScout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat. He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up to the assembly. He salutes Commander Pierce. Commander Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity: \nCOMMANDER PIERCE You call yourself a Khaki Scout? \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (HESITATES) I'm sorry, sir? \nCOMMANDER PIERCE (ENRAGED) Where's your goddamn troop? They could get killed out there! \nSCOUT MASTER WARD (SURPRISED) You don't have them? \nCOMMANDER PIERCE (DISGUSTED) You're a liability to us. \nSECRETARY MCINTIRE (IN EXPLANATION) The incident may affect our insurance premiums. \nCommander Pierce looks at Scout Master Ward's breast pocket. \nINSERT: \n", "test3_id": 2327}

{"test1_input": "(again seen close at the phone) \nThat was free verse, you gashouse palooka! \nGORDON \n(at the phone in the newspaper office) \nFree verse, huh? \n(shouting) \nWhat the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more. \nPETER \n(in his phone booth) \nThat's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve. \n(after a pause) \nYeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that\u0097 \nGORDON \n(in his office) \nWhen you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. \n(at this point, Gordon's secretary enters) \nSECRETARY \nMr. Gordon\u0097 \nGORDON \n(looking up) \nHuh? \nSECRETARY \nDid you know he reversed the charges on that call? \nGORDON \nWhat! \n(into the phone) \nSay, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office\u0097unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. \n(he bangs down the receiver viciously and glowers at the phone) \nIn the PHONE BOOTH Peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him. But he goes right on for the benefit of the boys. \nPETER \n(into the dead phone) \nOh, so you're changing your tune, eh? Well, it's about time. But it's going to do you no good, my tough friend. It's a little too late for apologies. I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees! I hope this is a lesson to you! \nHe snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged pride, following which the view expands to include his public. \nMEN \nAtta-boy, Peter. That's telling him, Peter. \nThe gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he talked to the boss as Peter staggers out of the booth. \nPETER \nGive me any of his lip, will he? Huh! I guess he knows now what I think of his job! \n(expansively) \nIs my chariot ready? \nFIRST MAN \nYour chariot awaiteth withouteth, oh mighty King. \nMEN \nMake way for the King. Long live the King. Make way. \nWith head held high, he struts majestically out of sight, followed by his admirers, following which the scene dissolves to the BUS STATION. His inebriated admirers stand around the entrance to a bus, while Peter stands on the steps, his suitcase in his hand. \nPETER \n(making a grand speech) \nThat's right, my friends. Cling to your jobs! Remain slaves the rest of your lives! Scum of the earth! Newspaper men! Not me! When I'm basking in the glorious arms of the Muse\u0097what'll you be doing? Chasing news. You miserable worms. For what? A mere pittance! My heart goes out to you. \n(with arms extended and in tremolo voice) \nGood-bye. \n(and with this he turns his back and enters the bus) \nMEN \n(in the same spirit) \nGoodbye, Oh mighty King! Peace be with you, Courageous One! \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE \nAll aboard. Philadelphia, New York. All aboard. \nGROUP \nLook out. Get back. Farewell. Farewell. \nPETER \nScram. \nThe scene cuts to the INTERIOR of the BUS as viewed from the front, the view moving forward, passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats. Every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable, which adds to their uninviting appearance. Mothers cling to crying babies. A Swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey. A surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes. The moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers. \nStanding before the seat is Peter, his suitcase in his hand, speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers. \nPETER \n(calling) \nHey, driver! How about clearing this stuff away! \nSeveral passengers (seen from his position in the back) crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder. Through a glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute instructions from a superintendent, who stands on the running board, their voices in- \ndistinguishable. In answer to Peter's request, the driver glances back indifferently, and continues talking to the superintendent. A close view of PETER shows him arching his eyebrows, an amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver. He drops his suitcase and starts forward. Then we see him arriving at the glass partition, and Peter taps playfully on the pane with his finger-nails, whereupon the driver turns and pulls the window down a few inches. \nDRIVER \n(annoyed) \nWhadda you want! \nPETER \n(pleasantly) \nIf you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat. \nDRIVER \n(irritably) \nOkay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. \n(with which remark the driver turns away from him) \nPETER \n(looking at the back of the driver's neck for a moment, then confidentially) \nJust between you and me, I never intended taking it off. \nHe wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat. En route he bestows genial smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers, and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is breastfeeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles from her lips. \nPETER \nPersonally, I was raised on a bottle. \n(as the woman looks up at him, perplexed) \nWhen I was a baby, I insisted on it. You know why? \n(as the woman stares up stupidly) \nI never liked the idea of getting cigarette ashes in my eyes. \nHe moves forward, leaving the woman unable to make head or tail of it; and assuming that he's crazy, she shrugs her shoulders and turns her attention to the baby. \nNow PETER arrives at his seat, and whistling softly, raises the window. Unhurriedly, he picks the newspaper bundles up one by one and flings them out of the window. They hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud. Thereupon a close view of the DRIVER shows him reacting violently to Peter's unprecedented cheek, and starting down from his seat. \nPETER has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles and still whistling his favorite melody, he picks up his suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead. At this point, the driver enters the side door of the bus. \nDRIVER \n(pugnaciously) \nHey, wait a minute! \nPeter, his arms holding the suitcase over his head, turns and glances at the driver, a quizzical look in his eyes. \nDRIVER \n", "test1_true": "What do you think you're doing! \nPETER \n(turning) \nHuh? \nDRIVER \n(bellowing) \nThe papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out! \nPETER \nOh\u0097the papers\u0097 \nHe slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the floor. \nPETER \n(now seen close, with the Driver) \nThat's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants. \nDRIVER \nHey, whadda you tryin' to do\u0097kid me? \nPETER \nOh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants. \nDRIVER \nWhat're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up. \nPETER \n(turning to his suitcase) \nIt's okay with me. I'm not arguing. \nDRIVER \n(pugnaciously) \nFresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. \nPETER \n(turning back to him) \nLook here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss. \nDuring his speech, Ellie enters from the rear and plunks herself into Peter's seat. Unseen by Peter, she places her small bag beside her. \nDRIVER \n(answering Peter; weakly) \nOh, yeah? \nPETER \nNow, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago. \nDRIVER \nOh, yeah? \nPETER \n(exhausted) \nYou win! \nSmiling, he turns to sit down. But the smile dies on his face when he finds his place occupied by Ellie, who stares out the window. \nPETER \n(now at close range, with Ellie) \nExcuse me, lady\u0097 \n(slowly)\u0097 \nbut that upon which you sit\u0097is mine. \nEllie glances up at him\u0097then down at her buttocks. \nELLIE \n(eyes flashing) \nI beg your pardon! \nPETER \nNow, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you\u0097 \n(gesturing with thumb) \nscram. \nELLIE \n(ignoring him\u0097calling) \nDriver! \nThe driver, who has stopped to witness this new altercation, returns. \nELLIE \nAre those seats reserved? \nDRIVER \n(pleased to discomfort Peter) \nNo. First come, first served. \nELLIE \n(dismissing the whole thing) \nThank you. \n(Peter, thwarted for a moment, just glares at her) \nPETER \n(also calling) \nDriver! \nDRIVER \nYeah? \nPETER \nThese seats accommodate two passengers, don't they? \nDRIVER \n(hating to give in) \nMaybe they do\u0097and maybe they don't. \nPeter lifts Ellie's overnight bag off the seat and drops it on the floor. Part of her coat covers the small space by her side. This he sweeps across her lap. \nPETER \nMove over, lady. This is a \"maybe they do.\" \nHe plops into the seat, the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief. Ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him. But Peter suddenly looks down toward the floor, following which a close-up AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag on the floor annoys Peter. With his foot he slowly moves it over to her, and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again. Next we see Ellie glaring at him, picking up her bag, and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead. But just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her, and she falls backward right in Peter's lap. Their noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, and they glare at each other hostilely. Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat, turning her back on him. \nPETER \n(amused) \nNext time you drop in, bring your folks. \nThis dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD, and the bus sways perilously as it speeds through the night, following which the view dissolves to the INTERIOR of the BUS, revealing Peter slumped in his seat, his hat drawn over his eyes. Ellie has her head thrown back, trying to sleep. But the swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side uncomfortably, and finally she gives up. \nELLIE \n(an order) \nTell that man not to drive so fast. \n(at which Peter just cocks his head slightly) \nPETER \nAre you talking to me? \nELLIE \nYes. Tell that man to drive slowly. \nPeter stares at her a moment, resenting her officious manner. \nPETER \n(pleasantly) \n", "test1_id": 2910, "test2_input": "Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you? \nPETER \n(dryly) \nYeah, swell. \nPeter takes the rope out of his bag. It is the one used for the \"Walls of Jericho\" previously. He lays it aside and then, remembering, retrieves it. For a moment he holds it in his hand, speculatively; then turning, proceeds to tack it up. The noise of the tacking attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie (again seen close) turns and looks toward Peter. \nELLIE \nIs that the Walls of Jericho going up? \nPETER'S VOICE \nYep! The Walls of Jericho. \n(at which she turns back to the window) \nPETER (also seen close) stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side. \nPETER \n(then reaching for blanket) \nWe certainly outsmarted your father. \n(he throws the blanket over the rope) \nI guess you ought to be happy. \nThere is no response from her, a close view revealing that she quite obviously isn't happy. They are now separated by the blanket, and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket. \nELLIE \nThank you. \n(there is silence while Peter starts undressing) \nELLIE \n(suddenly) \nAm I going to see you in New York? \nPETER \n(laconically) \nNope. \nELLIE \nWhy not? \nPETER glances up at the \"Walls of Jericho\" and after a speculative pause, speaks quietly. \nPETER \nI don't make it a policy to run around with married women. \nA close-up of Ellie, disclosing only her neck and shoulders, shows her slipping out of her clothes. She pauses\u0097then looks up. \nELLIE \nNo harm in your coming to see us. \nPETER'S VOICE \nNot interested. \n(at this Ellie's face falls, this is a definite rebuff) \nELLIE \n(weakly) \nWon't I ever see you again? \nPETER (seen close) is now getting into his pajamas. \nPETER \nWhat do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn't I? \n(his mouth screws up bitterly) \nThat's what you wanted, wasn't it? \nELLIE is already in bed, staring up at the ceiling. \nELLIE \nPeter, have you ever been in love? \nPETER crawls into bed. \nPETER \nI probably did the world a great favor at that. Got two pinheads out of circulation. \n(he reaches over and lights a cigarette) \nCupid thinks he's doing something when he brings two lovers together. What good's that? I'm bringing two pains-in-the-neck together. I think I'll start an institution\u0097hang out a shingle. \nThe view now widens to include both sides of the blanket. Ellie doesn't hear a word of Peter's attack. She is too intent on her own thoughts. \nELLIE \nHaven't you ever wanted to fall in love? \nPETER \nMe? \nELLIE \nYes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. \nPETER \n(disdainfully) \nMaybe. \n(after a pause) \nSure\u0097sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd\u0097 \n(interrupting himself) \nYeah, but where you going to find her\u0097somebody that's real\u0097somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more. \nELLIE'S disappointment is apparent. \nPETER \n(seen close) \nI've even been sucker enough to make plans. \n(a long puff on his cigarette) \nI saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That's where I'd like to take her. But she'd have to be the sort of a girl that'd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nights\u0097and love it as much as I did. \n(he loses himself in his romantic contemplations) \nYou know, those nights when you and the moon and the water all become one\u0097when something comes over you\u0097and you feel that you're part of something big and marvelous. \n(sighing) \nThose are the only places to live. Where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around. \nA close-up of ELLIE at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heaven\u0097from which she is excluded, as she listens to him continuing. \nPETER'S VOICE \nCertainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things\u0097 \nPETER (again seen close) has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward. \nPETER \nI'm going to Swim in the surf with her\u0097I'm going to reach up and grab stars for her\u0097I'm going to laugh with her\u0097and cry with her. I'm going to kiss her wet lips\u0097and\u0097 \nSuddenly stopping, he turns his head slowly, sensing Ellie's nearness; and the view, drawing back to include Ellie, shows her standing at his bedside, looking down at him yearningly. \nThen we see them close together: Peter's face is immobile. Ellie drops to her knees. \nELLIE \n(fervently) \nTake me with you, Peter. Take me to your island. I want to do all those things you talked about. \nPeter stares at her lovely face. His heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms. \nPETER \n(after a long pause; hoarsely) \nBetter go back to your bed. \nELLIE \n(simply) \nI love you. \n", "test2_true": "(arguing with himself) \nYou're forgetting you're married. \nELLIE \n(tensely) \nI don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself. \n(begging) \nPlease, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you. \n(in a choked voice) \nOh, Peter\u0097 \nSobbing, she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms around him. All is quiet for a moment as Ellie's head rests on his breast, while Peter struggles with an overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her. \nPETER \n(scarcely audible) \nBetter go back to your bed. \nThere is a lengthy pause, neither of them stirs. Then Ellie slowly raises her tear-stained face and gets to her feet. \nELLIE \n(whispering) \nI'm sorry. \nShe turns and disappears behind the blanket. Peter remains motionless. Then a close view shows Ellie, as she gets into bed, sobbing quietly. She hides her face in the pillow to suppress her sobs. It is the first time in her life that she has been so deeply hurt. A close view next shows Peter reaching over for a cigarette, which he lights. All his movements are thoughtful, meditative. He leans back and stares at the ceiling, until we see only the cigarette in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke. This dissolving, the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down, a long, frail ash hanging perilously on. Peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a tray. He leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is quiet. Then glancing over in Ellie's direction, he calls to her: \nPETER \n(softly calling) \nHey, Brat\u0097! \n(a pause) \nDid you mean that? Would you really go? \n(he waits for a response, but none comes. He tries again) \nHey, Brat\u0097 \nHe listens\u0097all is quiet. He slips his covers off and crosses to the blanket, and peers over it. She is asleep. Her tear-stained face rests on the pillow, her arm extends over her head. It is a childlike posture. \nPETER is watching her tenderly. He speculates whether to awaken her and decides against it. He starts away. Peter tiptoes around the room for a few moments, deep in thought. Then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind begins to take form, he hastily begins dressing. \nThe scene dissolving, Peter is seen completely clothed and starting for the door when he thinks of something. He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out into the night. Thereupon the scene wipes off, disclosing a Gas Station along the road at night. Here Peter is talking to a station attendant. \nPETER \nAll I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars. \nMAN \n(hesitatingly) \nYeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas. \nPETER \n(\"high-pressuring\" him) \nListen, man\u0097I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say? \nMAN \n(looking at Peter's hat) \nI ain't got a hat\u0097 \nPETER \nWhat? \nMAN \nI ain't got a hat. \nPETER \n(promptly putting it on his head) \nWell, you got one now. \u0097Come on, fill 'er up. \nWhile he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of Peter driving furiously, a broad, happy grin on his face, following which several scenes wipe off in succession (denoting the passage of time) \u0097scenes of Peter driving at high speed, causing several cows to amble out of the way; of the CAR driving into the Holland Tunnel, and of the BACK ROOM of a SPEAKEASY where Peter stands in \nfront of a small desk upon which there is a typewriter. Near him is a swarthy Italian. \nPETER \nFine! That's fine, Tony. Now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour. \nITALIAN \n(going out) \nSure. Sure, Pete. \nAs Peter plants himself in front of the machine, the scene dissolves to a close-up of the typewriter carriage upon which are typed the words: \n\"\u0097and that's the full and exclusive story of Ellen Andrews' adventures on the road. As soon as her marriage to King Westley is annulled, she and Peter Warne, famous newspaperman\u0097and undoubtedly the most promising young novelist of the present era\u0097will be married.\" \nThe view drawing back, Peter re-reads the last sentence, smiles contentedly, and as he yanks out the sheet, the scene wipes off disclosing the outside of GORDON'S OFFICE, the sign on the door reading: \"Office\u0097Mr. Gordon.\" Gordon's secretary is at her desk as Peter breezes in. \nPETER \n(rumpling her hair) \nHello, Agnes. \nAGNES \nBetter not go in. He'll shoot you on sight. \nPETER \n(entering) \nI haven't been shot at for days. \nIn GORDON'S OFFICE, Gordon is at his desk. He looks up when Peter enters. \nGORDON \n(rising to his full height menacingly) \nGet out of here! \nPETER \n(advancing) \nWait a minute, Gordon\u0097I\u0097 \nGORDON \n(quietly) \nGet out! \nPeter reaches his side, and grabs him by the arms. \nPETER \nJoe, listen\u0097 \nGORDON \nDon't \"Joe\" me. \nPETER \nOkay, Joe. Listen\u0097you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn\u0097anytime I ran into a story that looked good\u0097I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe. \nGORDON \nYou mean about the Andrews' kid? \nPETER \nThat's it. \n(tapping his pocket) \nI got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars. \nUpon hearing this GORDON is ready to jump out of his skin. \nGORDON \nA thousand dollars! \n(furiously) \nGet out of this office before I throw you out bodily. \nPETER \nDon't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars\u0097and I need it quick. I'm in a jam. \nGORDON \n", "test2_id": 2911, "test3_input": "Yes, I know\u0097but\u0097 \nPETER \nWhat's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars! \nANDREWS \nLet me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars? \nPETER \nWhat ten thousand? \nANDREWS \nThe reward. \nPETER \n(sharply) \nWho said anything about a reward! \nANDREWS \n(smiling) \nI'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for\u0097 \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nAll I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters. \nANDREWS \nYou're a peculiar chap. \nPETER \n(irritably) \nWe'll go into that some other time. \nANDREWS \nThe average man would go after the reward. All you seem to\u0097 \nPETER \nListen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. \n(he burns at the thought) \nWhen somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. \nANDREWS \nYou were taken for a buggy ride? \nPETER \nYeah\u0097with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it? \nA close-up indicates that ANDREWS has been studying Peter throughout the scene. He is now completely won over. \nANDREWS \n(smiling) \nCertainly. \n(he opens a checkbook and writes it out) \nWhile Andrews writes, Peter wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt. Andrews rises and goes to him. \nANDREWS \nHere you are. \n(as Peter takes the check) \nDo you mind if I ask you something frankly? \n(Peter just looks at him without responding) \nDo you love my daughter? \nPETER \n(evasively, while folding the check) \nA guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined. \nANDREWS \nThat's an evasion. \nPETER \n(putting the check into a wallet) \nShe grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! \n(pocketing wallet) \nWhat she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day\u0097whether it's coming to her or not. \nA close view of the TWO shows Andrews smiling: Here is a man! \nPETER \nIf you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself\u0097long ago. \nANDREWS \nDo you love her? \nPETER \n(going for his hat as he replies) \nA normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. \n(going to the door) \nShe's my idea of nothing! \nANDREWS \nI asked you a question. Do you love her? \nPETER \n(snapping it out) \nYes! \n(as Andrews smiles) \nBut don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself. \nHe snaps the door open and goes out, following which ANDREWS is seen watching the door, his eyes twinkling, and the scene cuts to the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY as Peter comes through, moving on to the front door. But just as he reaches it, Ellie enters, accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in her hand. They see each other almost simultaneously, and both stop, glaring. \nPETER \n(looking her over contemptuously) \nPerfect! Now you look natural. \nAt this Ellie leaves her group and comes toward Peter, and a close view shows them together, glaring at each other. \nELLIE \n(icily) \nI hope you got your money. \nPETER \nYou bet I did. \nELLIE \nCongratulations. \nPETER \nSame to you. \nELLIE \nWhy don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely. \nPETER \nI would. But I've got a weak stomach. \nHe wheels around and goes through the door, Ellie looking after him, her eyes blazing. The drone of a plane motor outside is heard, and several people rush down the stairs, all excited. \nGUESTS \nHere comes King! He's just coming down! Hurry up, everybody! Come on, Ellie! \nImmediately there is a general excitement, as guests hurry through the hallway on the way to the lawn. But Ellen does not move\u0097she remains staring blankly at the door through which Peter went until Andrews enters from his study. \nANDREWS \n", "test3_true": "ELLEN \n(her voice breaking) \nI'm not interested. \nANDREWS \nNow, wait a minute, Ellie\u0097 \nELLIE \n(sharply) \nI don't want to hear anything about him! \nShe walks away from him, and Andrews, frustrated, looks at her helplessly. Thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view of the LAWN. The orchestra is playing Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The lawn is crowded with guests. In the background we see the autogyro idling. A closer view shows a small platform, serving as an altar. Over it there is an arbor of roses. Back of the altar stands a minister, ready. A reverse view reveals a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading to the house. Both sides are lined with guests, who are murmuring excitedly. At the moment, King Westley and his best man are marching solemnly toward the altar. Back of the altar we see a high platform upon which are several newsreel men who are grinding their cameras. \nThe guests, of whom close glimpses are caught, are now peering over each other's shoulders. King and his best man have reached the altar, and the music of the wedding march comes to a stop. The orchestra leader is looking around, apparently waiting for a signal. At the DOOR of the HOUSE a very \"prissy\" middle-aged man waves his handkerchief and nods his head to the orchestra leader. The orchestra leader acknowledges the signal by nodding his head\u0097turns to his men\u0097waves his baton, and the orchestra starts playing, \"Here Comes the Bride.\"\u0097The guests whisper to each other excitedly. A great deal of stirring takes place. \nThe door of the house slowly opens\u0097and a parade of small flower girls emerges. They march, taking each step carefully, while they strew flowers along the path. They are well out of the way when Ellie, on the arm of her father, appears in the doorway. A view of the guests shows that they cannot contain themselves. Murmurs of \"Here she comes,\" and \"Doesn't she look beautiful?\" are heard. The newsreel men on their platform behind the altar bestir themselves. This is what they've been waiting for! \nELLIE and her FATHER (seen close) now make their way to the altar. Ellie's face is solemn, and her jaws set. \nANDREWS \n(whispering out of the side of his mouth) \nYou're a sucker to go through with this. \nEllie glances at him out of the corner of her eye\u0097and quickly turns forward again. \nANDREWS \nThat guy Warne is O.K. He didn't want the reward. \nEllie keeps her eyes glued in front of her, remaining expressionless. \nANDREWS \nAll he asked for was thirty-nine dollars and sixty cents . . . that's what he spent on you. It was a matter of principle with him\u0097says you took him for a ride. \nThis registers on Ellie and she raises her eyes\u0097but her reaction is only slightly perceptible. \nA close view of a GROUP OF GUESTS shows two girls looking enviously in the direction of the bride. \nA YOUNG GIRL \n(whispering) \nI wish I were in her shoes. \nSECOND GIRL \nYes. She certainly is lucky. \nELLIE and her FATHER are seen again, and ANDREWS is still whispering to her. \nANDREWS \nHe loves you, Ellie. Told me so. \nThis brings a definite reaction, which she quickly covers up. \nANDREWS \nYou don't want to be married to a mug like Westley. \nAt this there is a close view of Westley\u0097there is a satisfied smirk on his face. \nANDREWS \nI can buy him off for a pot of gold, and you can make an old man happy, and you wouldn't do so bad for yourself. If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate. \nEllie gives no indication of her intentions. Her face remains immobile. And now Ellie and her father have reached the altar. The \"prissy\" man is placing them in position. The big moment has arrived. The guests are all atwitter. But a close view of ELLIE shows that she realizes that her fate is closing in on her. She looks around for a means of escape. \nMINISTER \n(starting the ceremony) \nDearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him speak now or else hereafter forever hold his \npeace. King, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife? So long as ye both shall live? \nKING \nI will. \nMINISTER \nEllen, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband so long as ye both shall live? \nThen, seen at the ALTAR, Ellie makes her decision. She reaches down, takes a firm hold on her train and, pushing several people aside, runs out of the scene. Those at the altar look up, surprised, and the most startled of all is KING himself. \nKING \n(calling after her) \nEllie! \nHe starts to go after her\u0097but finds Andrews in his way while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus. \nGUESTS \nWhat's happened? Where's she going? \nOn the platform, the newsreel men, a look of astonishment on their faces, decide to follow Ellie. \nA MAN \nGet her, Mac! She's ducking! \nAnd, as viewed by the newsreel men, Ellie is seen in the distance dashing through the gates. The guests stare dumbfounded. Following this, Andrews and King are seen together in the crowd. \nKING \n(helplessly) \nWhat happened? \nANDREWS \n(blandly) \nI haven't the slightest idea. \nBut his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling. As King runs out of sight Andrews gets out a cigar and lights it\u0097a happy smile on his face which he now doesn't try to conceal. \nOutside the FRONT GATE Ellie is seen in a fast roadster, as she starts away with a plunge. Her eyes sparkle. A crowd of people dash up, headed by King. They stop dead when they see the car disappear. On the LAWN the commotion runs high, and the guests chatter their amazement. A close view of ANDREWS shows him smiling with satisfaction. \nThe scene dissolves to ANDREWS' OFFICE, where Andrews is regaling himself with a whiskey and soda. He is in a pleasantly inebriated mood when his SECRETARY enters. \nANDREWS \n(as he picks up the phone that has started ringing) \nDon't want to talk to\u0097don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody. \nSECRETARY \nBut it's King Westley on the phone. \nANDREWS \nOoooooh. \n(into the phone) \nHello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap. \n(as he hangs up) \nDon't fall out of any windows. \nSECRETARY \n(placing a telegram on the desk) \nThere's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan. \nANDREWS \n(reading it) \n\"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.\" \n(to the Secretary) \nSend him a telegram right away. Just say: \"Let 'em topple.\" \nThis dissolves to the exterior of an AUTO CAMP very much like the other camps at which Peter and Ellie stayed. The owner's wife is talking to her husband. \nWIFE \nFunny couple, ain't they? \nMAN \nYeah. \nWIFE \nIf you ask me, I don't believe they're married. \nMAN \nThey're married all right. I just seen the license. \nWIFE \n", "test3_id": 2912}

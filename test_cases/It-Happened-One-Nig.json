{"train": "IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT \nWritten by Robert previous hit Riskin \nbased on a story by Samuel Hopkins Adams \nThe HARBOR at Miami Beach fades in, providing quick views of yachts, aquaplanes, and luxurious ship-craft lying at anchor in the calm, tranquil waters of tropical Florida. This dissolves to the NAME PLATE on the side of a yacht, reading \"ELSPETH II,\" and this in turn to a YACHT CORRIDOR where a steward is standing in front of a cabin door, near a small collapsible table upon which there is a tray of steaming food. He lifts lids and examines the contents. A heavy-set sailor stands guard near the cabin door.[1] \nSTEWARD \nFine! Fine! She ought to like this. \n(to the guard) \nOpen the door. \nGUARD \n(without moving) \nWho's gonna take it in to her? You? \nSTEWARD \nOh, no. \n(turning) \nMullison! Come on! \nThe view widens to include Mullison, a waiter. His eye is decorated with a \"shiner.\" \nMULLISON \nNot me, sir. She threw a ketchup bottle at me this morning. \nSTEWARD \nWell, orders are orders! Somebody's gotta take it in. \n(he turns to someone else) \nFredericks! \nThe view moves to another waiter, who has a patch of bandage on his face. \nFREDERICKS \nBefore I bring her another meal, I'll be put off the ship first. \nSTEWARD'S VOICE \nHenri! \nThe view moves over to a Frenchman. \nHENRI \n(vehemently) \nNo, Monsieur. When I leave the Ritz you do not say I have to wait on crazy womans. \nThe view moves back to include the Steward and the others grouped around him. \nANOTHER WAITER (A COCKNEY) \nMy wife was an angel compared to this one, sir. And I walked out on her . \nGUARD \n(impatiently) \nCome on! Make up your mind! \nA petty officer approaches. He is blustering and officious, but the type that is feeble and ineffective. His name is Lacey. \nLACEY \n(talking quickly\u0097staccato) \nWhat's up? What's up? \nThere is a fairly close picture of the GROUP featuring Lacey and the Steward. \nSTEWARD \nThese pigs! They're afraid to take her food in. \nLACEY \nThat's ridiculous! Afraid of a mere girl! \n(he wheels on the steward) \nWhy didn't you do it yourself? \nSTEWARD \n(more afraid than the others\u0097stammering) \nWhy\u0097I\u0097well, I never thought about\u0097 \nLACEY \n(shoving him aside) \nI never heard of such a thing! Afraid of a mere girl. \n(moving to the tray) \nI'll take it in myself. \nThey all stand around and watch him, much relieved. He picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin. \nLACEY \n(as he walks\u0097muttering) \nCan't get a thing done unless you do it yourself. \n(as he approaches the door) \nOpen the door. \nWe see him at the CABIN DOOR as the guard quickly and gingerly unlocks it. \nLACEY \nAfraid of a mere girl! Ridiculous. \nLacey stalks in bravely, the tray held majestically in front of him, while the steward and waiters form a circle around the door, waiting expectantly. There is a short pause, following which Lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands on his back, the tray of food scattering all over him. The steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the waiters stare silently. \nThe scene dissolves to the MAIN DECK of the yacht, first affording a close view of a pair of well-shod masculine feet, as they pace agitatedly back and forth. Then as the scene draws back, the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered to be Alexander Andrews, immaculately groomed in yachting clothes. In front of him stands a uniformed Captain, but Andrews, brows wrinkled, deep in thought, continues his pacing. \nANDREWS \n(murmuring to himself) \nOn a hunger strike, huh? \n(a grunt) \nWhen'd she eat last? \nCAPTAIN \nShe hasn't had a thing yesterday\u0097or today. \nANDREWS \nBeen sending her meals in regularly? \nCAPTAIN \nYessir. She refuses them all. \nANDREWS \n(snappily) \nWhy didn't you jam it down her throat? \nCAPTAIN \nIt's not quite that simple. \n(he shakes his head) \nI've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one\u0097 \nANDREWS \nAbsurd! \n(muttering) \nAll this fuss over a snip of a girl. \n(suddenly) \nI'm going down to see her myself. \nHe leaves with determination, followed by the Captain, and both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin, Andrews grim. \nCAPTAIN \nThis is dangerous business, Mr. Andrews. After all, kidnapping is no child's play. \nBut Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward. They arrive in front of the cabin door, where Lacey is brushing himself off, and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes. \nELLIE \n(bluffing it through) \nWill you please tell me what you're raving about! \nPETER \nYou'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. \nELLIE \nYou must have me confused with\u0097 \nPETER \n(interrupting) \nQuit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. \nHe pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly. \nPETER \n(while she reads) \nTake my advice\u0097grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. \nELLIE \n(looking up at him) \nI didn't ask for your advice. \n(she hands the paper back) \nPETER \nThat's right. You didn't. \nELLIE \nYou're not going to notify my father, are you? \nPETER \n(looking at her squarely) \nWhat for? \nELLIE \nIf you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. \n(a disdainful expression crosses his face) \nPETER \nI never thought of that. \nELLIE \n(frantically) \nListen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. \nPETER \n(furious) \nNever mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word \"Humility\"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, \"Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?\" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me. \nHe turns his back on her and leaves. A close-up of ELLIE shows her staring after him, her eyes blazing angrily. \nIn a TELEGRAPH OFFICE, Peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter, which she reads. \nPETER \n(brusquely) \nYou send telegrams here? \nOPERATOR \n(recognizing him apparently, sarcastically) \nI'm just fine thanks, and how are you? \n(reading) \nTo \"Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is\u0097\" \n(looking up excitedly) \nNo, do you really? \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nGo on. Go on send the telegram. \nOPERATOR \n\"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of\u0097of\u0097\" \nPETER \nMush. Mush. \nOPERATOR \n\"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne.\" Well, that will be $2.60. \nPETER \nSend it collect. \nOPERATOR \nCollect? \nPeter \n(firmly) \nCollect. \nAs the clerk takes the wire from him, scene fades out. \nPart Three \nThe BUS TERMINAL fades in. It is night now, and the rain comes down in torrents. People scurry around to get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard: \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE \nBus for blah-blah-blah-blah\u0097Charleston\u0097blah-blah-blah\u0097and all points North to New York! \nThis dissolves to the interior of a BUS, which is practically filled. Peter is in his seat, reading a magazine, while Ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward. As she approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, and deliberately passes him, plunking herself into a seat in the opposite aisle. Peter turns just as she gets seated. He glances at her indifferently. \nA close view shows Ellie seated next to a man who sits reading a newspaper which covers his face. Her eyes are fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie makes it plain that he is a typical drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet, and without lowering the newspaper, his gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, the view moves down until it reaches Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme agitation is evident. The view moves back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely leg as far as the knee. Then we see ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers his paper, and turns for a scrutiny of her face. What he sees apparently delights him, for he drops his paper completely\u0097and smiles broadly. \nDRUMMER \nHi, sister\u0097All alone? My name's Shapeley. \n(Ellie favors him with a devastating look which is wasted on the drummer) \nMight as well get acquainted. It's gonna be a long trip\u0097gets tiresome later on. Specially for somebody like you. You look like you got class. \n(he surveys her from head to foot) \nYessir! With a capital K. \n(he chuckles at his own sally) \nAnd I'm a guy that knows class when he sees it, believe you me. \nA close-up of ELLIE, as Shapeley's voice continues, shows her glancing back at Peter, expecting him to come to her rescue. \nSHAPELEY'S VOICE \nAsk any of the boys. They'll tell you. Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em. Yessir. Shapeley's the name, and that's the way I like 'em. \nEllie again looks toward Peter. But PETER seems to have found something of unusual interest in his magazine . . . and we again see the harassed ELLIE and the irrepressible SHAPELEY, who continues. \nSHAPELEY \nYou made no mistake sitting next to me. \n(confidentially) \nJust between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. \n(he pulls out a cigar, and continues\u0097awed by the recollection) \nYessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. \n(he lights his cigar, takes a vigorous puff, and turns to her again) \nWhat's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. \nELLIE \n(intending to freeze him) \nSeems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. \n(this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer) \nHere, boy\u0097! \nPeter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money out. Ellie stares at him dumbfounded. \nPETER \nA dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going? \nELLIE \n(vehemently) \nThat's none of your business. \nPETER \n(with finality) \nYou're on a budget from now on. \n(he flings her purse back at her and pockets the money) \nELLIE \nNow, just a minute\u0097you can't\u0097 \nPETER \nShut up! \nHe returns to his magazine, leaving her staring at him petulantly as the scene fades out. \nPart Four \nSOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD at night. This is apparently on the outskirts of a town. Two local policemen and our bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth. The rain sweeps across their faces as they talk. The passengers in the bus, which stands in the background, stick their heads out, trying to hear what is going on. \nFIRST POLICEMAN \nYou won't be able to pass till morning. \nSECOND POLICEMAN \nNot even then, if this keeps up. \nPeter approaches the group and is then seen with the officers and the driver. \nPETER \nWhat's up? \nFIRST POLICEMAN \nBridge washed out\u0097around Dawson. \nDRIVER \nLooks like we can't go through till morning. \nSECOND POLICEMAN \n(his only contribution) \nNot even then, if this keeps up. \nFIRST POLICEMAN \nAny of your passengers want a place to sleep\u0097there's an auto camp up yonder a piece. \nPETER \n(interested) \nYeah? Where? \nFIRST POLICEMAN \n(pointing) \nUp yonder. See the lights? \nPETER \nYeah. \nFIRST POLICEMAN \nThat's it. Dyke's Auto Camp. \nPETER \nThanks. \nHe dashes toward the bus. Then he appears at the side door of the bus. \nPETER \n(calling) \nHey, Brat\u0097! \n(he is about to enter when he sees Ellie) \nThe view moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step. \nELLIE \n(haughtily) \nAre you talking to me! \nPETER \nYeah. Come on\u0097we're stopping here for the night. \nHe disappears inside the bus through the side door. With an independent toss of her head, Ellie turns and also enters the bus, but through the rear door. \nThe scene dissolves to DYKE'S AUTO CAMP. Ellie stands alone on the porch of a small bungalow, sheltered from the rain. Over her head is a sign reading: \nOFFICE-Dyke Auto Co.\u0097P. D. Dyke, Prop. \nShe looks about her restlessly, giving the impression that she has been waiting for someone. Suddenly she is attracted by something and gazes in its direction. Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, there appears, about twenty yards away, a small cabin, lighted on the inside; and from it Peter emerges accompanied by a man\u0097presumably Mr. Dyke. We cannot hear what is being said; from their movements, however, it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place. Dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward Ellie. At the same time, Peter calls to her: \nPETER \n(shouting) \nHey! Come on! We're all set. \n(saying which he enters the cabin) \nEllie hesitates a moment, then starts toward the cabin. Now she is hurrying across the open space. En route she passes Dyke. \nDYKE \n(as they pass) \nGood evening. Hope you and your husband rest comfortably. \nEllie keeps on running, but suddenly she stops dead and looks back at Dyke, following which a close-up of ELLIE shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment. Her impulse is to call Dyke back, to make him repeat what he said\u0097to make certain she heard him correctly. But Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin. Then slowly the corners of her mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism. So that's it, is it! He has given her no previous evidence of being \"on the make\"; yet now, with the first opportunity\u0097. Her thoughts, however, are interrupted by Peter's voice: \nPETER'S VOICE \nWell, Brat\u0097what do you say! \nAs she doesn't stir, there appears a close-up view of PETER standing in the doorway of the cabin, looking toward Ellie. \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nCome on! Come on! What are you going to do? \nStand there all night? \n(he disappears inside) \nFor a long moment, ELLIE is lost in speculation as to how to proceed. Then, tossing her head defiantly, with her lips set grimly, she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it, stops in the doorway and peers in. As she does this, there is a view of the inside of the CABIN, as seen by her at the door. Except for two cots on either side of the room, a few sticks of cane furniture, a small table upon which stands an oil burner for cooking, the place is barren. At the moment Peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the room. His suitcase is already open. And now Ellie steps inside, surveying the place contemptuously. But Peter, with his back to her, is oblivious of her presence; and as he works, he hums his favorite melody. Ellie finally breaks the silence. \nELLIE \n(sarcastically) \nDarn clever, these Armenians. \nPETER \n(seen close as he turns) \nYeah. Yeah, it's a gift. \n(but he finishes his hammering and turns to his suitcase) \nELLIE \n(seen with Peter) \nI just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband. \nPETER \n(carelessly) \nOh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. \n(the matter-of-fact way in which he says this causes her eyebrows to lift) \nELLIE \nOh, you did? What am I expected to do\u0097leap for joy? \nDo you mind putting out the light? \nPETER \nNot at all. \n(he leans over and snaps it off) \nThe room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light coming in the window from the night-light outside the camp. Visible are Peter's face and arms as he stares ceilingward, while on Ellie's side all we can see of her is her silhouette, except for such times as she gets in direct line with the window. There are glimpses of her as she moves around in the process of undressing, and we see, or rather sense, her dress dropping to the floor. She now stands in her chemise; this being white silk, it stands out more prominently against the darkness. She picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner, following which a close-up of her head and shoulders shows her glancing apprehensively toward Peter's side of the room; and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand, with the other she slips the strap off her shoulders. She flings her \"slip\" over the blanket. \nPETER, on his side of the room, looks toward the blanket, and reacts to the \"slip\" coming into sight. Then other undergarments join the \"slip\" on the blanket. \nPETER \n(hoarsely) \nDo you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? \n(a pause) \nIt's tough enough as it is. \nELLIE'S VOICE \nOh, excuse me. \n(and we see the underthings flipped off the blanket.) \nEllie's side of the room appears, showing her crawling quickly into bed, pulling the covers over her and glancing apprehensively in Peter's direction\u0097following which a close view shows PETER being very conscious of her proximity. The situation is delicate and dangerous; the room is atingle with sex. He turns his gaze toward the blanket. The view moves to the BLANKET, remaining on it a moment. It is a frail barrier. The view then moves back to Peter, whose eyes are still on the blanket, his face expressionless. A close view of ELLIE, next shows that she, too, has her eyes glued on the blanket, a little fearfully. She turns her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment. Then suddenly her eyes widen\u0097and she sits up abruptly. \nELLIE \n(seriously) \nOh, by the way\u0097what's your name? \nPETER \n(seen close; turning his head toward her) \nWhat's that? \nELLIE \n(both sides of the blanket coming into view) \nWho are you? \nPETER \nWho, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face. \nELLIE \n(interrupting) \nYou've got a name, haven't you? \nPETER \nYeah. I got a name. Peter Warne. \nELLIE \nPeter Warne? I don't like it. \nPETER \nDon't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. \nELLIE \n(flopping back on her pillow as she mumbles) \nPleased to meet you, Mr. Warne . . . \nPETER \nThe pleasure is all mine. \nThere is silence between them for a few seconds. \nPETER \nI've been thinking about you. \nELLIE'S VOICE \nYes? \nPETER \nYou've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed. \nEllie doesn't like the implication, and glares in his direction as Peter's voice continues: \nPETER'S VOICE \n(meaningly) \nI'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you? \nELLIE \n(hard) \nGoodnight, Mr. Warne. \n(she turns over) \nPETER \nGoodnight. \nHe also turns his head toward the wall, and the scene fades out. \nPart Five \nA long view of the SKY, in the early morning, fades in. In the dim distance there is a speck, which, as it comes nearer, turns out to be an airplane. The drone of its motors becomes louder and louder. Then the view cuts to the CONTROL COCKPIT of the PLANE revealing TWO PILOTS. \nFIRST PILOT \n(shouting to other) \nThe old man's screwy! \nSECOND PILOT \n(who can't hear him) \nWhat's 'at? \nFIRST PILOT \n(louder) \nI said, the old man's screwy! \nSECOND PILOT \n(nodding his head in agreement) \nYeah! \nFIRST PILOT \n(cupping his mouth) \nThe dame's too smart for him. \nSECOND PILOT \n(nodding again, then leaning over) \nHow'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that? \nThe First Pilot grimaces in disgust, grabs his nose between his fingers, and goes through the motion of ducking under water. And as they both laugh, the scene cuts to the CABIN of the plane, a privately built plane which has all the equipment of a passenger ship. Andrews and one of his secretaries, a conservative-appearing man of middle age, lean over a table. This being a closed cabin, the roar of the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue. \nSECRETARY \nHere's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston. \n(as there is a close view of the two) \n\"Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible.\" Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston. \nANDREWS \nAny others? \nSECRETARY \nYessir. \n(holding up stack of wires) \nThere's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them? \nANDREWS \n(impatiently) \nWhat do they say? \nSECRETARY \nThey're practically all the same, sir. \n(he shrugs his shoulders to indicate there is no news) \n(dignifiedly) \nWhere'd you say the showers\u0097and things\u0097were? \n(Peter turns; when he sees her he laughs) \nPETER \n(appraisingly) \nHey\u0097you're little, aren't you? \nELLIE \nWhere is the shower? \nPETER \nYour hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. \nELLIE \n(leaving haughtily) \nI'll find it myself. \nShe slams the door viciously, but Peter rushes over to the window to watch her; and as viewed by him, Ellie appears next walking to the showers outside the cabin. She holds her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances. Then in the cabin, at the window, Peter watching Ellie, chuckles at her, shaking his head in amusement. He starts toward the table, and the scene cuts to a moving view outside \nthe cabins, with Ellie walking past several cottages on her way to the showers. Several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her destination. There are two wooden shacks adjoining, each having a sign on them; one reads, \"Showers\u0097Men\"\u0097the other, \"Showers\u0097Women.\" In front of the women's shower there are several unappetizing-looking fat women waiting, and with them is a small girl. Ellie crosses over to the women's shower and disappears inside, the waiting women staring at her, puzzled. A moment elapses and Ellie backs out, being pushed by a woman, part of whose naked body is visible, and whose voice is heard in protest: \nWOMAN \nCan't a body have some privacy around here? \nThe women who are waiting chuckle at Ellie's embarrassment as she stands aside. They certainly are making a monkey out of her decorum. The little girl keeps eyeing Ellie, fascinated. \nLITTLE GIRL \n(pointing) \nDon't she look funny, Mama? \nEllie, wheeling on the little girl, crushes her with a devastating look, so that the little girl cringes against her mother's skirt. Ellie goes to the end of the line to await her turn, following which close-ups show the LITTLE GIRL slowly turning her head to look at Ellie, and ELLIE noticing the little girl staring at her, whereupon Ellie sticks her tongue out at her. And, in a scene which includes both, the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue out also. \nThis dissolves to a view of ELLIE coming out of the showers. At the same time Shapeley comes out of the men's shower, and upon seeing Ellie, his face lights up. \nSHAPELEY \nHello, sister. \nEllie ignores him, and walks toward her cabin. But Shapeley falls into step with her. \nSHAPELEY \nSorry about last night. Didn't know you were married to that guy. Shoulda told me about it right off. \n(he chuckles) \nThere I was, gettin' myself all primed for a killin', and you turn out to be an old married woman. \nThe scene cuts to the door of PETER'S CABIN as Peter comes out, stands in the doorway, and is surprised to see Ellie and Shapeley, who are then seen (from his angle) talking. Thereupon PETER is seen again as his lip curls up a little jealously; he returns to the cabin, following which we again see Ellie and Shapeley walking. He notices the robe she is wearing, and he looks down toward her feet, the view moving down to show Ellie's legs and feet. The pajama legs are seen protruding below the robe, the cuffs of which she has turned up. Then the view moving back up to Ellie and Shapeley, he lifts her robe playfully. \nSHAPELEY \nHey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir. \nELLIE \n(stopping\u0097her eyes blazing) \nIf you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours. \nSHAPELEY \n(startled) \nSorry\u0097I didn't mean to\u0097 \nELLIE \n(sharply) \nGet out! \nSHAPELEY \nOkay. I was just trying to make conversation. \nEllie leaves him abruptly, and the scene cuts to the CABIN, where Peter is now busy setting the small table. Ellie enters after a moment, while Peter has his back to the door. \nPETER \n(without turning) \nHigh time you got back. \nELLIE \nI met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files. \nShe disappears behind the blanket, following which we see Peter's side of the cabin, while Ellie's voice continues from behind the blanket. \nELLIE'S VOICE \nWe must come back to this place often. You meet the nicest people! \nHer head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she dresses. \nELLIE \nI saw the little Pussinfoos girl. She's turned out quite a charming creature. \nPeter ignores her chatter, except for an annoyed glance once in a while. \nELLIE \nVery outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute? \nPETER \nHurry up and get dressed. \nELLIE \n(sticking her head over blanket) \nWhy, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends? \nPETER \nIf you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer\u0097we'd have been through with breakfast by this time. \nA close view shows ELLIE in the process of buttoning her dress. She looks up, having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice, which intrigues her. She starts to the other side of the blanket. Then we see her joining Peter in his part of the cabin. \nELLIE \nWell, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to. \nPETER \nI know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime. \n(setting a plate for her) \nCome on, sit down. \nELLIE \nThank you. \n(sitting down to the table; referring to the food) \nMy, my! Scrambled eggs. \nPETER \nEgg. One egg\u0097doughnuts\u0097black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? \nELLIE \n(cheerily) \nNope. No complaints. \nPETER \nI'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint. \nELLIE \n(\"sweetly\") \nWhy, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. \nPETER \n(gruffly) \nWhat makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? \nELLIE \nMust be the Spring. \nPETER \nI thought maybe\u0097uh\u0097\"believe you me\" told you a couple of snappy stories. \nELLIE \nPETER'S VOICE \n(from behind blanket) \nI hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don't you? She's always wanted a boy. I think we'll stop over in Wilkes-Barre this trip, darling. Give the family a treat. \nA close view shows Ellie and the detective. They have been staring at each other. \nELLIE \n(very sweet, calling to Peter) \nThere's a man here to see you, Sweetheart. \nPETER'S VOICE \nWho\u0097me? \n(appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly) \nWant to see me? \nDETECTIVE \n(who hasn't taken his eyes off Ellie) \nWhat's your name? \nELLIE \n(innocently) \nAre you addressing me? \nDETECTIVE \nYeah. What's your name? \nPETER \n(stepping in front of him) \nHey, wait a minute! You're talking to my wife! You can't walk in here and\u0097what do you want, anyway? \nDETECTIVE \nWe're looking for somebody. \nPETER \nWell, look your head off\u0097but don't come bustin' in here. This isn't a public park. \nWhile Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered. They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie. \nPETER \nI got a good mind to sock you right in the nose. \nFIRST DETECTIVE \nTake it easy, son. Take it easy. \nSECOND DETECTIVE \n(crowding forward) \nWhat's up? \nThe Second Detective's eyes fall on Ellie and he stops to stare at her suspiciously. He takes a photograph out of his pocket which he inspects. \nDYKE \n(explains) \nThese men are detectives, Mr. Warne. \nPETER \n(shouting) \nI wouldn't care if they were the whole police department. They can't come in here and start shooting questions at my wife! \nELLIE \n(appearing very domestic) \nDon't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question. \nPETER \n(turning on her; very sarcastic) \nThere you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? \nELLIE \n(sharply; entering into the spirit of the pretense) \nWell, you don't have to lose your temper! \nPETER \n(mimicking her) \nYou don't have to lose your temper! \n(in his own voice) \nThat's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you\u0097 \nELLIE \nHe didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times! \nThe two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other two, who are now out of sight. \nPETER'S VOICE \n(screaming) \nOh, no! I saw him! He kept pawing you all over the dance floor! \nELLIE'S VOICE \nHe didn't! You were drunk! \nPETER \n(now seen with Ellie) \nOh, so now I was drunk! \nELLIE \nWell, you were! \nPETER \nI'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him. \nELLIE \nYeah, and gotten yourself arrested! \nPETER \nAw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family! \nELLIE \n(starting to cry) \nPeter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute. \nEllie goes over to her cot, and starts picking up her hat and things, whereupon Dyke, very much affected, turns to the detectives. \nDYKE \nNow look what you've done! \nFIRST DETECTIVE \n(apologetically) \nSorry, Mr. Warne. But you see, we're supposed to check up on everybody. \nSECOND DETECTIVE \nWe're looking for a girl by the name of Ellen Andrews. You know\u0097the daughter of the big Wall Street mug. \nA close-up of ELLIE appears as their voices are heard. \nFIRST DETECTIVE'S VOICE \nYour wife sure looks like her. Don't she, Mac? \nSECOND DETECTIVE'S VOICE \nShe sure does. \nPETER \n(the entire group coming into view) \nWell, I hope you find her. \n(to Ellie) \nQuit bawling! Quit bawling! \nSome of the out of town papers may not have a picture of her. Here\u0097wire this to them\u0097I want it to break right away. \nAs he hands the picture to Brown, the view moves in to a close-up of the PICTURE which dissolves to a close-up of the same picture in a newspaper, and as the view draws slowly back we see the headline over it, which reads \n\"DAUGHTER OF BANKER DISAPPEARS \nTEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD\" \nThe view then draws back to reveal SHAPELEY reading the newspaper. He stares long and absorbedly at the picture. Then slowly he turns his head toward the rear of the bus, and the view following his gaze passes a group of men singing \"The Man On the Flying Trapeze.\" They are huddled together, and accompanied by a man who plays a guitar. Then the view continues moving until it reaches Peter and Ellie who join in the song, and a close-up of ELLIE shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily. \nSHAPELEY looks back at Ellie, and apparently comes to the conclusion that his suspicions are correct, for he quickly folds the newspaper, casting a surreptitious glance around to make certain he is not being watched. A diabolical smirk spreads over his face. \nA full view of the interior of the bus shows most of the occupants joining in the fun, singing. They seem unmindful of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus, which throws them against each other. Then the view draws in to a front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten. The woman's face is haggard and she sways \nuncertainly, her eyes half closed. Her small son's frightened face peers up at her. \nBOY \n(in a trembling voice) \nWhat'sa matter, Ma? Don't you feel all right? \nThe woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure. She presses her son's small hand in a feeble effort at assurance. \nA close view of Ellie and Peter shows ELLIE singing more boisterously than the rest, doing the comical song with exaggerated gestures. But suddenly her face clouds, at something she sees. \nELLIE \n(touching Peter's arm) \nPeter! \n(as he turns) \nThere's something the matter with that woman. She looks ill. \nPeter follows her gaze, whereupon we see the WOMAN. Her head rolls weakly, a pained expression on her face. \nELLIE \n(again seen with Peter; sympathetically) \nI better go over and see her. \nPETER \nDon't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman\u0097a trip like this. \nELLIE \n(worried) \nYes. \nWe see the other passengers around Ellie and Peter enjoying themselves. One of them pokes her. \nMAN \nHey, Galli-Curci,[9] come on\u0097get onto it! \n(poking Peter) \nYou, too, McCormack. \nEllie and Peter snap into it; they are just in time for the long wail which precedes the chorus: \nELLIE AND PETER \n(singing) \n\"O-o-o-oh\u0097He flies through the air with the \ngreatest of ease\u0097 \nThis daring young man on the flying trapeze\u0097\" \nAt this the scene cuts to the ROAD. The bus is caught in a muddy road, full of ruts, and at the moment wavers dangerously at an angle. The left front wheel is stuck in a deep hole, and the engine roars and clatters as the driver feeds the gas. Finally the bus moves forward, extricating the wheel; but just as it does, the right front wheel falls into another mud hole on the other side, and this time the bus seems hopelessly stuck, a close-up of the RIGHT WHEEL showing it revolving desperately, but in vain. The mud splashes in all directions, and the wheel seems to sink deeper and deeper. Thereupon this view cuts to the inside of the BUS. The bus \nis tilted over at an extreme angle, which has thrown Ellie into a corner on the floor, where she now crouches in an undignified position. She looks like a turtle, her head being invisible. \nELLIE \n(sticking her head out) \nThank the man for me, Peter. This is the first comfortable position I've had all night. \nPeter, amused, is assisting her to her feet. The guitarist has continued his playing uninterrupted, and as Peter lifts Ellie, he sings: \nPETER \n(singing) \n\"She flies through the air with the greatest of ease. \nThis darin' young maid on the flying trapeze\u0097 \n(grunting) \nHer movements are graceful\u0097all men does she please\u0097\" \nA close view of the WOMAN and the LITTLE BOY now shows the latter terrifiedly watching his mother, whose head sags wearily. Finally she topples forward in a swoon. \nBOY \n(with a moan) \nMa! Ma! What'sa matter with you? \n(tears stream down his cheeks) \nSomebody help me! Somethin's happened to her! \nThe music stops abruptly. Everyone looks up, startled. Ellie starts forward, followed by Peter. Passengers closely group around the woman and chatter. \"She's fainted. Look how pale she is.\" \nPeter and Ellie step up. \nPETER. \nGet some water, somebody. \n(to the boy) \nLet me get in here, son. \nEllie goes out of sight to get water. The boy cries audibly, terror-stricken, but gets out of Peter's way, and Peter lifts the woman up and stretches her across the seat. Ellie comes back with water which she silently hands to Peter, who administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her eyes, makes her drink the water. The woman looks around, bewildered. \nPETER \n(consolingly) \nThat's better. You're all right now. Just took a little nose-dive, that's all. \nHe assists her in sitting up. The boy's wailing is heard, and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother. \nBOY \n(crying) \nMa\u0097oh, gee, Ma\u0097! \nHis mother clings to him, but still feeling faint, her head sways. Peter looks up at Ellie and gives her a sign to sit down beside the woman. ELLIE sits down beside her. Peter takes the boy by the shoulders. \nPETER \nCome on, son. Better give your mother a chance to snap out of it. \n(as the boy emits a heart-breaking sob) \nIt's all right, son. She'll be okay in a couple of minutes. \nHe leads the boy away, while Ellie places her arm around the woman. \nELLIE \nYou'd better rest. It's been a hard trip, hasn't it? \nThe scene cuts to a close view of SHAPELEY who has his eye peeled on Peter, watching him, and we next see Peter and the boy, who is still sobbing quietly. They are now standing away from the other passengers. \nBOY \nWe ain't ate nothin' since yestidday. \nPETER \nWhat happened to your money? \nBOY \nMa spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much. \n(with a new outburst) \nWe shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York\u0097and if we didn't go, she might lose it. \nPETER \nGoing without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody? \nBOY \nI was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess. \nPeter reaches into his pocket for a bill, just as Ellie approaches them. \nELLIE \nShe'll be all right, soon's she gets something to eat. \nPeter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket for a smaller one. Before he can find anything, however, Ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy. \n(suddenly) \nDo you pack a gat?[11] \nA close view of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. \nSHAPELEY \nHuh? \nPETER \nA gat! A gat! \n(feeling him) \nGot any fireworks on you? \nSHAPELEY \n(weakly) \nWhy\u0097no\u0097 \nPETER \n(carelessly) \nThat's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them. \n(Shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something he hadn't bargained for, and stares speechlessly at Peter, who continues blandly) \nExpect a little trouble up North. May have to shoot it out with cops. \nThe perspiration starts appearing on Shapeley's brow (as we see him in a close-up). Peter's voice continues: \nPETER'S VOICE \n(with emphasis) \nIf you come through all right, your five G's are in the bag. Maybe more. I'll talk to the \"Killer\"\u0097see that he takes care of you. \nSHAPELEY \n(finally finding his voice) \nThe Killer? \nPETER \n(seen with Shapeley; watching the latter to gauge the effect of his words) \nYeah\u0097the \"big boy\"\u0097the Boss of the outfit. \nSHAPELEY \n(shakily) \nYou're not kidnapping her, are you? \nPETER \n(tough) \nWhat else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you? \n(contemptuously) \nTen thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers. \nSHAPELEY \n(stammering) \nSay, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see\u0097and\u0097 \nPETER \nWhat's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow? \nSHAPELEY \n(raising his voice, pleadingly) \nBut I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with\u0097 \nPETER \n(gripping his arm) \nSh-sh-sh\u0097! Soft pedal, you mug!\u0097before I\u0097 What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! \n(low and menacingly) \nNow listen, you're in this thing\u0097and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much. \nSHAPELEY \n(frightened out of his wits) \nI won't say anything. Honest, I won't. \nPETER \nYeah ?\u0097How do I know? \n(he reaches into his coat threateningly) \nI gotta good mind to plug you. \n(arguing with himself) \nI shouldn't take any chances on you. \nSHAPELEY \n(breaking down) \nYou can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut. \nPETER. \nYeah? \n(he glares at Shapeley a moment silently, as if making up his mind) \nWhat's your name? \nSHAPELEY \nOscar Shapeley. \nPETER \nWhere do you live? \nSHAPELEY \nOrange, New Jersey. \nPETER \nGot a couple of kids, huh? \nSHAPELEY \nYeah. Just babies. \nPETER \nYou love them, don't you? \nSHAPELEY \n(sensing the threat; horrified) \nOh, gee, Mister\u0097you wouldn't\u0097you ain't thinkin' about\u0097 \nPETER \n(threateningly) \nYou'll keep your trap shut, all right. \nSHAPELEY \n(quickly) \nSure\u0097sure\u0097I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister. \nPETER \nIf you don't\u0097Ever hear of Bugs Dooley? \nSHAPELEY \nNo. \nPETER \nNice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the \nriver. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out. \n(Shapeley can't stand much more of this. He is ready to keel over) \nSHAPELEY \nGee! That musta been terrible. \nYour father didn't know beans about \"piggy-back\" riding. \nELLIE \n(another silence before she speaks again) \nMy uncle\u0097Mother's brother\u0097had four children . . . and I've seen them ride \"piggy-back.\" \nPETER \nI don't think there's a \"piggy-back\" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good \"piggy-back\" rider. \nELLIE \nThat's silly. \nPETER \nTo be a \"piggy-backer\" it takes complete relaxation\u0097a warm heart\u0097and a loving nature. \nELLIE \nAnd rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose. \nPETER \nNot a one. \nELLIE \nYou're prejudiced. \nPETER \nShow me a good \"piggy-back\" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance\u0097a natural \"piggy-backer.\" \n(contemptuously) \nWhere do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family? \n(turning) \nWhy, your father knew so much about \"piggy-back\" riding that he\u0097 \nIn his excitement he wheels around to speak to her, forgetting that as he turns she goes with him. Not finding her at his right, he swings around to his left. Naturally he takes Ellie with him\u0097and realizing his mistake he mutters: \nPETER \nAw, nuts! \nHe proceeds on his way, walking faster than before. They continue this way silently for some time. Finally Ellie breaks the silence. \nELLIE \n(persistently) \nMy father was a great \"piggy-backer.\" \nPeter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust, then calmly hands his suitcase to her. \nPETER \nHold this a minute. \nEllie takes the suitcase from him, and his hand now free, he delivers a resounding smack on her backside, so that Ellie lets out a yelp. \nPETER \n(taking the suitcase) \nThank you. \nThe scene dissolves to the edge of a cow PASTURE, at night, and Ellie and Peter are revealed climbing under a barbed wire fence, following which the scene dissolves to a HAYSTACK, in front. Peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout, Ellie watching him. \nPETER \n(to himself) \nThis looks like the best spot. \nELLIE \nWe're not going to sleep out here, are we? \nPETER \nI don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it. \nAnd he busies himself laying out a bed for her, pulling hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground. Ellie wanders aim-lessly and then moves to a rock, where she sits and watches Peter. \nELLIE \n(after a pause; coyly) \nPeter\u0097 \nPETER \n(as a close view shows him still arranging her bed; grumbling) \nWhat? \nELLIE'S VOICE \nI'm hungry. \nPETER \n(without looking up) \nJust your imagination. \nELLIE \n(seen at the rock, while Peter is out of sight) \nNo, it isn't. I'm hungry and\u0097and scared. \nPETER'S VOICE \nYou can't be hungry and scared at the same time. \nELLIE \n(insisting) \nWell, I am. \nPETER \n(as both he and Ellie are seen in their respective places) \nIf you're scared it scares the hunger out of you. \nELLIE \n(argumentatively) \nNot if you're more hungry than scared. \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nAll right. You win. Let's forget it. \nELLIE \n(after a pause) \nI can't forget it. I'm still hungry. \nPETER \n(tearing his hair; screaming) \nHoly Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you! \nThis brings silence, and he goes on building a bed for her. Then a close-up of Ellie shows her watching him. Her eyes soften. A very definite interest in him is slowly but surely blossoming, and the fact that he is making her bed adds to the intimacy of the scene. A close view of PETER shows him concentrating on his task, but he pauses a moment and turns to glance at her. It is a devouring look, which he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed. \nPETER \n(muttering while he works) \nIf I had any sense, I'd have been in New York by this time. \n(he emphasizes his feelings by yanking viciously at the hay as both of them are now seen) \nTaking a married woman back to her husband. Hunh! What a prize sucker I turned out to be. \n(He has her bed ready; without glancing at her) \nCome on\u0097your bed's all ready. \nShe, watches him a moment, then rising slowly, starts toward Peter. Then she stands over her bed, surveying it speculatively. \nELLIE \nI'll get my clothes all wrinkled. \nPETER \n(sharply) \nWell, take them off. \nELLIE \n(shocked) \n(after a pause) \nNothing you'd give two cents for. \nELLIE \n(seen close) \nTry me. \nPETER'S VOICE \nI just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish. \n(now appearing with her) \nIf they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed\u0097 \n(looking up) \nRight now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired\u0097and it's the only thing around. \nELLIE \nYou sound like a hobo. \nPETER \nI am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter? \nELLIE \nDoesn't sound very exciting. \nPETER, seen close, looks at her for a long time before speaking: \nPETER \nI guess not. I'd have given odds it wouldn't mean anything to you. \n(he goes over and flops down on his own side of hay) \nThere were moments when I had hopes. When I\u0097aw, I'm wasting time\u0097You're destined to be a dope the rest of your life. \n(contemptuously) \nI pity you. Goodnight. \nHe turns over with a finality that precludes any further discussion, following which a close-up of ELLIE reveals that her eyes are wide open, staring thoughtfully up at the sky. The scene fades out slowly. \nPart Seven \nA ROAD fades in. It is day now, and Peter and Ellie are trundling along. Ellie limps, and wears an unhappy expression on her face. \nELLIE \nWhat are you thinking about? \nPETER \nBy a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. \nELLIE \n(pleased) \nReally? \nPETER \nYeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. \nELLIE \nWhat'd you say we're supposed to be doing? \nPETER \nHitch-hiking. \nELLIE \nWell, you've given me a very good example of the hiking\u0097 \n(strongly) \nwhere does the hitching come in? \nPETER \n(amused at her) \nA little early yet. No cars out yet. \nShe spies a rock and heads for it. Then we see her seated on the rock. \nELLIE \nIf it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. \n(Peter comes over, sets his bag down, and prepares to wait) \nGot a toothpick? \nPETER \nNo. But I've got a penknife. \n(he extracts one from his pocket which he snaps open) \nELLIE \nHay\u0097in my teeth. \nShe points to her front teeth, and Peter flicks the hay out of her teeth. \nPETER \nThere it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. \nELLIE \nNeedn't rub it in. \n(Peter takes a carrot out of his coat pocket and starts nibbling on it; Ellie looks up at this) \nWhat're you eating? \nPETER \nCarrots. \nELLIE \nRaw? \nPETER \nUh-huh. Want one? \nELLIE \n(emphatically) \nNo!! \n(as Peter smacks his lips with satisfaction) \nIt's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. \nPETER \nYou don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. \n(he takes a bite) \nBest thing in the world for you\u0097carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me\u0097goodnight! \nELLIE \nI hate the horrid stuff. \nWhile she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed. Peter and Ellie both jump up. \nPETER \nI wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. \n(Ellie goes back to her rock, despondently) \nELLIE \nWhat if nobody stops for us? \nPETER \nOh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them. \nELLIE \nYou're an expert, I suppose. \nPETER \nExpert! Going to write a book on it. Called the \"Hitch-Hikers Hail.\" \nELLIE \nThere's no end to your accomplishments. \nAs life's corners I . . . \nPETER \n(giving up) \nAll right, let it go. \nDANKER \n(completing his last line) \n. . . turn.\" \nThe scene dissolves to the front of a LUNCH WAGON on a deserted road, and Danker's car drives into the scene and stops. Then we see Danker turning to Ellie and Peter. \nDANKER \nHow about a bite to eat? \nELLIE \n(quickly) \nWhy, I think that would be\u0097 \nPETER \n(stopping her) \nNo, thanks. We're not hungry. \nDANKER \n(sentimentally) \nOh, I see, young people in love are never hungry. \nPETER \nNo. \nDANKER \n(singing as he leaves them) \n\"Young people in love \nAre very seldom hungry. \nPeople in love \nAre very seldom hungry . . .\" \nWhen he is out of sight, Peter glares at Ellie. \nPETER \nWhat were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13] \nELLIE \n(defiantly) \nWhy not? I'm hungry. \nPETER \nEat a carrot. \nELLIE \nNever! \n(she starts out of car) \nI'm going in and ask him\u0097 \nPETER \n(grabbing her arm) \nIf you do, I'll break your neck. \nShe looks up at his glowering face, realizes he means it, and wilts under his dominant gaze. \nPETER \nLet's get out and stretch our legs. \nPeter gets out, followed by Ellie, and they walk away from the car. Both are silent. At the DOOR of the LUNCH WAGON, then, Danker comes out and looks around furtively. Ellie and Peter, as seen by him, appear, walking away, following which the view moves over to the Ford and drops down to a close-up of Peter's suitcase. Now Danker looks about quickly and starts toward his car. He springs into the car, steps on the starter, and is off. \nELLIE and PETER hear the motor. They wheel around, and their eyes widen in surprise. \nPETER \nHey! \nHe flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford. He is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road. Peter continues the pursuit. This scene wiping off, the FORD now makes its appearance around the bend, and as it approaches, Peter is seen at the wheel. He looks like he's just been through a fight. And as Peter rides in, Ellie comes running toward him. \nELLIE \n(a note of great relief in her voice) \nOh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right? \nPETER \nCome on\u0097get in. \nELLIE \n(noticing a gash in his cheek) \nOh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on\u0097 \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nCome on! come on! \n(at this she runs around to get in the other side) \nELLIE \n(as she runs) \nWhat happened? \nPETER \n(as we see them closer) \nJust a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! \n(by this time she is in the car) \nELLIE \nWhat'd you give him for the car? \nPETER \nA black eye. \n(thereupon the car moves out of sight) \nA close view shows Peter and Ellie driving along in the Ford. Peter looks ahead, uncommunicatively. Ellie glances up at him, and it is plain that something's on her mind. \nELLIE \n(a little self-consciously) \nLook\u0097uh\u0097how are the\u0097uh\u0097carrots holding out? Any left? \nPeter glances at her. He knows what a concession this is on her part, and he smiles sympathetically. \nPETER \n(tenderly) \nYou don't have to eat the carrots. \n(as she looks her surprise) \nJust passed a pond with some ducks in it. \nELLIE \n(with a cry of joy) \nDarling! \nShe reaches up and kisses his cheek, and Peter beams happily. \nPETER \n(looking worried) \nHaven't much gas left in this thing. Got to start promoting some. \n(throwing her his coat) \nBetter take the things out of the pocket of that coat. Ought to be good for ten gallons. \nThe scene fades out. \nPart Eight \nYes. You'll have a great story, won't you? \nPETER \n(dryly) \nYeah, swell. \nPeter takes the rope out of his bag. It is the one used for the \"Walls of Jericho\" previously. He lays it aside and then, remembering, retrieves it. For a moment he holds it in his hand, speculatively; then turning, proceeds to tack it up. The noise of the tacking attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie (again seen close) turns and looks toward Peter. \nELLIE \nIs that the Walls of Jericho going up? \nPETER'S VOICE \nYep! The Walls of Jericho. \n(at which she turns back to the window) \nPETER (also seen close) stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side. \nPETER \n(then reaching for blanket) \nWe certainly outsmarted your father. \n(he throws the blanket over the rope) \nI guess you ought to be happy. \nThere is no response from her, a close view revealing that she quite obviously isn't happy. They are now separated by the blanket, and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket. \nELLIE \nThank you. \n(there is silence while Peter starts undressing) \nELLIE \n(suddenly) \nAm I going to see you in New York? \nPETER \n(laconically) \nNope. \nELLIE \nWhy not? \nPETER glances up at the \"Walls of Jericho\" and after a speculative pause, speaks quietly. \nPETER \nI don't make it a policy to run around with married women. \nA close-up of Ellie, disclosing only her neck and shoulders, shows her slipping out of her clothes. She pauses\u0097then looks up. \nELLIE \nNo harm in your coming to see us. \nPETER'S VOICE \nNot interested. \n(at this Ellie's face falls, this is a definite rebuff) \nELLIE \n(weakly) \nWon't I ever see you again? \nPETER (seen close) is now getting into his pajamas. \nPETER \nWhat do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn't I? \n(his mouth screws up bitterly) \nThat's what you wanted, wasn't it? \nELLIE is already in bed, staring up at the ceiling. \nELLIE \nPeter, have you ever been in love? \nPETER crawls into bed. \nPETER \nI probably did the world a great favor at that. Got two pinheads out of circulation. \n(he reaches over and lights a cigarette) \nCupid thinks he's doing something when he brings two lovers together. What good's that? I'm bringing two pains-in-the-neck together. I think I'll start an institution\u0097hang out a shingle. \nThe view now widens to include both sides of the blanket. Ellie doesn't hear a word of Peter's attack. She is too intent on her own thoughts. \nELLIE \nHaven't you ever wanted to fall in love? \nPETER \nMe? \nELLIE \nYes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. \nPETER \n(disdainfully) \nMaybe. \n(after a pause) \nSure\u0097sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd\u0097 \n(interrupting himself) \nYeah, but where you going to find her\u0097somebody that's real\u0097somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more. \nELLIE'S disappointment is apparent. \nPETER \n(seen close) \nI've even been sucker enough to make plans. \n(a long puff on his cigarette) \nI saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That's where I'd like to take her. But she'd have to be the sort of a girl that'd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nights\u0097and love it as much as I did. \n(he loses himself in his romantic contemplations) \nYou know, those nights when you and the moon and the water all become one\u0097when something comes over you\u0097and you feel that you're part of something big and marvelous. \n(sighing) \nThose are the only places to live. Where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around. \nA close-up of ELLIE at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heaven\u0097from which she is excluded, as she listens to him continuing. \nPETER'S VOICE \nCertainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things\u0097 \nPETER (again seen close) has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward. \nPETER \nI'm going to Swim in the surf with her\u0097I'm going to reach up and grab stars for her\u0097I'm going to laugh with her\u0097and cry with her. I'm going to kiss her wet lips\u0097and\u0097 \nSuddenly stopping, he turns his head slowly, sensing Ellie's nearness; and the view, drawing back to include Ellie, shows her standing at his bedside, looking down at him yearningly. \nThen we see them close together: Peter's face is immobile. Ellie drops to her knees. \nELLIE \n(fervently) \nTake me with you, Peter. Take me to your island. I want to do all those things you talked about. \nPeter stares at her lovely face. His heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms. \nPETER \n(after a long pause; hoarsely) \nBetter go back to your bed. \nELLIE \n(simply) \nI love you. \n(softening) \nWhat's the thousand bucks for? \nPETER \nTo tear down the Walls of Jericho. \nGORDON \nWhat! \nPETER \nNever mind . . . Listen\u0097suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. \nGORDON \nHuh? \nPETER \nThat she's going to marry somebody else. \nGORDON \nYou're drunk. \nPETER \nWould an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you? \nGORDON \nIf it's on the level. \nPETER \nWell, I got it, Joe. \nGORDON \nWho's she gonna marry? \nPETER \n(taking out the story from his pocket) \nIt's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. \nGORDON \n(skeptically) \nI wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk. \nPETER \nWait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! \nGORDON \nI'd put you there myself. \nPETER \nSure. I wouldn't blame you, either. \nGORDON \nWho's the guy she's gonna marry? \nPETER \nI am, Joe. \nGORDON \n(his eyes widening) \nYou! \nPETER \nYeah. \nGORDON \nNow I know you're drunk. \n(he grabs his hat) \nI'm going home. Don't annoy me any more. \nPETER \n(running after Gordon as the latter starts out) \nFor heaven's sake, Joe\u0097stop being an editor for just a minute. \n(he grabs his arm) \nWe've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. \nGordon is affected by the sincere note in Peter's voice. \nPETER \nI met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. \n(hoarsely) \nI'm in love with her, Joe. \nGORDON \nWell, I'll be\u0097 \nPETER \nListen, Pal\u0097you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. \n(self-consciously) \nA guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he? \nWhile Peter has been speaking Gordon stares into space thoughtfully. \nGORDON \nWhat a story! \n(picturing it) \nOn her way to join her husband, Ellen Andrews falls in love with\u0097 \n(alert\u0097grabbing paper out of Peter's hand) \nLemme see that a minute. \nHe moves to his desk excitedly, and Peter, a gleam of hope in his eyes, joins him, following which the scene cuts to the SHACK of the camp owner and wife in the early morning. The owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice of his wife calling, \"zeke! zeke!\" He looks up, just as she rushes into the room. \nWIFE \nI told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone! \nOWNER \nWho? \nWIFE \nThat feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. \n(pulling at him) \nCome on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it. \nThereupon the scene cuts to the AUTO CAMP CABIN affording a close view of ELLIE tossing restlessly in her sleep. Suddenly there is a loud banging on the door, and Ellie, startled, awakens. The pounding continuing, Ellie looks around, frightened. The door suddenly bursts open, and the owner and wife enter. They both glance over at Peter's side. \nWIFE \nSee that. They're gone! \nOWNER \n(timidly) \nLooks like it, don't it? \n(suddenly he sees Ellie) \nHere's the woman, ma. \nWIFE \n(full of fight\u0097glaring at Ellie) \nOh!! \nELLIE \n(in a close view at Ellie's Bed as the owner and his wife come up to her; timidly\u0097sitting up) \nWhat's the matter? \nWIFE \nWhere's your husband, young lady\u0097 \nWith King Westley in it. He's waiting at the church. Big tears streaming down his face. His bride hasn't shown up. Old Man Andrews is there, \ntoo. Laughing his head off. Everything exaggerated. You know\u0097Now snap into it! \n(he bangs up the receiver, and grabs the second phone, speaking into it impatiently) \nYeah. Yeah. What is it? \nA close view of GORDON, as he listens, shows his eyes widening with amazement. \nGORDON \nWhat!\u0097Ellen Andrews! You're crazy! \nThis cuts to a TELEPHONE BOOTH where a reporter is seen speaking excitedly. \nREPORTER \nYeah. She just phoned her father from an auto camp to come and get her. He's getting a police escort. Westley's going along, too. She's been traveling by bus. The moment she read that her father and Westley made up, she phoned in. \nBack in GORDON'S OFFICE Gordon is seen still at the phone. \nGORDON \nYou sure that's right! Say, you haven't been drinking, have you! Okay\u0097grab a car\u0097and stay with them. \n(he hangs up the receiver and grabs the first phone) \nPut Hank on. \n(shouting) \nAgnes! \n(as the secretary hurries in) \nGet me a doctor. I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. \n(she stares at him dumbly as he speaks into the phone) \nHank\u0097forget everything I just told you. I was just having a nightmare! \n(he hangs up\u0097and turns to Agnes) \nCall up the police department! Tell 'em to find Peter Warne. Send out a general alarm. I want the dirty crook pinched. \nHe picks up Peter's story and flings it viciously into the wastebasket. \nAGNES \n(starting out) \nYessir. \n(two re-write men come in, passing Agnes) \nMEN \nYou want us? \nGORDON \n(wheeling around) \nYeah. Shove everything off the front page. Ellen Andrews just phoned her father\u0097she's coming home. The moment she heard the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up. Spread it all over the place. Here's your lead: \"Love Triumphant!\" Step on it! \nMEN \n(leaving) \nYessir. \nGordon goes to his desk, mumbling to himself. His eye lights on the waste basket containing Peter's story, and he is about to kick it when he stops. He stares at it thoughtfully, reaches down, lifts it out\u0097runs through it hastily\u0097and then stares into space, deep in thought. \nThe scene dissolves to an open ROAD, in the morning, as Peter flies over it in his Ford. He beams happily. He passes a gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver. This dissolves to a close-up of an AUTO SIREN accompanied by a prolonged wail, then to a ROAD, that morning, as four motorcycles, two abreast, speed forward, followed by a luxurious limousine, which in turn is trailed by a car filled with reporters. Next, in the LIMOUSINE, Andrews is seen in the back seat. He is accompanied by King Westley\u0097Henderson\u0097Lovington, and a police inspector. \nHENDERSON \nI knew she was safe. \nLOVINGTON \n(sighing) \nCertainly gave us a run for our money. \n(but Andrews is too overwhelmed with joy to listen to any of this) \nANDREWS \n(anxiously) \nCan't you get them to go any faster? \n(at this the Inspector leans over to talk to chauffeur) \nThis dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing. \nPETER \n(singing) \n\"I found a million dollar baby\u0097\" \nHe is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark, whistling its strange melody. Peter listens to it a second time, then answers its call by imitating it. The meadowlark whistles again, and peter is highly amused. \nPETER \n(waving his hand\u0097to the meadowlark) \nOkay, pal. Be seein' you. \nJust then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance. Peter glances back, and as the sirens come nearer, he pulls over to the side of the road. There follows a full view of the ROAD, with peter in the foreground at the side as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens. Thereupon PETER (seen close) gets an idea. \nPETER \n(to his Ford) \nCome on, Dobbin, old boy. We got a police escort. \nHe applies the gas and shoots out of sight, following which a full view of the road shows Peter's car trying to catch up with the parade. It outdistances him, however, and we see PETER in the Ford pressing his body forward to help the car make time. His foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor. But the police cars are now out of sight, and Peter gives up. \nPETER \n(seen close; to the car\u0097with exaggerated dramatics) \nDobbin, me lad. You failed muh. I'm afraid you're gittin' old. \nThereupon the scene dissolves to a small town ROAD, where at the door of a Sheriff's office a policeman is standing on guard. The reporters hang around in front of him. Several yokels look on. The limousine and motor cycles are at the curb. And now, in a closer view, at the DOOR the policeman on guard steps aside as the door opens and Ellie, her father, and King Westley emerge. King has his arm around her. The moment they appear in the doorway, cameras click and several reporters surround them. \nREPORTERS \nWill you make a statement Miss Andrews? Was it an exciting experience? How did you travel? \nANDREWS \n(brushing them aside) \nLater, boys, later. See her at home. \nThey cross the sidewalk\u0097to the waiting limousine, as cameras click. \nThe scene dissolves to a ROAD, with Peter still driving. He is, however, as before, in excellent form, and is singing lustily. Suddenly, however, his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake; the car screeches and moans\u0097and comes to a stop. \nPETER \nTake it easy, Dobbin. Remember your blood pressure. \nWe find Peter directly in front of a slow moving freight train. Several hoboes stick their heads out of a car, and Peter waves to them. The hoboes look puzzled for a minute and then wave back. The view then swings over to an opening between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on the other side, apparently on its way back. \nPETER amuses himself by talking to an old flagman. \nPETER \nBetter get that toy train out of here. I'm in a hurry. \nThe Flagman grins at him in reply. By this time the last car is in sight, and Peter gets all set to move. He stops, however, to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform. \nIn the meantime, the motorcycles have started forward, and the sirens begin their low, moaning wail. Peter, attracted, turns, and over Peter's shoulder we see the parade starting. As the limousine \npasses, we get a glimpse of the inside. Ellie lies back on King Westley's shoulder. He has his arm around her as they pass out of sight. Thereupon a close view of PETER shows him reacting to what he saw. He turns his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car, a look of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes. Slowly he turns his head forward, staring ahead of him blankly; he can't quite make it out. Then gradually the significance of it all strikes him\u0097and his mouth curls up bitterly. \nThe scene wiping off, a series of NEWSPAPER HEADLINES come into view: \n\"ELLEN ANDREWS RETURNS HOME.\" \n\"MARRIAGE HALTED BY FATHER TO BE RESUMED\" \n\"ELLEN ANDREWS AND AVIATOR TO HAVE CHURCH WEDDING\" \n\"LOVE TRIUMPHS AGAIN\" \n\"PARENTAL OBJECTION REMOVED IN FAVOR OF LOVERS\" \n\"CANNOT THWART LOVE SAYS FATHER OF ELLEN ANDREWS\" \n\"GLAD TO BE HOME SAYS ELLEN\" \nThis dissolves to the anteroom of a NEWSPAPER OFFICE. The place is alive with activity, and copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the Andrews story. Peter, a bewildered, stunned expression on his face, enters and crosses funereally toward Gordon's office. Several people standing around look up. \nPEOPLE \nHi, Pete\u0097Didya see this? Ellen Andrews is back. Gonna marry that Westley guy after all\u0097What a dame! What a dame! \nPeter pays no attention to any of this. He reaches Gordon's door, which is open. He walks directly past Agnes and enters the office. She looks up at him, puzzled. Then in GORDON'S OFFICE, Peter walks to Gordon's desk and lays the roll of bills on it. Agnes enters, watching him anxiously. \nAGNES \nGordon's out back some place. \nKING \n(taking his hand\u0097rising) \nYes, sir. \nANDREWS \n(dismissing him) \nFine. I'll see you at the reception. \nHe withdraws his hand, which he looks at disgustedly\u0097the result of a jellyfish handshake. \nKING \nOh, by the way, Mr Andrews, I thought of a great stunt for the reception. \n(as Andrews looks at him quizzically) \nI'm going to land on the lawn in an autogyro.[14] What do you think of that! \nA close view of ANDREWS shows him staring off at King in complete disgust. \nANDREWS \nYou thought that up all by yourself, huh? \nKING \n(unabashed) \nWhy, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that\u0097 \nANDREWS \n(hard) \nPersonally, I think it's stupid! \n(humoring a child) \nBut go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object. \nKING \nOh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space. \n(holding out his hand) \nGoodbye. \n(but Andrews turns his back on him) \nANDREWS \nWe've done that already. \nKING \n(smiling) \nYes, of course. \nHe turns and leaves; Andrews watching him go, shaking his head sadly. \nANDREWS \nAutogyro! I hope he breaks his leg. \nAndrews starts out, and the scene cuts to the HALLWAY as Andrews enters from the study. A maid coming down the stairs, he calls to her: \nANDREWS \nOh\u0097Mary\u0097 \nMARY \nYes, sir? \nANDREWS \nHow is she? \nMARY \n(hesitantly) \nWhy\u0097uh\u0097she's all right, sir. \nANDREWS \nWhat's the matter? Anything wrong? \nMARY \nOh, no, sir. No different than\u0097 \nANDREWS \nYes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? \nMARY \nYessir. If you'll excuse me, sir\u0097she sent me for a drink. \n(she leaves) \nAndrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door. \nNext Andrews enters ELLIE'S BEDROOM and looks around. The view swings around the room, following his gaze. It focuses on Ellie, who reclines on a sofa, in her bridal outfit, her head resting on the back. She stares moodily, unhappily up at the ceiling. The view then expanding to include both father and daughter, Andrews is seen staring at her a moment sympathetically. He senses something is wrong. \nANDREWS \n(after a pause) \nEllie\u0097 \nELLIE \n(jumping up with a start) \nOh, hello, Dad. \nANDREWS \n(a close view as he goes over to her) \nI knocked several times. \nELLIE \nSorry. Must have been day-dreaming. \n(to hide her confusion, she reaches for a cigarette) \nANDREWS \n(with forced lightness) \nWell, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull. \nELLIE \n(in a faraway voice) \nStunt? \nANDREWS \nLanding on the lawn in an autogyro. \nELLIE \nOh, yes. I heard. \nANDREWS \n(noting her listlessness) \nYes. Personally, I think it's silly, too. \nAs he continues talking, the view moves with Ellie, who wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares out, lost in thought. \nANDREWS' VOICE \n(he goes over the Ellie) \nYou look lovely. Are you pleased with the gown? \n(as Ellie does not seem to hear him, he becomes worried) \nEllie! \nELLIE \n(turning and looking at him blankly) \nHuh? \n(it just penetrates) \nOh\u0097the gown\u0097 \n(distantly) \nYes, it's beautiful. \nANDREWS \n(she shrugs futilely) \nANDREWS \nWell, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off? \nELLIE \nNo, I'll go through with it. \nANDREWS \nBut that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why\u0097 \nELLIE \nIt doesn't matter. \n(tired) \nI don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you\u0097made your life so miserable\u0097and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember. \nA close-up of ANDREWS shows him watching Ellie, as her voice continues. \nELLIE'S VOICE \nI've got to settle down. It really doesn't matter how\u0097or where\u0097or with whom. \nANDREWS \n(seriously\u0097impressed) \nYou've changed, Ellie. \nELLIE \n(seen with Andrews; sighing) \nYes, I guess I have. \n(sincerely) \nI don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous. \n(she shrugs resignedly) \nBesides, what difference does it make? \n(inaudibly) \nI'll never see Peter again. \nANDREWS \nIs that his name? \nELLIE \nYes. Peter Warne. \nShe starts to walk away when she is attracted by her father's surprise at the mention of the name. \nANDREWS \nPeter Warne! \n(his hand has instinctively gone to his inside pocket) \nELLIE \n(noticing this) \nWhy? Do you know him? \n(but Andrews withdraws his hand. Apparently he has changed his mind) \nANDREWS \n(evasively) \nOh, no\u0097no. \nELLIE \n(suddenly anxious) \nYou haven't heard from him, have you, Dad? \nANDREWS \n(obviously guilty) \nWhy, no . . . Don't be silly. \nELLIE \nOh, please, Dad\u0097 \nShe has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter, which she hurriedly opens and reads, following which we see a LETTER in Peter's handwriting. It is addressed to: \"Alexander Andrews, 11 Wall Street.\" It reads: \n\"Dear Sir: \nI should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with your daughter. \nPeter Warne.\" \nEllie is then seen reading and re-reading the note. Her face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete disillusionment. \nELLIE \n(her voice strident) \nLooks like that was his only interest in me. The reward. \nANDREWS \n(taking the note from her) \nI'm sorry you read it. \nELLIE \nAre you going to see him? \nANDREWS \nI suppose so. \nELLIE \n(hard) \nCertainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets. \nShe paces agitatedly, Andrews watching her silently. He knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be. Mary now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table. \nELLIE \nThanks, Mary. That's just what I need. \n(she pours herself a cocktail) \nMARY \nMr. King Westley is on his way up. \nELLIE \nFine\u0097Fine! Have him come in. \nANDREWS \n(mumbling) \nI'll be going. \n(he goes out behind Mary) \nEllie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters. \nELLIE \n(upon seeing him) \nWell, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King. \nA close view of the Two shows King taking her in his arms. \nKING \nHow are you, Ellie? \n(he gives her a kiss, which she accepts perfunctorily\u0097but he insists upon being ardent) \nAre you happy? \nELLIE \n(releasing herself) \nHappy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. \n(handing him a drink) \nHere you are, King. Let's drink. \n(she holds her glass out) \nLet's drink to us . \nYes, I know\u0097but\u0097 \nPETER \nWhat's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars! \nANDREWS \nLet me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars? \nPETER \nWhat ten thousand? \nANDREWS \nThe reward. \nPETER \n(sharply) \nWho said anything about a reward! \nANDREWS \n(smiling) \nI'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for\u0097 \nPETER \n(impatiently) \nAll I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters. \nANDREWS \nYou're a peculiar chap. \nPETER \n(irritably) \nWe'll go into that some other time. \nANDREWS \nThe average man would go after the reward. All you seem to\u0097 \nPETER \nListen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. \n(he burns at the thought) \nWhen somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. \nANDREWS \nYou were taken for a buggy ride? \nPETER \nYeah\u0097with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it? \nA close-up indicates that ANDREWS has been studying Peter throughout the scene. He is now completely won over. \nANDREWS \n(smiling) \nCertainly. \n(he opens a checkbook and writes it out) \nWhile Andrews writes, Peter wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt. Andrews rises and goes to him. \nANDREWS \nHere you are. \n(as Peter takes the check) \nDo you mind if I ask you something frankly? \n(Peter just looks at him without responding) \nDo you love my daughter? \nPETER \n(evasively, while folding the check) \nA guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined. \nANDREWS \nThat's an evasion. \nPETER \n(putting the check into a wallet) \nShe grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! \n(pocketing wallet) \nWhat she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day\u0097whether it's coming to her or not. \nA close view of the TWO shows Andrews smiling: Here is a man! \nPETER \nIf you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself\u0097long ago. \nANDREWS \nDo you love her? \nPETER \n(going for his hat as he replies) \nA normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. \n(going to the door) \nShe's my idea of nothing! \nANDREWS \nI asked you a question. Do you love her? \nPETER \n(snapping it out) \nYes! \n(as Andrews smiles) \nBut don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself. \nHe snaps the door open and goes out, following which ANDREWS is seen watching the door, his eyes twinkling, and the scene cuts to the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY as Peter comes through, moving on to the front door. But just as he reaches it, Ellie enters, accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in her hand. They see each other almost simultaneously, and both stop, glaring. \nPETER \n(looking her over contemptuously) \nPerfect! Now you look natural. \nAt this Ellie leaves her group and comes toward Peter, and a close view shows them together, glaring at each other. \nELLIE \n(icily) \nI hope you got your money. \nPETER \nYou bet I did. \nELLIE \nCongratulations. \nPETER \nSame to you. \nELLIE \nWhy don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely. \nPETER \nI would. But I've got a weak stomach. \nHe wheels around and goes through the door, Ellie looking after him, her eyes blazing. The drone of a plane motor outside is heard, and several people rush down the stairs, all excited. \nGUESTS \nHere comes King! He's just coming down! Hurry up, everybody! Come on, Ellie! \nImmediately there is a general excitement, as guests hurry through the hallway on the way to the lawn. But Ellen does not move\u0097she remains staring blankly at the door through which Peter went until Andrews enters from his study. \nANDREWS \n", "test1_input": "(muttering) \nMost humiliating thing ever happened to me. \n(shuddering) \nA bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car! That crowd outside the justice of the peace\u0097must have thought I was a criminal\u0097or something. \nA close view of ANDREWS intercuts with part of Ellie's speech. At the end of her speech he smacks his lips, enjoying the food with too great a relish. Then the two are seen together. \nELLIE \n(after a pause\u0097strongly) \nWhere are you taking me? \nANDREWS \n(carelessly) \nSouth America. \nELLIE \n(aghast) \nSouth America! \nANDREWS \nWe leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard. \nELLIE \n(threateningly) \nYou'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat. \nANDREWS \n(buttering bread) \nIn that event, we won't need so many supplies. \nELLIE \n(exasperated) \nWhat do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married! \nANDREWS \nI'll get it annulled. \nELLIE \nYou'll never do it! You can't do it! \nANDREWS \n(now seen close as he speaks between snatches of food) \nI'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it\u0097if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were. \n(he smacks his lips) \nMmm\u0097mmm. This filet mignon is divine! \nELLIE \n(seen with her father) \nWhat've you got against King Westley? \nANDREWS \nNothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all. \nELLIE \nYou only met him once . \nANDREWS \nThat was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup? \nELLIE \nYou talk as if he were a gigolo\u0097or something. \nANDREWS \n(rising\u0097reaching for ketchup) \nNever mind\u0097I'll get it myself. \n(he falls back in his chair) \nGigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks. \nELLIE \n(seen closer now, with Andrews) \nHe's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan. \nANDREWS \nYou're going to finance him, I suppose. \nELLIE \nWhy not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men\u0097particularly if you're a shining example. \nHe grins, not at all offended, knowing she doesn't mean it. \nELLIE \nYour whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing. \nANDREWS \n(unequivocally) \nHe's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to. \nELLIE \n(strongly) \nYou've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. \n(screaming) \nI'm sick of it! \nAnd as Andrews ignores her, she starts moving around the table toward him.\u0097Next she appears sitting on the edge of Andrews' chair, and she throws her arm around his shoulder. \nELLIE \n(pleading sweetly) \nAw, listen, Dad. Let's not fight like this any more. I know you're worried about me\u0097and want me to be happy. And I love you for it. But please try to understand. You're not being fair, darling. This isn't just a crazy impulse of mine. King and I talked about it a lot before we decided to get married. Look\u0097why can't we give it a trial\u0097let's say\u0097for a year or so. If it's wrong, King and I will be the first to know it. We can get a divorce, can't we? Now, be a dear, and let me off the boat. Keeping me prisoner like this is so silly. \nAndrews has been listening silently throughout the speech, giving no indication of his feelings in the matter. \nANDREWS \n(unimpressed) \nYou'll be set free when the marriage is annulled. \nA close-up of ELLIE, her eyes blazing angrily, shows her slowly edging away from her father, while he continues. \nANDREWS' VOICE \n(carelessly) \nSo there's no use being a stubborn idiot. \nELLIE \n(hissing) \nI come from a long line of stubborn idiots! \nANDREWS \n(again seen with her; calmly) \nA time will come when you'll thank me for this. \nELLIE \n(wildly) \nI won't thank you! I'll never thank you! \nANDREWS \nPlease don't shout. \nELLIE \nI'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to. \nANDREWS \n(reaching for it) \n", "test1_true": "He is about to insert the first bite in his mouth when Ellie, her temper vanishing completely, overturns the small serving table, dumping its contents into her father's lap. The movement is so unexpected that Andrews, the fork still suspended near his mouth, stares at her stupefied. Then realizing what she has done, his eyes flash in anger. Dropping his fork, he rises and goes over to her, while she stands facing him defiantly. Without a word or warning, he slaps her a stinging blow across the cheek. For a moment she doesn't stir, her eyes widening in surprise, and staring at him unbelievingly. Then turning abruptly she bolts out of the door. Andrews remains motionless, his eyes shutting painfully; it is the first time he has struck her, and it hurts. \nANDREWS \n(calling) \nEllie! \n(and he starts for the door) \nNext on the DECK, at the open cabin door, Andrews is seen, staring off at something and an amazed, frightened look comes into his eyes. Then, as viewed from his position at the cabin door, Ellie appears standing on the rail; and with a professional dive, she leaps into the water. \nA full view of the DECK reveals the crew and the officers scurrying around, several of them shouting: \"Somebody overboard!\" \nANDREWS \nIt's my daughter! Go after her. \nCAPTAIN \n(shouting) \nLower the boats! \nGeneral excitement reigns; several of the crew dive into the water; others release the boat lines. Following this Ellie is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves. Next she appears as a small speck in the distance, while half a dozen of the crew are swimming in pursuit. \nAt the SIDE OF THE YACHT one of the boats has already been lowered, and two men jump in and grab the oars. The men seem to be gaining on Ellie. In the distance several small motor boats are anchored, and over the sides of the boats their owners are fishing. Ellie seems to be headed in their direction. \nOne of the motor boats appears closer. A middle-aged man sits on the stern, holding lazily to his line, his feet dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the turbulent waves. ELLIE is then again seen swimming. She looks back, and the next scene shows the men rowing toward her, and gaining on her. Thereupon we see Ellie ducking under the water. \nThe middle-aged fisherman is suddenly startled by Ellie's face which appears from under water, right between his legs. Ellie puts her finger up to her lips, warning him to shush, and he is too dumb-founded to say anything. As the pursuing boats come near, Ellie ducks under the water again and the boats scoot right by the fisherman. Then Ellie's head bobs up; she peers ahead of her, and seeing that her pursuers have passed her, she smiles victoriously. \nELLIE \n(to the fisherman) \nThanks. \n(and she starts swimming toward shore) \nThe scene dissolves to the DECK of the YACHT as Ellie's pursuers clamber aboard, Andrews waiting for them. \nA MAN \nSorry, sir. She got away. \nANDREWS \n(disappointed but proud) \nOf course she got away\u0097too smart for you. \nCAPTAIN \nWhat a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls. \n(murmuring) \nThey're terrible! \nANDREWS \n(resentfully) \nTerrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants. \n(smiling) \nShe's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money. \nCAPTAIN \nWhat about that diamond wrist watch she had on\u0097she can raise some money on that? \nANDREWS \n(his face falling) \nHoly Smoke! I forgot all about that. \n(to the officer by his side) \nSend a wireless at once, \"Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads\u0097all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!\" \nOFFICER \nYessir. \nThe view draws in to afford a close-up of ANDREWS staring out at the sea, his face wreathed in a broad smile; then this fades out. \nPart Two \nThe RAILROAD STATION of an active terminal in Miami fades in. The view moves down to the entrance gate to the trains, passengers hur- \nrying through it; then picks out two men, obviously detectives, who have their eyes peeled on everyone passing through. Then the view affords a glimpse of ELLIE, who stands watching the detectives. This scene wiping off, we see an AIR TRANSPORT, with several planes tuning up in the background. As passengers file through, several detectives stand around in a watchful pose. This scene wiping off, the front of a WESTERN UNION OFFICE comes into view. Several people walk in and out. At the side of the door, two detectives are on the lookout. \nThis scene also wipes off, revealing the WAITING ROOM of a BUS STATION. Over the ticket window there is a sign reading \"BUY BUS TICKETS HERE,\" and a line forms in front of it. Here too there are two detectives. \nFIRST DETECTIVE \nWe're wastin' our time. Can you picture Ellie Andrews ridin' on a bus? \nSECOND DETECTIVE \nI told the old man it was the bunk. \nThe view moves from them to ELLIE, who stands behind a post and is watching the two detectives apprehensively. As the two (viewed from her position) stand by the ticket window, one of them turns toward her. Thereupon, we see her slipping behind a post, concealing herself. Just then a little old lady approaches her. \nOLD LADY \nHere's your ticket, ma'am. \nELLIE \nOh, thank you. Thank you very much. \n(she takes the ticket and change from the old lady, and hands her a bill) \nHere. \nOLD LADY \nOh, thank you. Thank you. \nELLIE \nWhen does the bus leave? \nOLD LADY \nIn about fifteen minutes. \nELLIE \nThank you. \nShe picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurries away. She crosses to the entrance of the waiting room and disappears through the doors. The view then wings over to a telephone booth near the entrance. Clustered around the booth are half a dozen men of varied appearance. The inside of the booth is lighted, and a young man, Peter Warne, waves his hands wildly as he shouts into the phone, although it is impossible to hear what he is saying. A close inspection of the men surrounding the booth (the scene contracting to a close view) reveals them as being slightly and happily intoxicated. A short man approaches the door of the booth. \nSHORTY \nHey, what's going on here? I'd like to use that phone. \nFIRST MAN \n(a reporter) \nShh! Quiet. This is history in the making. \nSHORTY \nWhat? \nFIRST MAN \nThere's a man biting a dog in there. \nSECOND MAN \n(drunker than the rest) \nAtta-boy, Petey, old boy! Atta-boy!\u0097 \nPETER'S VOICE \nI'm not going to stand for this any longer. In a pig's eye, you will!\u0097 \nGROUP \nIs that so? That's telling him, Petey old boy. \nA close view of PETER WARNE in the telephone booth gives evidence of his having also imbibed freely. \nPETER \n(shouting into the phone) \nListen, monkey-face\u0097when you fired me, you fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had. \nAnd the scene cuts to a New York NEWSPAPER OFFICE where the night editor, Gordon, his sleeves rolled up, sits at his desk shrieking into the phone. \nGORDON \nSay, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants. \n(listening) \nYeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department. \nPETER \n", "test2_input": "(again seen close at the phone) \nThat was free verse, you gashouse palooka! \nGORDON \n(at the phone in the newspaper office) \nFree verse, huh? \n(shouting) \nWhat the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more. \nPETER \n(in his phone booth) \nThat's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve. \n(after a pause) \nYeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that\u0097 \nGORDON \n(in his office) \nWhen you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. \n(at this point, Gordon's secretary enters) \nSECRETARY \nMr. Gordon\u0097 \nGORDON \n(looking up) \nHuh? \nSECRETARY \nDid you know he reversed the charges on that call? \nGORDON \nWhat! \n(into the phone) \nSay, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office\u0097unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. \n(he bangs down the receiver viciously and glowers at the phone) \nIn the PHONE BOOTH Peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him. But he goes right on for the benefit of the boys. \nPETER \n(into the dead phone) \nOh, so you're changing your tune, eh? Well, it's about time. But it's going to do you no good, my tough friend. It's a little too late for apologies. I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees! I hope this is a lesson to you! \nHe snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged pride, following which the view expands to include his public. \nMEN \nAtta-boy, Peter. That's telling him, Peter. \nThe gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he talked to the boss as Peter staggers out of the booth. \nPETER \nGive me any of his lip, will he? Huh! I guess he knows now what I think of his job! \n(expansively) \nIs my chariot ready? \nFIRST MAN \nYour chariot awaiteth withouteth, oh mighty King. \nMEN \nMake way for the King. Long live the King. Make way. \nWith head held high, he struts majestically out of sight, followed by his admirers, following which the scene dissolves to the BUS STATION. His inebriated admirers stand around the entrance to a bus, while Peter stands on the steps, his suitcase in his hand. \nPETER \n(making a grand speech) \nThat's right, my friends. Cling to your jobs! Remain slaves the rest of your lives! Scum of the earth! Newspaper men! Not me! When I'm basking in the glorious arms of the Muse\u0097what'll you be doing? Chasing news. You miserable worms. For what? A mere pittance! My heart goes out to you. \n(with arms extended and in tremolo voice) \nGood-bye. \n(and with this he turns his back and enters the bus) \nMEN \n(in the same spirit) \nGoodbye, Oh mighty King! Peace be with you, Courageous One! \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE \nAll aboard. Philadelphia, New York. All aboard. \nGROUP \nLook out. Get back. Farewell. Farewell. \nPETER \nScram. \nThe scene cuts to the INTERIOR of the BUS as viewed from the front, the view moving forward, passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats. Every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable, which adds to their uninviting appearance. Mothers cling to crying babies. A Swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey. A surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes. The moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers. \nStanding before the seat is Peter, his suitcase in his hand, speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers. \nPETER \n(calling) \nHey, driver! How about clearing this stuff away! \nSeveral passengers (seen from his position in the back) crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder. Through a glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute instructions from a superintendent, who stands on the running board, their voices in- \ndistinguishable. In answer to Peter's request, the driver glances back indifferently, and continues talking to the superintendent. A close view of PETER shows him arching his eyebrows, an amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver. He drops his suitcase and starts forward. Then we see him arriving at the glass partition, and Peter taps playfully on the pane with his finger-nails, whereupon the driver turns and pulls the window down a few inches. \nDRIVER \n(annoyed) \nWhadda you want! \nPETER \n(pleasantly) \nIf you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat. \nDRIVER \n(irritably) \nOkay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. \n(with which remark the driver turns away from him) \nPETER \n(looking at the back of the driver's neck for a moment, then confidentially) \nJust between you and me, I never intended taking it off. \nHe wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat. En route he bestows genial smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers, and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is breastfeeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles from her lips. \nPETER \nPersonally, I was raised on a bottle. \n(as the woman looks up at him, perplexed) \nWhen I was a baby, I insisted on it. You know why? \n(as the woman stares up stupidly) \nI never liked the idea of getting cigarette ashes in my eyes. \nHe moves forward, leaving the woman unable to make head or tail of it; and assuming that he's crazy, she shrugs her shoulders and turns her attention to the baby. \nNow PETER arrives at his seat, and whistling softly, raises the window. Unhurriedly, he picks the newspaper bundles up one by one and flings them out of the window. They hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud. Thereupon a close view of the DRIVER shows him reacting violently to Peter's unprecedented cheek, and starting down from his seat. \nPETER has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles and still whistling his favorite melody, he picks up his suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead. At this point, the driver enters the side door of the bus. \nDRIVER \n(pugnaciously) \nHey, wait a minute! \nPeter, his arms holding the suitcase over his head, turns and glances at the driver, a quizzical look in his eyes. \nDRIVER \n", "test2_true": "What do you think you're doing! \nPETER \n(turning) \nHuh? \nDRIVER \n(bellowing) \nThe papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out! \nPETER \nOh\u0097the papers\u0097 \nHe slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the floor. \nPETER \n(now seen close, with the Driver) \nThat's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants. \nDRIVER \nHey, whadda you tryin' to do\u0097kid me? \nPETER \nOh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants. \nDRIVER \nWhat're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up. \nPETER \n(turning to his suitcase) \nIt's okay with me. I'm not arguing. \nDRIVER \n(pugnaciously) \nFresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. \nPETER \n(turning back to him) \nLook here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss. \nDuring his speech, Ellie enters from the rear and plunks herself into Peter's seat. Unseen by Peter, she places her small bag beside her. \nDRIVER \n(answering Peter; weakly) \nOh, yeah? \nPETER \nNow, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago. \nDRIVER \nOh, yeah? \nPETER \n(exhausted) \nYou win! \nSmiling, he turns to sit down. But the smile dies on his face when he finds his place occupied by Ellie, who stares out the window. \nPETER \n(now at close range, with Ellie) \nExcuse me, lady\u0097 \n(slowly)\u0097 \nbut that upon which you sit\u0097is mine. \nEllie glances up at him\u0097then down at her buttocks. \nELLIE \n(eyes flashing) \nI beg your pardon! \nPETER \nNow, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you\u0097 \n(gesturing with thumb) \nscram. \nELLIE \n(ignoring him\u0097calling) \nDriver! \nThe driver, who has stopped to witness this new altercation, returns. \nELLIE \nAre those seats reserved? \nDRIVER \n(pleased to discomfort Peter) \nNo. First come, first served. \nELLIE \n(dismissing the whole thing) \nThank you. \n(Peter, thwarted for a moment, just glares at her) \nPETER \n(also calling) \nDriver! \nDRIVER \nYeah? \nPETER \nThese seats accommodate two passengers, don't they? \nDRIVER \n(hating to give in) \nMaybe they do\u0097and maybe they don't. \nPeter lifts Ellie's overnight bag off the seat and drops it on the floor. Part of her coat covers the small space by her side. This he sweeps across her lap. \nPETER \nMove over, lady. This is a \"maybe they do.\" \nHe plops into the seat, the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief. Ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him. But Peter suddenly looks down toward the floor, following which a close-up AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag on the floor annoys Peter. With his foot he slowly moves it over to her, and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again. Next we see Ellie glaring at him, picking up her bag, and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead. But just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her, and she falls backward right in Peter's lap. Their noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, and they glare at each other hostilely. Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat, turning her back on him. \nPETER \n(amused) \nNext time you drop in, bring your folks. \nThis dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD, and the bus sways perilously as it speeds through the night, following which the view dissolves to the INTERIOR of the BUS, revealing Peter slumped in his seat, his hat drawn over his eyes. Ellie has her head thrown back, trying to sleep. But the swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side uncomfortably, and finally she gives up. \nELLIE \n(an order) \nTell that man not to drive so fast. \n(at which Peter just cocks his head slightly) \nPETER \nAre you talking to me? \nELLIE \nYes. Tell that man to drive slowly. \nPeter stares at her a moment, resenting her officious manner. \nPETER \n(pleasantly) \n", "test3_input": "Okay. \nAnd much to her surprise, he sighs deeply and relaxes to his former position, shutting his eyes. She glares at him crushingly. \nThe scene dissolves to another view of the BUS, disclosing the driver, and suddenly the bus comes to a stop. \nDRIVER \n(sticking his head in to face the passengers) \nRest station! Ten minutes! \nThe view draws back as some of the passengers rise. The men stretch their legs, and the women straighten out their skirts. A close view of Peter and Ellie then shows her rising. Peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass, and Ellie starts up the aisle. But she suddenly stops; looks back, first at her bag and then at Peter; decides to take her bag with her, and returns to take it. She reaches for it on the rack, Peter watching her, amused. \nThe scene dissolves to the outside of the REST STATION with several passengers walking briskly back and forth. The place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, and Peter can be seen leaning against one of these posts, smoking a cigarette. The scene moving in, a close view of Peter shows him stealing a glance in the direction of Ellie. And a view, from his angle, reveals Ellie in the shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. She slowly turns her head toward Peter and then quickly averts it. \nPETER (seen close) speculates about her. He glances around the place, and the scene moves about, following his gaze. It takes in the other passengers, all obviously poor and uncultured. The moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter reacting with comprehension: No doubt about it! She doesn't belong with these passengers. Then suddenly he sees something which startles him, and we see what it is: Directly in back of her, the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight bag from the ground and starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious of his actions. PETER springs forward. \nEllie sees Peter coming toward her and is perceptibly startled. But Peter whizzes by her, and this amazes her even more. She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, and resumes her smoking. In a few seconds Peter returns, puffing breathlessly. \nPETER \nHe got away. I suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk. \nELLIE (seen close with PETER) doesn't know what he's talking about. She looks at him, puzzled. \nELLIE \nI don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested. \nPETER \n(taken aback) \nWell\u0097of all the\u0097well\u0097 \n(hard) \nMaybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone. \nAt this, Ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where her bag had been. \nELLIE \nOh, my heavens! It's gone! \nPETER \n(sarcastically) \nYeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually. \nELLIE \nWhat happened? \nPETER \nThat cadaverous-looking yegg[2] who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run! \nELLIE \nWhat am I going to do now? \nPETER \nDon't tell me your ticket was in it? \nELLIE \n(opening her purse) \nNo, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. \nPETER \nYou can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville. \nELLIE \nWhy, no\u0097I\u0097 \n(catching herself) \nYes . . . I guess I will. \nPETER \n(starting out) \nI'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean. \nELLIE \n(quickly) \nNo. I'd rather you didn't. \nPETER \nDon't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? \nELLIE \nI don't want it reported! \nPETER \nWhy, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that\u0097 \nELLIE \n(hotly) \nSee here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported! \n(she starts away) \nPlease stay out of my affairs! I want to be left alone. \n(with which she disappears from the scene) \nA close-up of PETER shows him glaring after her. \nPETER \n(mumbling) \nWhy, you ungrateful brat! \nThe scene dissolves to the BUS, where all the passengers are scattering back to their seats; Peter is already seated, when Ellie arrives. A close view then shows her standing uncertainly for a moment, speculating whether to cross over his legs to get her place by the window. Peter feels her presence by his side and glances up. She tosses her head and plants herself in the seat in front of him, vacated by the young man who stole her bag. Peter takes the affront with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near the window. \nThe scene dissolves to a close view of Ellie and a recently arrived fat man next to her. She has her head thrown back in an effort to sleep, but the fat man, his hands clasped over his protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies him. Suddenly the bus careens, the fat man falls against Ellie, and she awakens with a start and pushes him back. The fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few seconds the procedure is repeated, and Ellie is beside herself. She looks around for somewhere to flee. \nPETER, seated in back of her, in his customary slumped position, opens his eyes slightly. It is apparent he has been watching her for some time, for he grins at her discomfiture. Ellie's head turns in his direction and the grin leaves Peter's face. He shuts his eyes and pretends to be asleep. Ellie glances at Peter to make certain he is asleep. The fat man falls against her again and it is all she can stand. She starts to rise. Peter sees her coming and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him, still pretending to be asleep. Just as Ellie starts to sit, she notices his hand and is embarrassed. Gingerly she picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee. She then slides into the seat, sighing with relief, whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is amused. Slowly his head turns\u0097and he scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly. Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse of Peter\u0097and is startled to find him gazing at her. She turns forward, her jaw set forbiddingly. \nThe scene dissolves to the view of a ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, against the horizon, the bus, a mere speck, makes its lone way over the deserted country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, reading \"JACKSONVILLE,\" and then into the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE and PETER. They are both asleep, her head resting comfortably on his shoulder, Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then the view draws back. The bus is empty except for Ellie and Peter, the last few passengers are just leaving. \nPETER's eyes slowly open. He looks down at the head on his shoulder and grins. With a sigh, he shuts his eyes again and resumes his slumber. Next, at the front of the bus, the DRIVER stands staring at Peter and Ellie in this intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly. \nDRIVER \n(murmuring) \nOh, yeah? \nELLIE stirs, squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shifts her position. Just as she settles down, her eyes open. She stares out of the window with unseeing eyes, and then closes them \ndreamily, giving the impression that, still half conscious, she is trying to recall where she is. Apparently she does, for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head. Finally (in a scene including Peter), Ellie realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder, whereupon she straightens up, embarrassed. \nELLIE \nOh, I'm sorry\u0097 \n(feebly smiling) \nSilly, isn't it? \nShe looks around, and her finding herself alone with Peter adds to her embarrassment. \nELLIE \nEverybody's gone. \nShe lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious of his coat over her which slips. She stares at it thoughtfully for a moment\u0097then at Peter. \nELLIE \n(realizing that he put it there) \nOh, thank you. \n(she hands him his coat; ill at ease) \nWe're in Jacksonville, aren't we? \nPETER \nYes. \nELLIE \n(nervously) \nThat was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away? \nPETER \nI hated to wake you up. \n", "test3_true": "How about some breakfast? \nELLIE \nNo, thank you. \n(she rises, anxious to get away) \nThank you so much. \nMost uncomfortably, she edges away from him toward the front of the bus, Peter watching her leave, his interest definitely provoked. \nThe scene cuts to the STAND as Ellie emerges from the bus. At the foot of the steps is the driver. \nELLIE \nHow much time have I? \nDRIVER \nAbout a half hour. \nELLIE \nI'm going over to the Windsor Hotel. \nPeter appears in the door of the bus in the background, and a close view then shows him stopping to listen as he sees Ellie talking to the driver. \nDRIVER'S VOICE \nThe Windsor! You'll never make it in time. \nELLIE'S VOICE \nYou'll have to wait for me. \nDRIVER'S VOICE \n(aghast) \nWait for you! \nA smile flits across Peter's face; then a wider view shows Ellie leaving the driver. \nELLIE \n(as she goes) \nYes. I may be a few minutes late. \nShe disappears from sight, leaving the driver staring at her, dumbly; and Peter, standing in back of the driver, shakes his head in amazement. \nThe scene dissolves to the BUS STAND later that morning\u0097at the same spot where the bus had previously been. It is no longer there, however. A huge crowd fills the space, and the view moving down through the crowd, singles Ellie out. She has just arrived and looks around helplessly. Finally she spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him. \nELLIE \n(now next to the Guard) \nWhere's the bus to New York? \nGUARD \nLeft twenty minutes ago. \nELLIE \nWhy, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus\u0097I told them to wait! \nGUARD \nSorry, Miss. It's gone. \n(and he turns his back on her) \nEllie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie. \nPETER \nGood morning. \nPeter is in the foreground, the guard is seen in the background. Ellie stares at Peter, perplexed. \nPETER \nRemember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night. \nELLIE \nSeems to me I've already thanked you for that. \n(turning to guard) \nWhat time is the next bus to New York? \nGUARD \n(turning) \nEight o'clock tonight. \nELLIE \nEight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours! \nGUARD \nSorry, Miss. \nThe Guard leaves the scene, and Ellie's disappointment is apparent. \nPETER \n(sarcastically) \nWhat's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? \n(Ellie glares at him, disdaining to reply\u0097this angers him, and he continues hotly) \nSay, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian. \nELLIE \n(starting away) \nWhat are you excited about? You missed the bus, too. \nPeter looks at her a moment before replying. \nPETER \n(quietly) \nYeah. I missed it, too. \nThere is a close view of the two. She turns to him. Her interest is provoked by his tone of voice. She glances up into his face. \nELLIE \nDon't tell me you did it on my account! \n(pause) \nI hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is\u0097 \n(she interrupts herself) \nYou needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself. \nPETER \nYou're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. \n(he reaches in his pocket) \nHere's your ticket. \nELLIE \n(surprised) \nMy ticket? \nPETER \nI found it on the seat. \nELLIE \n(taking it) \nOh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket. \nWhile she is putting the ticket away in her purse, Peter speaks: \nPETER \nYou'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. \n(this is a shock to Ellie) \nELLIE \n(weakly) \nWhat are you talking about? \nPETER \nJust a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team. \n"}

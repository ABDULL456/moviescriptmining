{"train": "FRACTURE \nWritten by \nDan Pyne \nCurrent Revisions by \nGlenn Gers \nJanuary 6, 2005 \nCREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors. THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt. Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange. He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device. His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball - - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg- style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles - - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table. Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball. He stays still, analyzing. He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal- working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint. Drops in another ball. It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down. Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine. Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid-30s. His wife. \nINT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME \nJENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm - - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish. They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls off her - slowly coming back to earth. Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face - - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear. She is, after all, having an affair. \nINT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nCrawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless. \nHe takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands, removing the glasses. \nWe now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip. \nCrawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom. \nHe gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk. \nHe collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card. \nHe puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby. Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal. \nTINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway. \nTINA The N.T.S.B. guys are here. \nCRAWFORD (Doesn't look up) Yep. \nShe hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle. Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and grabbing his jacket - - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk, liquor spilling. Crawford just walks out past Tina. \nINT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER \nThe twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor. \nN.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site. They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this is not a man who skips a shave. But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it: \nCRAWFORD It's here. \nHe hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield. His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford doesn't slow or look back. \nINT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER \nRob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit. \nROB What about dinner tonight? \nShe looks at him, surprised.    Smiles, comes to sit beside him. Gently: \nJENNIFER We go out to dinner - we might never come back. \nCRAWFORD I could use a hug. Jennifer submits guiltily.   Crawford embraces her, tight. She waits it out, until: \nJENNIFER Have you been drinking? He lets go and she steps back.   Studying him.   Scared. \nCRAWFORD I've been watching you sleep.   At night. \nJENNIFER (Gently) That's creepy. \nCRAWFORD Sometimes when I'm at work, I'll start thinking about you and I'll just get - just - overwhelmed. \nJENNIFER Tommy - \nCRAWFORD It's a dense, crushing - geophysical force. Like I'm pinned. At the core - where things change. (beat) You ever get that way about me, Jen? \nJENNIFER What are you talking about? \nCRAWFORD I'm trying to describe my feelings. \nJENNIFER Those don't sound like feelings. \nCRAWFORD No? (Beat) What's the sound of one feeling...in a forest? \nJENNIFER You think you're so much smarter than I am. That must make you feel very powerful. \nCRAWFORD Helpless, actually. Silence. \nJENNIFER Okay.     Maybe it's time to really talk. \nCRAWFORD No. \nJENNIFER No? He shakes his head.     Frayed and worn, she sighs. \nJENNIFER Fine. Whatever. I'll make you some dinner. He watches her turn and head for the kitchen.          To her back: \nCRAWFORD I know.     Everything. She stops, exhales.    Looking down.   Afraid.    Grateful it's happening at last. \nJENNIFER I'm so sorry. \nCRAWFORD Don't be. Knowledge is pain.         I'm used to that. Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy.     Preparing herself to turn and end it, to grow, to move on. \nCRAWFORD It's not like I don't let little pleasures, in return for the pain. \nShe frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear. Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her face. Very still. The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud. \nEXT. GIFFORD HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS \nGifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCrawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove. He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way to Jennifer. He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open. The doorbell rings. \nEXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nGifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door - hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in. \nGIFFORD Tom?   Jen?   Everything okay in there? \nINT. CRAWFORD FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nCrawford steps in from the living room. \nWILLY (Enjoying, mock-helpless) It's what the man told me to call him. \nGLADYS You're gonna need to pick out a style, Willy. \nWILLY A style. \nGLADYS For the tuxedo. Willy hesitates, in over his head.   A DDA helpfully does the Travolta finger-in-the-air pose. \nWILLY I don't know - I just don't want to look like I'm going to the prom. \nGLADYS You wanna go Classic.    Fix him up. \nMONA We'll get you something Classic. (Picks up a ringing phone) Willy Slocum's office. \nNORMAN Make sure it comes with cuff-links and knee-pads. \nWILLY Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be back in high school. \nMONA (Hanging up) Willy? Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn. \nMONA God wants to see you. \nWILLY (Beat) Our God? \nMONA Who art on the Eleventh Floor. Willy, startled, looks around. Approving nods, raised eyebrows. He tightens his tie and heads for the elevators. \nNORMAN There is no justice! There is no justice in the city of Los Angeles! \nINT. LOBRUTO'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER \nDistrict Attorney JOE LOBRUTO, 50-ish, sits behind a massive oak desk, studying a thick file. Doesn't look up as a SECRETARY shows Willy in. Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags, wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in. \nLOBRUTO William No-Middle-Initial Slocum. \nWILLY Yes sir. \nLOBRUTO Sit. (As Willy does:) Eighty-four-percent conviction rate. That's remarkable. \nWILLY Thank you. \nLOBRUTO With a case load thirty percent higher than any other first-year DDA. (Beat) Of course - you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together. Willy considers his options.   He always does. \nWILLY I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. They couldn't handle their workloads, and I prefer not to lose. Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it. \nLOBRUTO You're going to need a middle initial. \nWILLY Sir? \nLOBRUTO You're going to Wooton Sims. \nWILLY In two weeks. \nLOBRUTO You'll be able to afford a better suit. But those guys all play squash and have middle names. They go in for the mother's maiden name a lot. Beat. Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but the only way it shows is how calm he stays. \nWILLY My mother didn't have a maiden name. Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm. \nLOBRUTO So you're a bastard; sometimes I can be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong here. \nWILLY I didn't work this hard to stay where I belong. \nLOBRUTO You're a street-fighter, Willy. You should be in court. We can move you up to better cases. \nWILLY Okay. \nNIKKI Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance. But: you get to work on legendary litigation. National, sometimes global, in scope. It's high- stakes. And cut-throat - even within the team. We burn out associates at an astonishing rate. \nWILLY You're trying to scare me. \nNIKKI Yes. \nWILLY You're going to have to try harder. She stops walking.   Studying Willy. \nNIKKI Can I ask you something personal? \nWILLY Sure. \nNIKKI Who are you? Willy doesn't answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe not wanting her to know. Or even not knowing, himself. \nNIKKI We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. - which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it. Against you. Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired one - says you're on my team. Willy weighs his options.    Decides to level: \nWILLY It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton. (Shrugs) Bob. Beat. \nNIKKI Wow. You know what's brilliant about that? \nWILLY Yes. \nNIKKI You didn't actually do anything all that wrong. \nWILLY Well - I wasn't entirely honest with Calvin. His cell-phone rings.    He ignores it. \nNIKKI You gonna get that? \nWILLY Everyone I need to talk to is here. They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them. They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of it. But then: \nNIKKI We need to talk about your transition timetable. \nWILLY All right. \nNIKKI Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we're getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client, Armstead Pharmaceutical. \nWILLY No problem. She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands: \nNIKKI That's catch-up on three years' work - and you haven't closed out your old job yet. \nWILLY I'm good at trials.    Even by fire. Beat. \nNIKKI You know, a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have. \nWILLY I'm looking forward to when I can afford the luxury of having some. Nikki sighs, smiles.    Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly. \nNIKKI I'll have them put the Armstead materials in your new office. \nWILLY Thanks.    Boss. He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone, in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza. Then he checks his cell-phone.     Dials. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. FORENSICS LAB - LATER \nMARCHAND, Senior S.I.D. (Scene Investigation Division) Tech, works as he talks into a speaker-phone. He and Willy have teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock each other. \nMARCHAND Marchand. \nWILLY It's Willy Slocum.     What's up? \nWILLY Do I need it?! The weapon?! He takes a second.   Sighs, exasperated - but honest: \nWILLY I don't know. Probably not. Defendant's a whack-job. \nMARCHAND He went pro se, right? \nWILLY Yeah. Just when you think they're not really stupid, they defend themselves. \nMARCHAND You've got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial. (Apologetic) We've gone over this place top-to- bottom three times now, Willy. Willy takes a breath.   Thinks it through. \nWILLY Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it. (Beat) Sorry - got a lot going on. \nMARCHAND Must be rough, figuring out what you're gonna do with all that money. \nWILLY Hey, I had to sit through an opera last week. \nMARCHAND Oh gee - lemme see if I can express how much sympathy I have: Marchand snaps his phone shut. Willy smiles, hangs up. But then his smile fades, as he glances down again at Crawford's box of papers. Hundreds of pages.   Every single one scrawled NO. Willy considers them. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nMetal chairs. Bad light. Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table, waiting. Looks up as the door unlocks. A GUARD lets Willy in, locks the door behind him. Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his briefcase, set them on the table. \nCRAWFORD How's my wife? \nWILLY I don't know. \nCRAWFORD I heard somewhere, I think it was on N.P.R., that you're supposed to talk to people in a coma. Play their favorite music. Supposedly it reaches them. Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him. \nCRAWFORD You represent Jennifer. The voice of the victim, judicially speaking. But you haven't gone to see her? \nWILLY Not yet. \nCRAWFORD Too busy getting up to speed on Armstead Pharmaceutical? Beat. \nWILLY I beg your pardon? \nCRAWFORD I'm not judging you. I think anyone - coming from...what you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on the internet - my God, it must have eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand dollars in debt, eighty-four percent conviction rate: you deserve this. Willy tries to stay in control. \nWILLY What the hell have you been doing. \nCRAWFORD I'm permitted the use of a private investigator. \nWILLY Not to investigate me! \nCRAWFORD Why not?   You're investigating me. \nWILLY You shot your wife. \nCRAWFORD Allegedly. That's how it works, right? If I can't introduce something in court as evidence - it doesn't exist. Legally. \nWILLY Look - I don't want to play games with you. \nCRAWFORD I'm afraid you have to. \nBeat. Willy reconstructs his formal cool. Takes some pages scrawled NO from a folder, pushes them across the table. \nWILLY Is this some form of - communication? \nCRAWFORD You sent me a box of papers. \nWILLY It's called Discovery.       The State has a legal obliga- \nWILLY Just want to be ready for Chicago. I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last trial starts Monday. Beat.   Not pleased: \nNIKKI You've got a trial Monday? \nWILLY Yeah: attempted murder. \nNIKKI That gives you three days. You told me - and I told Bob - that you would be ready to hit the ground r- \nWILLY The man confessed.    And he's pro se. \nNIKKI Willy, some but acting as his own lawyer - he could drag it out for months! \nWILLY You want to hear his witness list? Nikki nods.   Willy is silent.     She frowns. \nNIKKI No witnesses? Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even admiring, Crawford's ploy: \nWILLY It's kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane. I think he thinks we'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense. He's acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy. Beat.   Nikki considers Willy. \nNIKKI You're gonna miss being in court, aren't you? He studies her, confident.    Gestures to the stacks of Armstead materials: \nWILLY I'm almost halfway through these. And I think I've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida. I have to check case law in each state, but it looks good. I'll get the rest done over the long weekend. Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will.      He's won her over...again. Willy shrugs, grins.    In the silence, the impossible electricity returns.    After a moment - to defuse it: \nNIKKI You don't go home for Thanksgiving? Slight beat. \nWILLY No. She studies him a moment, thoughtful.    Careful. \nNIKKI If you want - you're welcome at mine. My family's. \nWILLY Really? She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting to know Willy: \nNIKKI I think it would be interesting. Beat. \nWILLY Yeah.    Okay, thank you. \nNIKKI Cool. Beat.   She leaves.    Willy doesn't go back to work right away. \nINT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY \nJUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands in the Prosecution Table. \nUNIFORM COP We established a perimeter around the house and then waited for SWAT and the Negotiator. It was strictly by the book. \nWILLY So the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots? Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind him. He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of \"Rube Goldberg\" contraptions. \nUNIFORM COP Maybe ten minutes. \nWILLY And when you arrived at the sc- Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad.     Looks up - sees Willy, and everyone else, turned to him. \nCRAWFORD Sorry. \nWilly sighs, returns to the Cop. \nWILLY When you arrived on the scene, was there a crowd? \nUNIFORM COP Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look soon as it started. \nWILLY And from what you could ascertain, no one went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator arrived? \nUNIFORM COP Definitely not. \nWILLY Thank you.   No further questions. \nJUDGE ROBINSON Mr. Crawford - \nCRAWFORD You said layman's terms - \nWILLY Your honor - \nCRAWFORD I'm sorry - what would you call it - legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife? Utter silence. Willy whirls a look at Nunally.     The cop meets his eyes - a deer in headlights. \nWILLY (Low) Oh - shit. \nCRAWFORD I think it's objectionable - maybe I'm wrong. \nWILLY Your honor... \nJUDGE ROBINSON Detective Nunally? Nunally looks down, silent.    Shaking his head. \nCRAWFORD Rob? \nWILLY Your honor, the People request a - Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him - all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle - \n- spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking.   Chaos. \nINT. JUDGE ROBINSON'S CHAMBERS - SOON AFTER \nThe Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm. \nWILLY He had my witness list.   He should have filed to suppress. \nCRAWFORD (Shrugs) My mistake. Sorry. \nJUDGE ROBINSON Mr. Crawford, I warned you about representing yourself. \nCRAWFORD What about the fact that it's true? I mean, isn't that the point here: to get to the truth? \nJUDGE ROBINSON Mr. Slocum - is it true? \nWILLY I don't know. I only heard about it five minutes ago. \nCRAWFORD Put him back on the witness stand if you don't believe me. \nWILLY We can't put him back on now! Not after what the jury just saw. Your honor, I told you this would turn into a circus. First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation - \nCRAWFORD My Dick has evidence. The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insane. \nJUDGE ROBINSON Excuse me? \nCRAWFORD My investigator. I call him Dick. I guess I should call him as a rebuttal \n(MORE) \nCRAWFORD (cont'd) witness? He's got phone records, credit receipts, photographs, videotapes - all documenting the affair. In graphic detail. (Beat. Mildly:) Dick is good. The Judge looks at Willy.    This is bad.    Thinking fast: \nWILLY Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming ...and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial - \nJUDGE ROBINSON Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest. \nCRAWFORD Actually, while obtaining my so-called \"confession.\" Willy stares at Crawford, shaken.    Understanding the trap. \nWILLY No way.   Your honor - \nJUDGE ROBINSON He's got a point. They were alone in the house. The confession is no good. \nWILLY No. \nNIKKI Well, he pretty much has to if he's gonna save any face. So here's the strategy: you let him. Willy cautiously lifts the box's flaps - pulls aside tissue paper - to reveal: A single eggshell.   Broken, empty. \nWILLY I let him? \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nCrawford begins to smile. \nNIKKI (V.O.) Yeah, damage control. Stop getting your face on TV. As it is, I had to talk Bob down from cancelling your contract. \nINT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME \nWilly is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely listening to Nikki. \nNIKKI (CONT'D) But we've got to move fast and get out from under. Otherwise, and I quote: \"Stick a fork in this kid's ass and turn him over, he's done.\" \nWILLY I can't just - walk away. \nNIKKI Willy: today, you got killed. The issue now is saving your new life. Willy can't take his eyes off Crawford's \"gift.\" \nWILLY I guess...that would be the smart way of looking at it. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS \nCrawford stares right at us.       Smiling.   Ice cold. \nINT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME \nNikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet: \nNIKKI You want to come out and get drunk? \nWILLY No. Thank you. I've got some stuff to take care of. \nNIKKI All right.    Don't beat yourself up. \nWILLY I won't. He hangs up.    Considering the empty eggshell.       But then he looks up: District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to decide whether to be angry. \nLOBRUTO You don't look into who the victim was sleeping with? Willy burns, ashamed.       But unable to admit it. \nWILLY He - threw me off. (Frustrated) Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all radioactive. The night this went down, it was over. \nLOBRUTO But you still walked   it into court, Willy. We might not    have a case...but it didn't have to be   a public humiliation for this   office and the police department. Silence. \nWILLY Are you taking me off? \nLOBRUTO You're leaving anyway. \nWILLY I'm starting to get a sense of this guy. \nLOBRUTO That's not new evidence. \nWILLY I can take him now: he thinks he's smarter than I am. \nLOBRUTO It's not about you, Willy. \nWILLY Yeah, it is. He made it that way. (Shows him the egg) He likes me. \nLOBRUTO What is that - some kind of Oklahoma insult? \nSHERIFF'S DEPUTIES - - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture - - taking pictures down from the walls - - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the closets - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings - - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof - - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system - - taking apart the Porsche in the garage. Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER \nWilly stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke around. \nWILLY Shake the boxes. \nDEPUTY Huh? \nWILLY The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And there's a chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside. The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink.    The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay? Willy nods.   Moves on. \nEXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER \nHours have passed. \nWilly steps out of the front door, because he's going stir- crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and flower-beds with metal detectors. He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black- and-whites parked in the driveway: Nunally, in his parked car, across the street. He meets Willy's eyes.    Worried. Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away. Takes a breath, turns and goes back in to work. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK \nIt's getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry them out. The place is a disaster area. Marchand watches Willy pace the living room. \nWILLY The garage?    Washer-dryer? \nMARCHAND And the tool shed, and the roof, and the H.V.A.C. ducts. \nWILLY What about the door frames?    The floors? \nMARCHAND What did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up? \nWILLY What about the neighbors' property? He could have thrown it over the hedges. \nMARCHAND We checked. (Beat) He might have passed it off to somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back. Willy shakes his head, grim.    Pacing. \nWILLY This isn't an accomplice sort of guy. He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg device. As he moves toward it: \nWILLY This is a...guy who likes to show off. He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors. Checks Marchand - who shakes his head. \nWILLY You sure? \nMARCHAND I'm sure. Willy grimaces.   Fuming, relentless: \nWILLY It's a physical object. It can't just vanish. We're missing something - some step in the story. He begins walking through the crime, \"the stations of the cross\" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself: \nWILLY The neighbor sees her get home. He's already inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says she's standing over there - he's somewhere around here. Willy stands where Crawford was.     Raises a finger-gun. \nWILLY Boom. As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell: \nMARCHAND But then he carries her back there. Why? Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood: \nWILLY Because he's gonna need time. To confess. When she's alone with the cop. Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers. \nMARCHAND Neighbor comes to the door. Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer: \nWILLY Crawford shouts, \"Leave us alone\" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom- boom. \nMARCHAND So everybody knows he's dangerous - and she might still be alive. \nWILLY So they'll call the Negotiator. (Beat) Now he's got about ten minutes. And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford. He can't. \nMARCHAND I'm sorry, Willy. Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means admitting he's got nothing left. \nWILLY That's how it works with the law. \nRESIDENT I knew I should have gone to law school. Willy watches the Resident go out. Then he looks back down at Jennifer. Listening to the machines. \nINT. CRAWFORD OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY \nWilly wanders.   Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway. He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing expedition. \nWILLY So this is all exactly how he left it. \nTINA Yes. Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites, universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates, articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft. \nWILLY And he was - distraught. \nTINA He was drinking. The past few weeks. \nWILLY But he was working on this. He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device.   Tools laid out on the work table - meticulous, organized. \nWILLY All distraught and everything. It's not evidence. \nTINA Do you want coffee.    He said I should ask. Willy turns, a little rattled.    Beat. \nWILLY Tell him I said no thank you. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nThe room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now, anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it. There's nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past the ASSISTANT MANAGER waiting in the doorway. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nAs Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling. \nWILLY How long do you keep the tapes? \nASSISTANT MANAGER A month. Willy considers it.     He's got nothing else to try. \nWILLY Can I get a copy of October 9th? \nASSISTANT MANAGER I'll have it for you Friday. \nWILLY I'm kind of under the gun here. \nASSISTANT MANAGER We're short-staffed tonight and tomorrow. Beat.   Seeing Willy's confusion: \nASSISTANT MANAGER Thanksgiving? Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn't forgotten: \nWILLY Right.   Okay. \nINT. GARDNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER \nA faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but lived in. JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart- type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table, wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children. Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she's dressed \"casual.\" \nGARDNER White or dark, Willy? \nWILLY Anything is fine, your honor. \nGARDNER I'm off-duty, you can call me Lew. While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it: \nWILLY So - is everyone in this family involved in the law? \nSANDRA Well, Nikki's not. \nWILLY Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win?! \nNIKKI Who cares?! Win what? \nWILLY The man shot his - \nNIKKI You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to play in the big leagues?! \nWILLY Yeah, I'm just - \nNIKKI You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh- \nWILLY Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk about this here?! Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food: \nNIKKI Fine. \nWILLY Thank you. Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down her napkin: \nNIKKI I need to talk with you. She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her. \nEXT. GARDNER HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nWILLY Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you - \nNIKKI Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him - \nWILLY Wouldn't it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around? \nNIKKI And what if you don't? Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over his head. Desperate to get through: \nNIKKI You don't get it at all, do you?! You pulled a stunt to get yourself this job. Fine: you're a hot-shot! (Beat) Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots. Because you don't win. The firm wins. Bob wins. \n(MORE) \nNIKKI (cont'd) (Beat) And you just put yourself head-to-head in conflict with Bob. Silence.   Shaken: \nWILLY What am I supposed to do? \nNIKKI We told the man you're getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday. Painful silence. \nWILLY Yeah.   Okay. Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger. \nWILLY I think maybe I'm gonna go now. \nNIKKI All right. (Beat) Call if you want. He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously from the dining room - breaking the spell. Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause. \nWILLY I've got some work to do. I need to call a cab. Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet. Studying the torn-up young man. \nGARDNER You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work? Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy's heart. We're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it doesn't get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it's hard to beat when you actually get to do it. \nWilly looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised. Gardner shrugs: my two cents.      He goes to a side-table, finds the Yellow Pages. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEmpty.   Dark.   Willy lets himself in. He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it. Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters. He can't get any other pre-sets to work. The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange. Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the French doors to the garden. Goes over - - and jumps back, startled - \nWILLY Shit! - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass. Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard. \nWILLY The hell are you doing here? Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it. \nNUNALLY We need to talk. He drinks, then offers the bottle.     Willy hesitates, takes it. As he drinks: \nWilly stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon. \"Walking the scene\" again, on paper. The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked-up depositions. He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred times. He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell - - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper - throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk - - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in his chair. There's a knock on the door. Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m.   He goes to open it - - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to Jennifer Crawford. \nNUNALLY It's done. In the tool shed: taped to the blade, inside the lawn-mower. Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away. Willy doesn't move.   Watching the tormented cop disappear down the alley. \nINT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - BULLPEN - THE NEXT MORNING \nWilly - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way to his own execution. At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him. Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a messenger-receipt taped to the front. \nINT. WILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nMona watches Willy shut the door behind her. \nMONA You okay? \nWILLY Yeah.  Maybe. (Hesitates) Can I ask you to do something for me this morning? \nMONA Sure. \nWILLY Write down your cell number. (As she does) Once my trial is in session, wait outside. I might call - and just hang up. If I do, I want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon. \nMONA You found it? Beat. \nWILLY I haven't decided yet. Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell, hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful. Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand. \nMONA Oh: this came for you. He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address: Wooton Sims. Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton Sims stationery: We only win the favor of the Gods by making a sacrifice See you tomorrow - Nikki He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the note. \nINT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nWilly steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND SPECTATORS outside the courtroom. He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow performer - - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions, avoiding eye contact - - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes fixed on Willy. Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing. Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter which way this goes. \nINT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER \nMr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand.   Willy questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table. Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS, SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front. Lobruto, standing at the back. Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with dense scribble. \nWILLY So - between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911, and the time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you had the Crawford house in view? \nGIFFORD Yes. I was very concerned about Jennifer. She was a lovely woman. \nWILLY No one but Thomas Crawford came in or out? \nGIFFORD That's correct. \nWILLY Thank you, Mr. Gifford.    No further questions. \nJUDGE ROBINSON Mr. Crawford? Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if he's just noticed him up there. Beat. Without getting up: \nCRAWFORD Did you see the guy run out the back door? \nGIFFORD What...\"guy\"? \nCRAWFORD The other guy. The one who shot my wife. Did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun? Willy closes his eyes.   Gifford grimaces. \nGIFFORD I couldn't see the back of the house. (Trying to salvage it:) I believe...the police went around back when they arrived. \nCRAWFORD No further questions. Willy immediately stands: \nWILLY Re-direct, your honor. But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages: \nCRAWFORD I've also written a motion to dismiss. \nWILLY Objection - I'm on re-direct! The Judge hesitates.   Both men standing. \nWILLY The point?! Willy stares. Because she's drawn a line in the sand. One he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now he's standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away under his feet. \nWILLY This man is going to kill his wife. \nNIKKI Yeah. (Beat) What does that have to do with Wooton Sims? Willy just breathes.   Vulnerable like we have never seen him before. He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the team of associates. Some look away. \nNIKKI I warned you. \nWILLY No, this is insane. \nNIKKI It's what it is. \nDing!   The elevator.    Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad: \nNIKKI I warned you. She starts for the elevators, Willy following - \nWILLY You're not really just gonna let this happen, are you?! \nNIKKI Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over your problems?! \nWILLY My problems?! Wait a second - this is not about my anything any more - Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes - - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls for help - - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator.     The Associate holding the doors lets them go. \nWILLY This is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman's life! The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from pity to contempt - - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger. As the doors shut across them. Willy doesn't move.     Confused, humiliated, frustrated. He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind the glass doors. Beat.   Willy holds up his palms. \nWILLY Don't bother.     I got it. \nHe bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting off the fire alarms as he stalks out. \nINT. WOOTON SIMS - BUILDING STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER \nWilly runs down the stairs furiously - - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little fainter. He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over.    He sways, dizzy, gasping - - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing. Scared out of his mind. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK \nCrawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a metal clipboard. DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR wait. The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive. Crawford signs the forms, expressionless. \nEXT. COURTHOUSE - THE SAME TIME \nWilly's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the building. The Judge is wearing his \"civilian clothes.\" \nJUDGE ROBINSON What do the doctors say? \nWILLY People wake up out of these things. \nJUDGE ROBINSON What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum? \nWILLY They said...there's no way to really know. I'm trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there, and I'm telling you. \nJUDGE ROBINSON I'm sorry. I have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he's protected agai- \nWILLY \nWHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?!   WHAT'S \nPROTECTING HER?! The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic, but yelling at me is not a smart approach. Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds. The Judge watches him go.   Grimaces. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING \nCrawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal. Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system. He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses, folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He picks them up. Stylish, feminine. He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the lid, and drops the glasses in. Goes back to cooking. \nINT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nWilly brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a DRIVER wrangling with the BOOTH GUY. He grimaces, looks around - - backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDr. Lunt stands by Jennifer's bed, supervising the Nurse and an Orderly as they prepare her. \nINT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nCrawford walks in, goes toward the elevators. \nINT. WILLY'S CAR - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS \nHe floors it, racing under a light going red - narrowly misses getting broad-sided. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDr. Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer's chart, as Crawford enters the room. \nEXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nWilly pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette - \nWILLY Move it if you need to! - running through the automatic doors. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nStanding beside Dr. Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless - - as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent, disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor - \nINT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SOON AFTER \nWilly dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open. Too crowded. \nINT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER \nWilly gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs - \nINT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER \n- comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward I.C.U. - \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n- and into Jennifer's room, where he stops.     Shocked. The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out. Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed. \nNURSE You just missed her. \nWILLY What? \nNURSE She just went on up. Willy struggles to control his emotions.     Looks down. \nWILLY How long ago...did she die? \nNURSE What? (Beat) The roof. (Beat) \n(MORE) \nNURSE (cont'd) Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term care facility up in Santa Barbara. They just left, you can probably still catch 'em. Willy tries to understand her.   With growing horror. \nWILLY He's - moving her by helicopter? \nNURSE Nothing but the best. We hear the surge of a jet engine - - as Willy runs out of the room. \nWILLY He is!   You have to get us DOWN! \nPILOT Get back in your goddamn seat! \nCRAWFORD Willy, I'm not doing anything. Everyone can see that. \nWILLY I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK! He's DOING SOMETH- An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator. Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it - \nWILLY What's happening?! \nMED TECH I don't know - I'm - there's a - malfunction - - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his glare: oh, you bastard. Crawford almost smiles. \nThe Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires - \nMED TECH I can't do anything with this, up here. The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes Jennifer's breathing tube and prepares to begin C.P.R. - \nCRAWFORD She's D.N.R. The Med Tech looks up - startled.     Confused. \nWILLY What is it? \nCRAWFORD Check. Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his paperwork, searching it - \nWILLY What? The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared. \nMED TECH She's Do Not Resuscitate. Willy turns on Crawford.   He shrugs. \nCRAWFORD It's in her living will. The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed. \nMED TECH She's D.N.R.    She signed it. \nWILLY There's a restraining order - she's protected - I'm authorizing you to do it! The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain - \nCRAWFORD No extraordinary measures. (Turns to Willy) Unless your court order specifies \n(MORE) \nCRAWFORD (cont'd) contravening her living will. But I don't think it would. I think you got one that forbids me from disconn- Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med Tech grabs him, drags him back - \nPILOT \nWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?! - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's stretcher - Willy struggles furiously - \nWILLY Wait!    WAIT - LOOK! Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked - - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent: She's breathing. \nWILLY Yes.     Yes. Willy whirls around to Crawford.        Who's frowning. \nWILLY You messed up. With all your plans and games. Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of her face. Her eyes flutter open - \nWILLY Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right. - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand.        Silent awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear. \nWILLY You're gonna be okay? She squeezes his hand.      Very weakly. Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch. Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.        She fights it. \nWILLY Jennifer?       Hang on. Something sad in her wordless gaze.        As it starts to fade. \nWILLY Jennifer?!     JENNIFER?! She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty.        Her hand becoming lifeless in his. \nWILLY No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back. Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them - feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction. \nWILLY Don't let go. But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes her eyes. Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically. \nCRAWFORD You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have to be here. (Beat) But now you're my witness. You saw: I didn't touch anything, I didn't do anything. The machine went down. Anybody asks - you'll have to tell them. What you saw. (Beat) That's really kind of perfect, isn't it? Willy stares into his eyes. Cold.        Then he looks away.    Out the window, into the sun-glare. \nWILLY You don't want to know. \nLOBRUTO Willy, you can't - \nWILLY I don't work for you. (Beat) Right? Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back to the garage. With work to do. \nLOBRUTO Don't do anything crazy. \nWILLY What else have we got left? Willy disappears inside. \nINT. S.I.D. LAB - LATER \nEnd of the day. Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his computer. He turns to go - - Willy is standing in his doorway. \nWILLY I need a favor. \nINT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER \nWilly follows an EVIDENCE CLERK along an aisle between floor- to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers. \nCRAWFORD These are from that thing at the courthouse, right? \nWILLY Uh-huh. The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in his hand - pulls down a box for Willy. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THAT NIGHT \nCrawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and parts laid out precisely on a table. Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal - \n- when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair hurled in from the backyard smashing through it. Crawford stands, taking off the glasses - - as Willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying Nunally's gun. \nCRAWFORD Very dramatic. Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall. \nWILLY You ain't seen nothin' yet. He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to Crawford. \nWILLY I want the gun. \nCRAWFORD Why?   You've already got one. \nWILLY I want the gun you shot your wife with. Now. Crawford doesn't move. Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face. \nWILLY One way or another, I'm going to see to it you receive justice tonight. Crawford studies Willy. \nCRAWFORD You're serious, aren't you. \nWILLY Oh, yes. \nCRAWFORD (A smile dawning) Willy. You got religion, didn't you?! You care. That's...priceless. He laughs.   Willy keeps the gun aimed at him. \nCRAWFORD No, it's very sweet. Really. \nWILLY Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute. Crawford nods.    Considering the game.   Unruffled. \nCRAWFORD Getting it like this: is that going to hold up in court? \nWILLY I don't work for the D.A. any more. I'm just a guy who broke into your house. When the police arrest me - they'll inventory anything in my possession. If that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky. Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of the gun between them. \nCRAWFORD It takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone's eyes and pull the trigger. It takes a unique kind of strength. \nWILLY I guess you'd know that. \nCRAWFORD Yes.    I would. Willy cocks the gun. Crawford shakes his head.    Eyes on Willy. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly looks at Crawford.    Stunned. \nWILLY You took his gun. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCrawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds Nunally's badge, holster and gun. \nWILLY (V.O.) And you left him yours. Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol, which was tucked into the back of his belt. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nBeat.   Crawford shrugs - arrogant: \nCRAWFORD I gave it back. \nWILLY Yes you did. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK) \nCrawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom - \nWILLY (V.O.) After you'd used it. Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer - \nWILLY (V.O.) Then you told Nunally you'd put it down - if he put down his. Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly turns, looking into the alcove: \nWILLY That's why you moved her back there - \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK) \nNunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked, frantic - \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) The truth is I could have done it right in front of the man and he wouldn't have noticed. - ignoring Crawford behind him. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nCRAWFORD He had...other things on his mind. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nNunally's calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately starting C.P.R. - - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon, (Nunally's gun) from the table - - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's gun (from his holster). \nWILLY (V.O.) And all you had to do was switch the guns back - in the commotion - Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the chair in its place. \nWILLY (V.O.) - and then wait - He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will be mistaken for the murder weapon. Straightens, done. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACKS) \nNunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset, distracted - puts it in his holster - \nWILLY (V.O.) - until Nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house. A Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag - - as Nunally walks out. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly stares at Crawford.    In real wonder. \n", "test1_input": "CRAWFORD We both put down our guns.      At the same time. Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer door, near Nunally. \nCRAWFORD We set them down and step away. (Beat) Then you can \"pay more attention\" to what I'm saying. Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room. \nCRAWFORD Happy ending, then. Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster. Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns - - and step away.   Crawford smiles. Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still. \nNUNALLY Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife - \nCRAWFORD It's Tom. \nNUNALLY I'm sorry? \nCRAWFORD You can call me Tom. \nNUNALLY Tom.   Your wife. Is she here? \nCRAWFORD Yes. Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view. \nNUNALLY Is she all right? Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see. \nCRAWFORD I don't think she is.     I shot her, Rob. Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove - \nNUNALLY You shot your wife. \nCRAWFORD It was like I just suddenly - snapped. We were arguing - and I got the gun. \nNUNALLY - okay - I hear you - \nCRAWFORD And I shot her in the head.   I know it was wrong. (Beat) Are you listening to me? But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove - which he can now see. There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of Jennifer Crawford. \nNUNALLY Oh Jesus Christ. Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford toward the alcove - - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle - \nNUNALLY (into walkie-talkie) We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW! Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign - \nNUNALLY Oh no - God no - I can't - get a - Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody. He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then - - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind Nunally. Cold. \nCRAWFORD You know, I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It's on the inner surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress - \nNunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally - - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating Crawford furiously, cursing - - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back - knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer - - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put face-down on the floor, to get cuffed. Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry - going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder- holster, struggling to regain control. \nPARAMEDIC Wait a second - she's not dead! Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling silent. The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work - - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations. \nEXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER \nJennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on - - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away, carrying his wife. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER \nA DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag. Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken. \nSWAT COMMANDER You all right? Nunally \"wakes\" - nods.   Absently: \nNUNALLY Yeah.     I'm good. To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and chaos outside. \nFADE OUT \nINT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING \nThe alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic - - but the narrow futon bed is already empty. WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College. He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment. \nTIME CUT The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves. The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar. \n", "test1_true": "Willy savors the moment. Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door - - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something. Willy grimaces.   Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall. \nWILLY Mrs. Demello? (Beat) MRS. DEMELLO!    Your CAR! Silence. He sighs.    Shuts the door and presses a button near the light-switch. There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves. He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door. \nEXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS \nWilly straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door. As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz. \nWILLY (V.O.) Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy, and you start looking to take advantage? \nINT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING \nAn ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone: \nWILLY I'm not knocking it down to a Class C. My backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a \"golfing accident\"? Your client owns one golf club and no golf \n(MORE) \nWILLY (cont'd) balls - and the \"accident\" took place in the stairway of an illegal after- hours gambling club. Yeah, okay - I'll see you in court. His cell phone rings.   As he gets it: \nWILLY Well, I won't see you in court, but someone from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go. (switching phones) Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes. Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the door open without looking: \nNORMAN Wooton Sims?! Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell: \nWILLY No, I didn't.     Wow.   Okay. Norman mouths \"WOOTON SIMS?!\" repeatedly during: \nWILLY No - short notice is...fine. No, I can. Black tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her. He hangs up, exhales slowly.    Looks at Norman. \nNORMAN Wooton - SIMS?! Wooton Sims?! \nWILLY Please stop saying, \"Wooton Sims\" over and over. It's starting to sound like nonsense words. \nNORMAN You asshole! \nWILLY Okay: go back to \"Wooton Sims.\" As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman - \nNORMAN How the hell did you get a job at Wooton Sims?! I can't even get an interview! \nINT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nNorman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS work: MONA and GLADYS. \nNORMAN I've been here five years. I'm your supervisor. I graduated USC, summa! \nWILLY We're just going to pretend he's not talking, okay? \nMONA                            NORMAN No problem.                     I'm serious. \nWILLY I'm really jammed-up all day, and I need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight. \nNORMAN A tuxedo?! Oh, come on!     You are so full of shit. \nWILLY (Jotting notes) There must be a place that does that, right - same day? I'm also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my suit size and my shirt size...I really appreciate this. Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card. Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks. \nMONA What's going on? \nWILLY Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of this committee - \nNORMAN \"Bob\" Wooton?! \n", "test1_id": 1836, "test2_input": "BAILIFF The State of California Versus Thomas Crawford. The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore into him, haunted and burning. Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file. \nJUDGE Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder, with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07. (Beat) Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights? \nP.D.                              CRAWFORD (sotto)                    I do.     But, your honor - You do. \nJUDGE FELDMAN And do you wish to enter a plea at this time? \nCRAWFORD Not guilty. But I also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself. Willy looks up from the file - startled. \nJUDGE FELDMAN Do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford? \nCRAWFORD No. I just want to do it myself.     I believe it's within my rights. \nP.D. Your honor, if I could have a moment with my client - \nCRAWFORD I'm not your client. Try and keep up, would you? The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy. \nJUDGE FELDMAN Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr. Slocum? Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze. Shakes it off: \nWILLY I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea. Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip- on. \nCrawford nods: you're welcome.    Willy turns to the Judge. \nWILLY I - can't - this was supposed to be - with a pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and I'm not even going to be here. The People request a continuance to - \nCRAWFORD Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial. (To Willy) Does that help? \nJUDGE You don't need to look out for Mr. Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case - \nCRAWFORD No, I like Mr. Slocum. Beat. \nJUDGE FELDMAN Mr. Slocum?   He likes you. \nWILLY Terrific. \nJUDGE FELDMAN Mr. Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities. \nWILLY All due respect, your honor, I'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus - \nJUDGE FELDMAN I appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum - considering you're making the argument dressed as a game-show host. Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else. (turning) \n(MORE) \nJUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd) As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly urge you to retain counsel. Lack of same will not be grounds for appeal. \nCRAWFORD I understand.     Thank you. \nJUDGE FELDMAN Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing? Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again. Checks Crawford - waiting, polite. \nWILLY Sure.   Why not. Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar. \nINT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER \nWilly, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops.   Rob Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car. \nNUNALLY You're supposed to be good. Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner. \nWILLY Is that what I'm supposed to be? \nNUNALLY I asked around. You're supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one. \n", "test2_true": "NUNALLY I took Crawford's confession. \nWILLY And now you want mine? \nNUNALLY I'm here to warn you. Take this seriously, because it's serious. This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying in a hospital bed - with brain damage... He struggles to keep himself under control. \nWILLY Are you all right? \nNUNALLY Are you gonna be on this, or what? \nWILLY Yeah.  I'm on it. (Gently) You got a confession. You took the gun out of his hand. It's done. \nNUNALLY I'm just - telling you. Is that okay? Or are you too friggin' busy?! \nWILLY No.   It's okay. Willy waits.    Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons. \nNUNALLY Forget it. (Beat) It's a lock. We're good.   Put him down. Bury him. Willy nods.    Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp. Willy watches him go. Sad. Like he's watching Nunally drown. But he's seen people drown before...and he's not about to put out a hand. Might get pulled in himself. \nINT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER \nWilly moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE. NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her. \nNIKKI Are you a shark? \nWILLY Sorry? \nNIKKI You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die. \nWILLY If I stopped, I'd be standing around with no one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief. \nNIKKI Why don't you talk to Bob? Willy stops walking, getting a little careful. \nWILLY \"Bob\" is talking to the Governor. (Beat) Do I know you? She puts a hand out, gently amused. \nNIKKI Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate, Wooton Sims. \nWILLY (Shakes) Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that called, with the invitation. \nNIKKI On Bob's orders. \nWILLY Listen, I don't...actually know \"Bob.\" I mean, I've only met the man once. Nikki nods, considering this.      And him. \nNIKKI Interesting. They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction. The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. As the CROWD begins to drift toward the auditorium doors: \nNIKKI You like opera? \nWILLY Truth is, I haven't really had that much expos- \nNIKKI Neither do I. With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza doors. Willy follows. \nEXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER \nThey stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines. \nNIKKI Bob assigned you to my team. I'll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you. \nWILLY Kind of like a mentor. \nNIKKI Kind of like a probation officer. Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make sure he's got it. \n", "test2_id": 1837, "test3_input": "- into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in the crowd - - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered around a figure lying on the floor. Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of: Nunally.   Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless fingers.   Blood all over, from his head. Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur. \nThen suddenly Willy looks up - as if he's been called - - to find Crawford, standing very still, in the crowd, on the other side of the body. Everyone else is moving, talking, gawking at the body or averting their eyes - - except Crawford.   He's looking straight at Willy. Pleased.   Triumphant. Willy stares into Crawford's eyes. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT \nThe life support system clicks and hisses and beeps. Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes and wires. Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the jacket off, the tie loose. He's been there a while.   But now he speaks. \nWILLY Your husband said something...that I can't seem to shake loose of. He said I'm a winner. (Beat) And he's right. I can't lose. I can't stand people who lose. (Beat) I may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and...people like you - that maybe I messed up. I don't know if did anything wrong. Or what I should have done. I really don't know, any more...what I'm supposed to do. (Beat) But I feel like I let you down. Somehow in the...process. And if I did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just - I hope you...have...just, some... (Beat) Anyway. He feels stupid. Takes a breath.     Looking at her pale, drawn, comatose face. He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Gets his briefcase. \nHe goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back. Freezes. Jennifer's eyes are wide open. She's staring at him.   Willy stands, breathless, watching her. \nINT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER \nSliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident from the other night: \nWILLY She was looking at me. \nRESIDENT Yeah, I understand - \nWILLY No, she was looking at me. \nCLOSE UP - JENNIFER'S EYEBALL A beam of light slides across it. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin from his lapel. Gently sticks Jennifer's cheek. Willy winces, watching. \nWILLY She's reacting. The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin - her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot. It arches up. \nWILLY You see? \nRESIDENT The normal reflex goes downward.   Up indicates brain trauma. \nWILLY She's in there. She was looking at me. \nThe Resident sighs.   Sympathetic, but plain: \nRESIDENT Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut. They all move - they make sounds, they twitch. You think they're dreaming. But they're not. It's just what's left of the system, sending broken signals. \nWILLY Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I. or something? And I want a coma specialist to see her. \nRESIDENT You're not authorized to order tes- \nWILLY I'll get you authorization.      First thing tomorrow. The Resident studies Willy.   Reluctantly: \nRESIDENT You get the paperwork, I'll do what I can. Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits by Jennifer's bed - protective, intent. \nINT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING \nCrawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed.   A free man. He slows, surprised - - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his briefcase from the courthouse. \nCRAWFORD Mr. Slocum. \nWILLY Just...visiting. \nCRAWFORD This isn't like you at all. \nWILLY No? \nCRAWFORD You haven't got anything to gain. \n", "test3_true": "CRAWFORD Of course I have. (Leans in) The truth about me is, Willy...I'm really not very nice. Willy nods.    Concealing the ace up his sleeve. \nWILLY You sure do know a lot, though. Got everybody all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. Then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. Must be kind of...boring. At that point. \nCRAWFORD Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy? (Beat) Imagine it - imagine she was yours. And you knew you were losing her. (beat) Imagine days. Weeks. Going through her desk. Her purse. Her closet. Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her shoes. Knowing this is what it will be like. After. (beat) Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her - every day, knowing? \nWILLY But you had to, right? You needed time to set it all up...your \"crime of passion.\" \nCRAWFORD There are many kinds of passion, Willy. \nWILLY Yeah.  There are. (Beat) So - thank you. Crawford frowns.     Starting to feel wary.   Willy sees it. Enjoys it. \nWILLY For sharing your wisdom. All your little helpful bits of information. (Beat) You were right. \nCRAWFORD About...? \nWILLY Talking to her. Beat.   Willy winks.    He goes past Crawford and out the doors. Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy. Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him. \nINT. WOOTON SIMS - RECEPTION - LATER THAT MORNING \nWilly - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST: \nWILLY Hi, I'm just - - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double- doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls the handle - - but it stays locked.     Willy swipes his card again.   No go. \nWILLY Excuse me - I'm new, I just started - and there's something wrong with my card. Can you buzz me in? \nRECEPTIONIST Who are you here to see? \nWILLY I work here.    Willy Slocum.    I'm new - He stops, realizing how he must look. \nWILLY Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for Nikki Gardner. As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON. They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton - who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older. \nWILLY Wait a second - never mind, here she is, thank you. Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through - nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic: \nWILLY Hey...Bob - (To Nikki) Can I talk to you for a second? Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long. She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators - staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy: \nWILLY You let him know what happened last night? \nNIKKI I told him. \nWILLY Great - who do I work with on it while you're gone? \nNIKKI You don't work with anyone. \nWILLY Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants. If we don't move fast - Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear: \nNIKKI Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over! What is wrong with you - it's first year law: that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it \n(MORE) \nNIKKI (cont'd) wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy! You can't take him back into court! \nWILLY I told you - we bring a civil suit - \nNIKKI You've got no standing. \nWILLY It doesn't have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug! With all the brain-power here, I'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor. Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight him on - \nNIKKI What's the point, Willy? \n", "test3_id": 1838}

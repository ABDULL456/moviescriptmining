{"test1_input": "SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES - - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture - - taking pictures down from the walls - - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the closets - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings - - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof - - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system - - taking apart the Porsche in the garage. Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER \nWilly stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke around. \nWILLY Shake the boxes. \nDEPUTY Huh? \nWILLY The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And there's a chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside. The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink.    The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay? Willy nods.   Moves on. \nEXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER \nHours have passed. \nWilly steps out of the front door, because he's going stir- crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and flower-beds with metal detectors. He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black- and-whites parked in the driveway: Nunally, in his parked car, across the street. He meets Willy's eyes.    Worried. Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away. Takes a breath, turns and goes back in to work. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK \nIt's getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry them out. The place is a disaster area. Marchand watches Willy pace the living room. \nWILLY The garage?    Washer-dryer? \nMARCHAND And the tool shed, and the roof, and the H.V.A.C. ducts. \nWILLY What about the door frames?    The floors? \nMARCHAND What did he do: rip open a door frame, hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up? \nWILLY What about the neighbors' property? He could have thrown it over the hedges. \nMARCHAND We checked. (Beat) He might have passed it off to somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back. Willy shakes his head, grim.    Pacing. \nWILLY This isn't an accomplice sort of guy. He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg device. As he moves toward it: \nWILLY This is a...guy who likes to show off. He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors. Checks Marchand - who shakes his head. \nWILLY You sure? \nMARCHAND I'm sure. Willy grimaces.   Fuming, relentless: \nWILLY It's a physical object. It can't just vanish. We're missing something - some step in the story. He begins walking through the crime, \"the stations of the cross\" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door, methodical, reciting it to himself: \nWILLY The neighbor sees her get home. He's already inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says she's standing over there - he's somewhere around here. Willy stands where Crawford was.     Raises a finger-gun. \nWILLY Boom. As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell: \nMARCHAND But then he carries her back there. Why? Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood: \nWILLY Because he's gonna need time. To confess. When she's alone with the cop. Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood, the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers. \nMARCHAND Neighbor comes to the door. Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer: \nWILLY Crawford shouts, \"Leave us alone\" and fires three more rounds: boom-boom- boom. \nMARCHAND So everybody knows he's dangerous - and she might still be alive. \nWILLY So they'll call the Negotiator. (Beat) Now he's got about ten minutes. And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford. He can't. \nMARCHAND I'm sorry, Willy. Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means admitting he's got nothing left. \n", "test1_true": "It's night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he leaves. \nWILLY (V.O.) Do you dare stay out? Do you dare go in? Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford - in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal when they're together. \nWILLY (V.O.) And IF you go in - Should you turn left or right? Or right and three-quarters? Or maybe not quite. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - SOON AFTER \nChecking the contents of the medicine cabinet. \nWILLY (V.O.) You can get so confused that you'll start in to race, Down long wiggled roads at break- necking pace No longer really looking for the gun.   He's looking for insight. Contact. A way in. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER \nWilly wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room. \nWILLY (V.O.) And grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, Headed I fear, toward a most useless place. He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin- care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs. \nWILLY (V.O.) The Waiting Place... For people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go Or a bus to come, or a plane to go Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the search. He shifts the lid aside. \nWILLY (V.O.) Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow A high-school yearbook. An old photo album. A teddy bear. A snow-globe. A well-worn book by Dr. Seuss. \nWILLY (V.O.) Or waiting around for a Yes or No Or waiting for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting. Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life. \nINT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT \nThe room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor. \nWILLY (V.O.) Waiting for the fish to bite Or waiting for wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle Jake Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape. Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss: \nWILLY Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants Or a wig with curls... Or Another Chance. He stops reading a moment.   Watching her: \nRESIDENT (O.S.) What are you doing? Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past him to check the I.V.'s and monitors. He's about Willy's age. \nWILLY I heard it might - help - if somebody talked to her. \nRESIDENT Who told you that? \nWILLY (Reluctantly) The man who shot her. The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable. \nWILLY Is there any chance...she might come out of this? \nRESIDENT Are you a member of the family? \nWILLY (Getting out ID) Sorry. I'm with the District Attorney's office. (Beat) We don't have any other witnesses. \nRESIDENT This woman had a bullet plow through her brain. \nWILLY I know. But you hear about people waking up from comas. After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up. (Beat) You hear stuff like that all the time. \nRESIDENT You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too. All the time. \nWILLY It's not impossible, though. Is it? I mean - why else are you keeping her like this? Beat.   The Resident sighs. \nRESIDENT No. It's not impossible. But even if she did, she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how she was shot. \nWILLY When I was here alone before, she moved a little. \nRESIDENT Are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want? Beat. \n", "test1_id": 1836, "test2_input": "WILLY Did it ever occur to you I might be good enough to still win?! \nNIKKI Who cares?! Win what? \nWILLY The man shot his - \nNIKKI You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to play in the big leagues?! \nWILLY Yeah, I'm just - \nNIKKI You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh- \nWILLY Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk about this here?! Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food: \nNIKKI Fine. \nWILLY Thank you. Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down her napkin: \nNIKKI I need to talk with you. She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her. \nEXT. GARDNER HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nWILLY Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you - \nNIKKI Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him - \nWILLY Wouldn't it be better than damage control if I actually turn it around? \nNIKKI And what if you don't? Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over his head. Desperate to get through: \nNIKKI You don't get it at all, do you?! You pulled a stunt to get yourself this job. Fine: you're a hot-shot! (Beat) Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots. Because you don't win. The firm wins. Bob wins. \n(MORE) \nNIKKI (cont'd) (Beat) And you just put yourself head-to-head in conflict with Bob. Silence.   Shaken: \nWILLY What am I supposed to do? \nNIKKI We told the man you're getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday. Painful silence. \nWILLY Yeah.   Okay. Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger. \nWILLY I think maybe I'm gonna go now. \nNIKKI All right. (Beat) Call if you want. He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously from the dining room - breaking the spell. Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause. \nWILLY I've got some work to do. I need to call a cab. Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet. Studying the torn-up young man. \nGARDNER You know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work? Now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy's heart. We're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it doesn't get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it's hard to beat when you actually get to do it. \nWilly looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised. Gardner shrugs: my two cents.      He goes to a side-table, finds the Yellow Pages. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEmpty.   Dark.   Willy lets himself in. He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it. Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters. He can't get any other pre-sets to work. The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange. Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the French doors to the garden. Goes over - - and jumps back, startled - \nWILLY Shit! - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass. Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard. \nWILLY The hell are you doing here? Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket, uncapping it. \nNUNALLY We need to talk. He drinks, then offers the bottle.     Willy hesitates, takes it. As he drinks: \n", "test2_true": "WILLY Thank you, Professor Einstein. It would also be good to find a couple of \n(MORE) \nWILLY (cont'd) eyewitnesses. If one could be the Dalai Lama, it would be even better. \nNUNALLY No - Willy: we need to find the gun. \nWILLY I've had three different teams here - \nNUNALLY He didn't leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs. The gun is here. (beat) So we have to find it. \nWILLY Well - we can't! You want to move on? Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat - - Willy catches it.       A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter in a plastic bag. Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a bullet, deformed by impact. \nNUNALLY There's a guy in the Evidence Room, owes me a favor. Well - it's not so much a favor as I know stuff about him. He can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer, give us a ballistic match. Beat. \nWILLY It's a crime. \nNUNALLY So who's gonna get away with a crime - this asshole, or us? Willy sighs.    Tosses the gun back. \nWILLY Go home. \nNUNALLY What else have you got?! \nWILLY I'll find a way. \nBeat. \nNUNALLY No you won't. Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely- lit room. The front door opens, and slams. A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath.       Gets to work. He still has three days to break this open. Walking through the crime again. Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places, getting different perspectives. Willy stands in the alcove.    Looking around. There's something here.     But he can't get it. His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device.       Moves closer, peering into the mechanism. Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on the coffee table. Hide in plain sight. He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around. Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand. Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot. The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected - - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails across the living room - - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table. Willy grimaces.   This guy is really good. \nINT. MARCHAND'S OFFICE - S.I.D. - SUNDAY AFTERNOON \nA mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists, depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and coffee cups. \nMarchand surveys it.    The bleary end of a long day - sifting clues, dead-ends. \nMARCHAND Willy.     There's nothing here. Willy has barely slept all weekend. He shakes his head, reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a VCR/TV, stubborn. \nWILLY Guns don't just walk out of crime scenes. Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally doing his job, his methods, his routine. \nMARCHAND Two months before he shot his wife, this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work. He knew exactly how it would go down - and he didn't leave any loose ends. \nWILLY Then what is this: Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white: Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on fast-forward - - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in. \nWILLY Hotel surveillance.     From that day. He was there. Why? Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder.    Shrugs. \nMARCHAND Had to see it for himself. \nWILLY See what?     They were out at the pool. \nMARCHAND The unmade bed. Her panties. Man's gonna shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up. Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging from the room, walking away down the corridor. Unconvinced: \nWILLY Yeah.     Worked up. Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on. \nMARCHAND Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life, and you forget all about this one. (Hoping to get a smile:) And then you can lend me money and shit. Willy says nothing.    Runs the tape back and then slow-motions it forward again. Marchand goes out.    Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 1837, "test3_input": "INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly looks at Crawford.    Stunned. \nWILLY You took his gun. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCrawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds Nunally's badge, holster and gun. \nWILLY (V.O.) And you left him yours. Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol, which was tucked into the back of his belt. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nBeat.   Crawford shrugs - arrogant: \nCRAWFORD I gave it back. \nWILLY Yes you did. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK) \nCrawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom - \nWILLY (V.O.) After you'd used it. Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer - \nWILLY (V.O.) Then you told Nunally you'd put it down - if he put down his. Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly turns, looking into the alcove: \nWILLY That's why you moved her back there - \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK) \nNunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked, frantic - \nCRAWFORD (V.O.) The truth is I could have done it right in front of the man and he wouldn't have noticed. - ignoring Crawford behind him. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nCRAWFORD He had...other things on his mind. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nNunally's calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately starting C.P.R. - - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon, (Nunally's gun) from the table - - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's gun (from his holster). \nWILLY (V.O.) And all you had to do was switch the guns back - in the commotion - Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the chair in its place. \nWILLY (V.O.) - and then wait - He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will be mistaken for the murder weapon. Straightens, done. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACKS) \nNunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset, distracted - puts it in his holster - \nWILLY (V.O.) - until Nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house. A Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag - - as Nunally walks out. \nINT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME) \nWilly stares at Crawford.    In real wonder. \n", "test3_true": "CRAWFORD You know, this is really kind of fun. It's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter. Willy looks down at the gun in his hand.    Thoughtful. \nWILLY This caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life. \nCRAWFORD It's still not evidence, Willy. There's no prints left by now. Nothing ties that gun to me. Willy smiles, slow...    Enjoying himself, at last. \nWILLY No. That would be true.        Except for all those eggs. \nCRAWFORD Those what? Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball- bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg machine: \nWILLY With all those little cracks and weak places. Like Nunally. Shooting himself, right there in the courthouse. I didn't think he was going to do that. Did you? \nCRAWFORD (Wary) No. Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford: \nWILLY I mean, we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later. That was part of your plan, right? Like a bank shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife - and destroy her lover. With one bullet. (Turns) Well: four bullets, actually. Right? Crawford frowns.   Trying to see what Willy's getting at. \nWILLY First bullet goes into your wife. \nINTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS: Crawford fires at Jennifer - \nWILLY (V.O.) Then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention. - and fires three times at the transom. \nWILLY Then while you're waiting for the show to begin - you have to reload Nunally's gun. \nCrawford pushes new bullets into the clip - \nWILLY (V.O.) I mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night. \n- and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased. Willy nods, thinking it out.   Sure of himself. He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the machine - \nWILLY And I'm betting you didn't worry about fingerprints. \nCrawford reacts. CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip. Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks. \nWILLY I mean, why would you? Nobody's going to be looking at his gun. \nThe ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery - \nWILLY And sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever. \n- and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake. The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor, through the crowd. \nWILLY (V.O.) Except Nunally only fired one of those bullets. Into himself. \nWilly turns from the machine - - which continues clattering and working, beside him. \nWILLY Which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them - Tom. In this clip. \nHe holds the gun up.     Savoring Crawford's growing fear. They can hear a car rolling up the driveway. Red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door. \nWILLY Everybody has a weak spot, right? Some place they break. \nWithout looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor - - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc - - that misses the bowl. \nOutside, the police car doors open and then slam. Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee-table and across the floor toward him. Crawford doesn't move.     Trying to focus.    His mind working. The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe. The doorbell rings. \nCrawford looks up.     Meeting Willy's eyes. Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air. And gives Crawford a wink. Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes - - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door. \nTHE END \n", "test3_id": 1838}

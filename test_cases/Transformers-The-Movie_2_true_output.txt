He takes off. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Stays behind, taking a few shots at... 
SWEEPS which streak over in deadly formations. 
ULTRA MAGNUS He stands and shoots. 
SPRINGER (O.S.) Ultra Magnus! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Ultra Magnus turns to see... 
THE OTHER AUTOBOTS 
several yards down the junk-lined corridor. 
PERCEPTOR (O.S.) Your estimated survival time is 10 seconds. 
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
He shoots at the junk walls. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Then use that time to escape! The Matrix was designed for an emergency like this. I'll try to unleash its power. 
SPRINGER But what if it doesn't work. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Until all are one! 
THE OTHER AUTOBOTS AND JUNK WALLS 
Ultra Magnus' ray hits the walls and they tumble down, separating him from the other Autobots. 
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
His back to a wall of fallen junk, he pulls out the matrix. 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON IN CYCLONUS 
Galvatron pops out of Cyclonus and both transform, to land in front of Ultra Magnus. 
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
Struggling to open the leadership matrix. He puts his hand inside of it and gets a powerful shock! He pulls his hand out quickly. 
ULTRA MAGNUS Damn it!   Open it! 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON 
He laughs. 
ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
He still struggles. 
ULTRA MAGNUS (baffled) Prime, you said the Matrix would light our darkest hour. 
ANGLE ON GALVATRON 
Four sweeps fly TOWARD CAMERA in formation.    Galvatron pops out a communication device from his helmet. 
GALVATRON Sweeps, quarter him! 
ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS - TRACKING 
Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and... 
ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
wrap around his arms and legs. 
ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS 
His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's just about had it. He struggles for one last moment, then... 
ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS 
Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot leader... 
ON ULTRA MAGNUS 
As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered in the distance, he SCREAMS IN HORROR. 
ULTRA MAGNUS (SCREAMS IN HORROR) 
ANGLE ON THE MATRIX 
It tumbles from Ultra Magnus' hands to... ... Galvatron's hands!

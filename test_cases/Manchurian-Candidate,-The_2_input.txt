MARCO 
Yeah.   Kinda like 'special agent.' 
COLONEL GARRET 
Cut it out, Major. 
AGENT GOLDRING 
What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw? 
AGENT RAMIREZ 
Man of his dreams. 
MARCO 
Listen, you might want to advise your ME to check for an implant in Corporal Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy of the scapula, left side ... if he's not looking for it, he won't find it. Implant.   The Feds just stare at him.   Like he's nuts. 
MARCO 
I didn't have anything to do with Corporal Melvin's death. 
AGENT JONAS 
Yeah, well, that's your opinion, but judging from your file here, apparently you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend -- Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas -- Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two men -- pull them apart -- 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
(re: Jonas) Get this man out of here. 
AGENT JONAS 
(taunting Marco) Go ahead, nutball. Try it. Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the floor between the other two. 
AGENT JONAS 
-- He hit me! Fuck! 
MARCO 
He said I could. Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the middle of the fracas, while -- 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Okay, OKAY --! That's enough. Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major Marco. Now. The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold- cocked colleague, door slamming behind them. 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
Evidently this has been going on for years ... Only Agent Volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred. CLOSE ON - MARCO, catching his breath. 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
... Sad little Tin Soldier. 
124   INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY                  124 
Ellie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco's extensive file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological profiling, FBI updates. Repeated buzzwords like: "mentally unstable," "obsessed with Raymond Shaw," "delusional," "borderline functional," "acute stress disorder ..." 
ELLIE 
Isn't it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens? Another failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman of Rhode Island -- 
RAYMOND 
-- I don't care. 
ELLIE 
Well, imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when Major Marco showed up at the airport and you invited him -- my God, invited him -- to tag along. Knowing what they knew. 
RAYMOND 
I know him. I served under him.   He was a good man. 
ELLIE 
That's what the neighbors always say about serial killers. Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed. 
ELLIE 
(sighs) Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a less stressful posting. Somewhere tropical. 
125   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                  125 
Marco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room: The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and: 
AGENT GOLDRING 
Goodbye. (to Marco) Get out of here. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
He's free to go? 
AGENT GOLDRING 
Shaw won't press charges, and he's got juice with important friends. It's today's daily double. Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and leaves the room. 
COLONEL GARRET 
Someone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called and intervened on your behalf. A beat.   Marco, trying to process all this: 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major, you have reached the terminal end of the Army's patience. You're relieved of duty, effective immediately. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
There's a young neurologist at Walter Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable success with GWS -- I want you to get your affairs in order and report to him 
(MORE) 
LT. COL. HOWARD (CONT'D) 
for evaluation and treatment first thing Monday morning.

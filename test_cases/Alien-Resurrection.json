A few of them look down. \nANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT \nThe aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading up at high speed. \nJOHNER \nThey can work the elevators?  Is there anything fucking else we should know about them?! \nHe's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of them. \nThe lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is flipped. \nThey wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead. \nCALL \nGet on! \nA moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift. \nCall drops back down inside. \nAn alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.

Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors \nThe alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs Call's ankle, but \nRipley wrenches her free. \nThey roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside the lift. \nRipley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the lift.  FIRES. \nThe lift PLUMMIETS, the alien still halfway in. \nIt shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as-- \nThe lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens to jelly. \nANGLE:\tUPPER DOOR \nJohner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft. \nJOHNER \nEat that, fuckneck!! \nThey all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next stretch. \nCall stands with her back to them. \nVRIESS \nBaby, am I glad to see you.  I thought dickbag took you out for sure. Are you, hurt? \nCALL \nI'm fine. \nDISTEPHANO \nYou got body armour on? \nCALL \nYeah.  Come on. \nRipley isn't buying. \nRIPLEY \nYou were Gunshot.

Is that it? \nCALL \nLeave me alone. \nHer voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by the wounds. \nThe voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely. \nVRIESS \nCall .... \nCALL (bitterly) \nYes. \nST JUST \nLM7?  Shit.  That explains a lot. \nYRIESS (to Ripley) \nThe latest and best.  They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industy. \nInstead they buried it. \nRipley looks at the girl. \nRIPLEY \nThey were-too good. \nVRIESS \nOh yeah.  Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors.  Didn't feel like being told what to do. \nThe government ordered a recall.  Fucking massacre. \nHILLARD \n1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man... I never thought I'd see one. \nJohner starts laughing. \nJOHNER \nOh, Christ.  Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second hand junk to the farm belt... and we're carrying the most expensive piece of contraband in the system. \nThat's rich. \nPURVIS (getting anxious) \nIt's great, she's a toaster oven... Can we leave now? \nVriess tries to touch Call's wound. \nVRIESS \nLet me see. \nCall pulls away. \nJOHNER \nYeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess. \nMaybe she just needs an oil change. \nRIPLEY \nLet's go. \nThey start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear \nJOHNER \nCan't believe I almost fucked the thing. \nST JUST \nYeah, like you've never fucked a robot. \nANGLE: RIPLEY \nLetting DiStephano lead. \nRIPLEY \nDiStephano.

Storage... the chapell's up here, not much else. \nRIPLEY \nCan we get to the ship? \nDISTEPHANO \nWell, we're a ways out,of the way, but I think we can get through to the garden. \nFrom there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able. \nWhat if the fucking doctor gets there first? \nVRIESS \nIt's a good point. \nDISTEPHANO \nShit. \nThey have reached an access door.  Debris blocks the way. \nRIPLEY \nAnother way? \nDISTEPHANO \nUh, yeah.  Through the wall.  We'll have to get one of these panels off.

Terrified, but determined, she reaches for a lever \nRIPLEY \nNo! Over here! \nCalling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms. \nCALL \nRipley!  Let it come!  Let it come! \nTears run through her voice as she strains for the lever.

There is a hollow click. \nFurious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.  A SSCREAM wells up in her throat and she \nTHROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester. \nCall pulls the lever. \nIn an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes. \nAnd it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically. \nRipley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- but the beast grabs her, holds her.  The blades ever closer as she struggles with it. \nANGLE: CALL \nStill trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the machine all around her! \nShe squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.  A stream of blood lands on her shoulder, eating it away.  Another on her leg, and panic blooms, bright in her. \nCALL \nRIPLEY! \nGalvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and spark, blood eating through the controls. \nCall writhes, blood everywhere now.  She is lost in primal terror. \nRipley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood splattering her, wrenchs Call free.  She drags her' out. \nA section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the dying alien. \nCall lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around her. \nCovered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it still. \nDISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL \nBurning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.

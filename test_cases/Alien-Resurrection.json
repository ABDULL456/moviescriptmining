{"train": "Alien Resurrection \nEXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK. \nWe sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes into view: \nthe U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically just beyond Pluto's orbit. \nWe TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and \nINT.  AURIGA \nalong the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold. \nINT.  MEDLAB \nAlong a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. \nAs we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human. \nStill TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass encased in a clear, aspic-like gel. \nTubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine. \nAs we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can see what might even be a face. \nEyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming. \nANGLE: WHEAT. \nA birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen. Sharp contrast to what we have seen before. \nThere is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven or eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair. \nGIRL'S VOICE \nMy mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there are. \nThe girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see. \nShe looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty yards away. \nThe girl's expression becomes perplexed. \nShe slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, wriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout. \nThe sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another. She looks down in  growing horror and sees: \nBlood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, a sea of blood now, dark, thick. \nThe girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  LAB \nInstruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure. \nScientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic. \nWe can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the size of a man, and in a new case. \nThe camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a second one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLLWAY \nTiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us... \nANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream it keeps shifting. \nShe opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless. \nShe reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard. \nTearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  OPERATING CHAMBER \nAnd the cause of this dream becomes apparant: \nANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST \nbeing cut open with a lasersaw. \nWe see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it. And her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her face her identity is unmistakable. \nAround her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a young and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands a bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN. \nWREN \nCareful ... ready with the amnio... \nGediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it. Pulls apart the chest. \nGEDIMAN \nThere she is... \nHe says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest. \nGEDIMAN \nHere we go. \nHe holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator filled with  amniotic fluid. \nThe alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of his grasp. \nWREN \nWatch it! \nEverybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the top rapidly. \nEverybody looks at each other for a moment. \nGEDIMAN \nWell ... \nWREN \nThe host? \nA surgeon looks at Ripley's readings. \nSURGEON \nDoing fine. \nGediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods. \nWREN \nSew her back up. \nGediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the alien. \nGEDIMAN \nWREN \nThere are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance. \nGEDIMAN \nShe's freaked. \nWren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance. \nWREN \n\"It\" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional autism. \nCertain reactions.... \nPerez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall. \nTO: \nINT HALL - CONTINUOUS \nThe two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second observation room. \nGEDIMAN: \nBut the thing is, we can't terminate her. It. \nPEREZ \nYou haven't told me what you think has caused this. \nCloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought to adult term.  I'm right? \nGEDIMAN \nThere's been cases.. \nPEREZ \nNot like this. \nWREN \nWell, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a collective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like instinct, only  more complex structurally. \nPEREZ \nIn some cases. You're talking about the alien. \nWREN \nYes. \nPEREZ \nYou promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing. \nWREN \nIt's not like the other ones.. \nPerez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second observation room door opens.. \nHe steps in, the other two right behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO \nDarker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards by the door. \nApart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others. \nPEREZ \nBut there is some genetic mix. \nWREN \nYes. \nPEREZ \nWill there be further mutation? \nGEDIMAN \nMutation isn't exactly... I don't think so. \nWREN \nThat's one of the things we need to study. \nPEREZ \nAll right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for God's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises. \nAnd as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at the back of his head. \nThe reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, stops it. \nAs it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the alien's face. \nIts bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off. \nPerez turns to look at it with the others. \nPEREZ \nIt took a hell of a lot to get us here. \nGEDIMAN \nNo shit. \nWren shoots him another look. \nPEREZ \nHow soon before this one's ovulating? \nWREN \nDays. \nPEREZ \nIs that normal? \nWREN \nNo way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated. \n(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies. \nPEREZ \nThey're coming.  Soon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MESS HALL \nI guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman. \n(to Hillard) \nBring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel. \nHILLARD \nDarlin', it's done. \nELGYN \nDon't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright. \nHe puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he exits. \nThey're more than friends. \nHe moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle. \nELGYN \nChristie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking. \nHe proceeds into: \nINT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS \nIt's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most of the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly the size of winnebagos. \nAs Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of them. \nShe's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth and prettiness. \nELGYN \nCall!  CALL! \nThe music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner. \nElgyn switches it off. \nELGYN \nCall! \nCALL \nWhat? \nELGYN \nWe're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured? \nCALL \nI checked 'em an hour ago. \nELGYN \nI don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your hide. \nCALL \nTrust me, boss. \nELGYN (laughs) \nNot my style. \nHe leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel dolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs. \nELGYN \nHow's it looking? \nVRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a total fucking write-off. \nELGYN \nYou'll make it good. \nVRIESS \nDon't be so sure. \n(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs! \nELGYN (straightening up) \nThey just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far. \nHe exits. \nCUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS \nCHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has distinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me authority. \nCHRISTIE \nWhat's our status? \nELGYN \nWe're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality. \nST JUST \nOh great.  Army food.. \nST JUST (\"San-Jhoost\") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool. \nMoves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is strapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer holder, but a very complex one. \nELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get those harvesters on their feet. \nThis'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are friendly. \nCHRISTIE \nWe expecting any trouble? \nELGYN \nFrom Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant. \nCUT TO: INT.  CARGO BAY     CONTNIUOUS \nANGLE: VRIESS working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the thresher inches above his head. \nVRIESS \nI'm patched in. Check the sequence timer. \n(no answer) \nCall? \nANGLE: THE CONTROLS \nA hand reaches in toward the ON switch. \nANGLE: VRIESS \nJOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for. \nVRIESS (to Call) \nWhat's the matter? \nShe is looking around her, somewhat tensely. \nCALL \nI don't like army. \nHILLARD \nYeah, join the fucking club. \nCUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY \nA stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, and identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail napkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills. \nWIDER ANGLE: INT.  PEREZIS CHAMBERS    LATER \nA good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn. \nPEREZ \nThis wasn't easy to come by. \nELGYN \nNeither was our cargo. You're not pleading poverty, are you? \nPEREZ \nWe're well funded. I mean the bills. There's not many that still deal in coin. \nELGYN \nJust the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded. The fringe element. \nI guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it? \nPEREZ \nDrink? \nELGYN \nConstantly.  I'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly approved by congress. \nPerez pours two whiskeys. \nPEREZ (changing the subject) \nSo where do you go from here? \nELGYN \nOut by the Handle.  We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working. \nPEREZ \nCall.  Where'd you find her? \nELGYN \nShe is severely fuckable, isn't she? - And the very devil with a socket wrench. \nI think Vriess somewhat pines. \nHe takes a stack of bill, smells it.  He likes the smell.- \nELGYN \nShe is curious about this little transaction.  You can hardly blame her, Awfully cloak and  dagger... \nPerez hands a drink to ELGYN. \nPEREZ \nThis is an army operation. \nELGYN \nMost army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space. \nAnd they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought. \nPEREZ \nDo you want something, Elgyn? \nELGYN \nJust bed and board, couple of days worth.  If we're not imposing. \nPEREZ \nNot at all. Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, and mi casa is yours too. \nElgyn drinks to that. \nPEREZ \nI trust, of course, that you can mind your own business. \nELGYN (smiles) \nI'm famous for it. \nThey drink. \nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA \nThe 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is wheeled into: \nINT.  A CHAMBER \nWhere Wren and a few others are waiting.  Gediman looks a little nervous, not sure this is a good idea. \nThe cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the electric lock. \nIt springs open and the guard slides off a side panel. \nThey are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes. People sleeping inside. \nOne by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second unit is wheeled in. \nBy the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in the dark chamber. \nThe scientists meanwhile retire to INT.  AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a long glass window looking at the chamber. \nThe last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock behind them. \nWren starts pushing buttons. \nThe glass tops of the cryotubes slide open.  We see temperature and lifesign gauges begin to change.. \nThere is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly. \nStuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs.  The ceiling rotates just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers. \nFor a moment nothing happens. \nVRIESS, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over. \nChristie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall. \nCUT TO:  INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT \nA sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near emptiness of the room. \nGediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he watches the pen. \nInside are three aliens. Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and hissing at it. \nGediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the beast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue issues slowly forth, dripping with slime. \nGEDIMAN (softly, fascinated) \nIs that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see me? \nThe creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes. \nSomething moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand closes on his shoulder. \nIt's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems only mildly surprised. \nGEDIMAN \nHow did you get in here? \nRIPLEY \nBeautiful, aren't they? \nGEDIMAN \nYes.  Yes they are.  I've been monitoring their interaction. \nHe points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the vibrating line, indicating sound. \nHe notices that her hand is still on her shoulder. \nGEDIMAN \nThey communicate.  Through ultrasonic soundwaves.  Sort of like bats. \nRIPLEY \nI know. \nShe looks at him. \nRIPLEY \nI can hear them. \nGEDIMAN (smiling) \nAmazing ... \nShe runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up off his chair. \nGEDIMAN \nRipley... \nRIPLEY \nShhhhh. \nShe pulls him close, kisses him.  Lightly at first, then deeply - holding his head with both hands. He responds with surprising warmth, the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart. \nShe looks at him, smiles. \nAn alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth, burying itself in his face. \nSMASH CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CHAMBER \nAs she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard. \nShe has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: squatting in the middle of the room. She looks about her, recovering from the nightmare... Her breathing slows. With a somewhat fatalistic look, she settles back to sleep. \nCUT TO: INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT \nChristie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table. \nThey are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high. \nJOHNER \nI'm in. \nCHRISTIE \nAll right. \nST JUST \nRaise you two hundred. \nJOHNER \nOh, fuck you! \nCALL \nThat's it. I'm out. I'm fucked. \nShe throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine. It tastes horrible. \nCHRISTIE \nThat takes me down, too. Johner? \nJOHNER \nUh, Uh, fuck it. I fold. \n(to St Just) \nWhat do-you got? \nSt Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck. \nST JUST \nYou'll always wonder. \nJOHNER \nYou asshole. \nCHRISTIE \nJohner, your deal. \nCALL \nDeal me out. It's not my night. \nShe tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair.  The others laugh. \nCALL \nJesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid? \nRIPLEY \nIt's in my head.  Behind my eyes.  I can hear it moving.  The beast. \nThe smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through.  Call softens, trying a different tack. \nCALL \nHelp me.  If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them before  this thing gets loose. \nRIPLEY \nIt's already loose. \nCall's expression changes.  Those words terrify her, but she's not sure if Ripley means what she thinks. \nRipley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops a few inches away. \nThen touches her forehead gently, almost sensually. \nRIPLEY \nOnce the thought .... the hope for it ... grows here.... it has found its way. \nIt will come, because... man will bring it.  Bring it forth. \nCALL \nYou want that. \nRIPLEY \nI've come to terms with the fact of it. It's inevitable. \nCALL \nNot so long as there's breath-in me. \nRipley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALL'S THROAT.  Call swings wit the blade but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect.  Ripley squeezes the girls neck. \nRipley looks at the girl with a world of sadness. \nRIPLEY \nI can... make it ... stop... \nCall's eyes are pleading, terrified. Ripley finally lets go and she drops to the ground gasping for air.  RIPLEY \nGo. They're coming for you. \nAs soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out. \nCUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS \nCall comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head. She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them and three more. \nWREN \nI think you're gonna find that this was ill advised. \n(to the men) Where are her friends? \nGUARD \nMess hall, most of them. \nWREN \nSound the alarm. I want them rounded up. Now! \nTO: INT.  MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER \nANGLE: THE CARD TABLE \nBeing kicked over. \nElgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused. \nChristie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers. \nCall is thrown into the group as well. \nELGYN \nWhat the fuck is going on here? \nCHRISTIE \nLooks like a doublecross, boss. \nWREN \nWhere's the other one? With the chair? \nJOHNER (to a soldier) \nGet your fucking hands off me! \nELGYN \nDo you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to? \nWREN \nShut up! \n(to a guard) Get the general.  Wake him up. \nELGYN \nLook, if there's a problem tell me what it is. We can work this out, there is no  need to get emotional ... \nSt Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley attacked Johner. \nHands behind his back. \nANGLE: BEHIND ST JUST'S BACK \nAs Elgyn speaks, two guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands. \nCALL \nThey got nothing to do with this, Wren. \nELGYN (to Call) \nTo do with what? \nWREN  I don't give a fuck. It's way too late for that. You're all looking at a firing squad. \nYou hear me? \nELGYN \nI do.  St Just? \nWith lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the guards away. \nHe takes out a third to his left without even looking that way. \nOne guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat. \nChristie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun inside. He grabs it and another  guard runs. Johner doesn't have time to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it, sending the guard flying.. \nHe punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded lieutenant. \nPEREZ \nStatus! \nLIEUTENANT \nContainment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks. \nPEREZ (to himself) \nA military strike.... Christ Jesus ... \nAfter a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes. \nCUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS \nIt's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into it, falling in a tumble of guns. \nOver the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is excruciatingly calm: \nFATHER \nEmergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This is not a drill. \nOne soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong with two of his friends. \nThey're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It bounds forward, takes out his face. \nFATHER \nEmergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ... \nCUT TO.. \nINT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning voice and the emergency lighting are on. \nVriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, checking out his surroundings. \nANGLE: DOWN THE HALL \nThere is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit. \nVriess follows their lead, wheeling out. \nCUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS \nNothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, carefully. \nAnd was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling. \nA drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down -- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops to the floor, eating casually through. \nCUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS \nMen are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after. \nPEREZ \nBay three!  Go! \nThe late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He hits the eject button and steps back. \nCUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS \nAs the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft. \nCUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS \nMen crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are screaming. \nPerez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button. \nTO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS \nThe second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES. \nCUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS \nThe noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all around the group. \nFather's voice still urges evacuaticion \nWREN \nNO! \n(to Call) \nWhat have you done? \nCALL \nNothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it. \nELGYN \nAll right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk? \nHe is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing. \nHILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in between? \nCALL (indicating Wren) \nHe does. \nOne of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano. \nDISTEPHANO (to Wren) \nSir, we have to go. \n(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel. \nELGYN \nYou can have him when we're off. Not before. \nThey start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the soldiers. \nWhat about Vriess? \nJOHNER \nFuck Vriess! \nCUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS \nVries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged. \nThe lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys. \nSomething stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes. \nVriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see. \nIt starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST. \nVriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly compared to the beast. \nThe group looks it over. Parts of the ship are simply not there, the sections around those holes red.  Wren points them out. \nWREN \nWe've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- Jesus, right by the engine room.  We're very lucky. \nST JUST (sarcastically) \nLucky we. \nCHRISTIE \nWhat about the Betty?  Our ship. \nWREN \nThe dock seems to be intact. \nCHRISTIE \nThen we head for it. \nJOHNER \nCan we track those fucking things? \nWREN \nNo. \nJOHNER \nWe could get to the Betty and they could be all over it! \nRANE \nAre you toting a better fucking idea? \nWREN \nAll of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the barracks. \nThere's no reason to suppose they'd move \nRIPLEY \nThey won't. \nEverybody looks at her. \nRIPLEY \nThey're breeding. They've got new bodies to work on. They'll stay close. If they send anybody out, it'll be here. Where the... meat is. \nCALL \n'The meat' . Jesus. \nST JUST \nThey're breeding.  How long does that take? \nRIPLEY \nHours. \nWREN \nOr less.  The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned cells. \nCHRISTIE \nFaster we get from here to there, the better. \nST JUST \nWith all the devils of hell in between. \nJOHNER \nWell, if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple. \n(to Vriess) \nNo offense. \nVRIESS (giving him the finger) \nNone taken. \nHILLARD \nNobody's left behind, Johner. Not even you. \nHer voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her. \nCHRISTIE \nSo what's our route? \nWREN \nI'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked on both sides here, \nI'm not sure \nDISTEPHMO \nSir?  There is the lift. \nWREN \nShow me. \nDiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's indicating revealed. \nDISTEPHMO \nThe lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to engineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a maintenece access tunnel here \n(points to the center of the shaft) \nthat runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock. \nCHRISTIE \nSounds reasonable. \nDISTEPHANO \nI don't have the code for the access tunnel door. \nWREN \nI can override. \nDISTEPHMO \n(indicating the route) \nThen we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom of the shaft. \nUp, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free. \nCHRISTIE \nI understand my hide.  And I like it on me. Let's go. \n(to Ripley) \nWhat are you called, Ripley?  You mind taking point? \nShe moves to the head of the line, and they start. \nCUT TO: INT.  LABS - LATER \nAs they progress.  Everyone with a gun has it at the ready.  Ripley is a few yards in front. \nShe stops, sniffs.  Listens. \nRIPLEY \nClear. \nJohner moves up next to her. \nJOHNER \nYou've come up against these things before? \nRIPLEY \nYes. \nJOHNER \nSo what did you do ? \nRIPLEY \nI died. \nHe lags behind a bit, thrown. \nJOHNER \nThat wasn't really what I wanted to hear... \nDiStephano points to a door. \nDISTEPFANO \nThis way. \nAnd Ripley leads them in. \nCUT TO: INT.  LAB - CONTINUOUS \nAs Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed.  Ripley surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one. \nAmong the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward. \nJOHNER \nFuck me ... \nCHRISTIE \nLet's keep moving. \nThe door to the next chamber is ajar. Christie and Vriess in, then St Just, then Ripley. \nINT..NEXT CHAMBER \nSomething LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS into her side, throwing her off balance. \nSt Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure cowering in the corner. \nEveryone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with terror. \nPURVIS \nGet away from me! \nCHRISTIE \nDrop the rod, man.  Do it! \nPURVIS. \nGet away... \nBut the energy is out of him.  The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He looks weakly from face to face. \nPURVIS \nWhat's going on? \nSt Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls. \nST JUST \nPurvis.  What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship. \nPURVIS \nWhat ship?  Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew for the nickel refinery... \nI wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ... \nCALL \nLook, you come with us.  It's dangerous here. \nRipley SNIFFS.  Cocks her head. \nRIPLEY \nLeave him. \nCALL \nFuck you.  We're not leaving anyone on this boat. \nRIPLEY \nHe's carrying.. \nJOHNER \nHe's what? \nRIPLEY \nHe's got one....\tinside him. I can smell it. \nPURVIS \nInside me? What? \nJOHNER \nShit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass. \nVRIESS \nIt's a bad risk. \nCHRISTIE \nYou want to get yourself killed, then you run solo. \nST JUST \nHow many? \nRIPLEY \nAt least two. \nST JUST \nThink they heard us? \nRIPLEY \nYep. \nHILLARD \nFine by me ... \nJOHNER \nYeah, let 'em come. \nCHRISTIE \nWren.  Any other way around? \nWren shakes his head. \nCHRISTIE \nWe can't just walk in there. \nWREN (thinking) \nNo. No, but they can. \nCHRISTIE \nSay again? \nWREN \nThe cages all have failsafes.  Liquid nitrogen.  Get 'em to come to us and I can freeze em. \nCHRISTIE \nExcellent.   Get-ready. \nWren goes over to the failsafe button. The others look out at the aliens. \nCHRISTIE \nOkay... (calls out) Hey! \nVRIESS \nHey, guys! \nJOHNER \nHere, kitty... \nThe aliens react, start for the cage.  Four 'of them.  They reach the edge of it and stop. \nLook around, at each other.. \nBut go nowhere. \nDISTEPHMO \nThey're not coming. \nJOHNER \nHey!  Fresh meat here! \nRIPLEY. \nThey know it's a trap. \nRANE \nOh, bullshit! \nCHRISTIE \nWhat do we do? \nJOHNER \nShoot the fucking things! \nVRIESS \nThere's too many, and we don't have the angle. \nRIPLEY \nBait. \nCALL \nWhat? \nRIPLEY \nGive em a reason to go in there. Throw somebody in. \nHILLARD \nFuck you! \nRIPLEY \nDO we want to live? Give em her. \nShe indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest about this idea. \nRipley points at Rane. \nRIPLEY \nOr the skinny one, it doesn't matter. We can't resist the smell of meat. \nCALL \nWe ? \nJOHNER \nFuck, I'm with her!  Give 'em Annalee! \nCHRISTIE \nNow hold on \nDISTEPHMO \nEach one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all. \nRipley approaches, and stares at number seven. \nA complete mixture of alien and human DNA. \nA tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare. \nHooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head nearly level with \nRipley's as she finally approaches it. \nWhen it opens its eyes, they are hers. \nit tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her.  Recognises her. \nRipley cannot even speak.  She begins to shake slightly looking at number seven. \nNUMBER SEVEN \nKill ... us ... \nRipley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling a mouth. \nRipley staggers back a step, shaking now.  This is too much to bear... \nCALL \nRipley! \nRipley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream. \nCall cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK.  Her eyes meet Ripley's. \nCall tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it Ripley FIRES, a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in fire and noise, she FIRES another, tissue and steel exploding into flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily...And she FIRES, the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame. \nFreezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber. \nShe backs out, the crew waiting for her outside. \nThe launcher falls loudly to the ground.  Ripley turns to Wren, her face rigid with pain. \nWren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others have no thought of providing. \nCALL \nRipley... Don't do it. \nRipley stops. weariness suffusing her expression. \nRIPLEY \nDon't do what? \nThe tension pases.  Wren breathes a little sigh of relief. \nCall PUNCHES him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses to the ground. \nCall starts down the hall, not even looking at him. \nCALL \nDon't do that. \nFeeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this. It's kind of winning. \nChristie helps him up. \nCHRISTIE \nHad it coming, Doc. \nJohner looks in at the burning lab. \nJOHNER \nWhat's the big deal?  Fucking waste of ammo. \nST JUST \nLet's move before anything comes to check out the noise. \nJOHNER \nChicks, man.... \nDISTEPHANO \nWe go down from here. \nCHRISTIE (to Vriess) \nWe got to lose the chair.  Vriess. \nVRIESS \nI know. \nCHRISTIE \nKawlang maneuver, all right? \nVriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair. \nVRIESS \nJust like old times... \nCUT TO: INT.  ROOM - LATER \nA hatch opens. Ripley drops down, surveys the scene.  Quiet dark, empty. \nRipley comes up, Call behind her.  Ripley sniffs, listens.  Closes her eyes. After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to follow. \nSlowly, they make their way down the corridor. Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , guns drawn. \nBringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun.. He turn slowly, alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other way, also with a shotgun. \nCALL (to Ripley) \nThat lab... 1 can't imagine how that must feel. \nRIPLEY \nNo. You can't. \nRipley looks down.  The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark water. \nRipley steps into it, moves up a few paces. The others gingerly follow. \nVriess is facing the back. He looks up. \nVRIESS \nThe cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble. \nANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS \nWe see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.  There are gaping, twisted holes in them. \nJOHNER \nThe nasties couldn't have done it, could they? \nHILLARD \nAssface, We're on the top of this thing. \n(pointing to the ceiling) \nThat's hull. \nVRIESS \nWhat about Wren? if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us around. \nRIPLEY \nWe have to get in too. \nDISTEPHANO \nThere's no access console on this level. We'd have to-backtrack. \nHILLARD \nFuck that. \nDISTEPHANO \nAnd I don't have the security access that Wren does anyway. \nRipley turns to Call. \nRIPLEY \nCall. \nCALL \nNo. I can't. \nJOHNER. \nBullshit.  She's a damn well talking machine. \nCALL \nThere's another way. \nDISTEPHMO \nJust tell her to access it on remote. \nVRIESS \nShit, that's right.  Any of the new model droids can access the mainframe. \nJOHNER \nJust by blinking. \nCALL \nI can't. \nST JUST \nNo time to get coy, Annalee. \nCALL \nI can't. I burned my modem drive.  We all did. \nVRIESS \nYou can still patch in manually. You know that. \nCall looks over at the group, staring at her.  She knows she doesn't have a choice. \nDISTEPHANO \nThere's ports in the chapel. \nRIPLEY \nCome on. \n(to the others) \nYou get started on that wall. \nCUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOU@ \nRipley and Call enter the small room.  Ripley sits in one of the pews, pulls out a bible. \nit somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen reading.: \nHOLY BIBLE.  PRE START. \nRipley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up \nCALL \nDon't make me do this. \nRIPLEY \nDon't make me make you. \nCALL \nI don't want to go in there. \nRIPLEY \nGet over it. \nCALL \nIt's like... your insides are liquid. It's not real. \nRIPLEY \nYou can blow the ship.  Before it reaches Earth.  Kill them all.  Just give us time to get \nout first. \nThat convinces Call.  She pulls up her sleeve, and begins. pushes a part of her forearm, \njust below the crook of her elbow.  It has a spring release catch, and a small panel rises \nup with two computer ports on it.  She takes the cable from Ripley and plugs it in. \nIt looks almost like she's mainlining heroin. \nShe cocks her head. \nCALL \nDammit. \nRIPLEY \nAnything? \nCALL \nYes.  But I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.  And I'm not sure they are. \nCALL \nWhy do you go on living?  How can you stand it?  How can you stand... yourself? \nRipley shrugs. \nRIPLEY \nNot so hard.  Not much choice. \nCALL \nAt least there's part of you that's human.  I'm just... fuck.  Look at me.... \nShe looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers. \nCALL \nI'm disgusting. \nHer voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie.  It's a mechanical problem, but \nit sounds just like despair. \nRIPLEY \nDo you dream? \nCALL \nI ... we have neural processors that run through....  (stops)  Yes. \nRIPLEY \nWhen I sleep, I dream about it.  Them.  Every night.  All around me ... in me. \nI used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore. \nCALL \nWhy? \nRIPLEY \nBecause no matter how bad the dreams get ... when I wake up it's always worse. \nPurvis enters. \nPURVIS \nI guess we're almost there. \nRIPLEY \nRight. \nHe exits again.  Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring.  We hear her voice slip back to normal as she says: \nCALL \nLet's get going. \nCUT TO: INT. TUNNEL \nAs they come one by one through the wall. \nDISTEPHANO \nNot far now. \nPURVIS \nGod, I'm so tired... \nJOHNER \nYeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead. \nRipley follows him through. \nRIPLEY \nDon't count on it. \nThe rest of them come through and walk into: \nINT.  THE GARDEN    CONTINUOUS \nThe Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a terraced slope. \nEverywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, exotic and experimental hybrids. \nAccess paths crisscross the beds. \nIt's huge, the single biggest space on the ship.  Yet the low ceiling, laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic. \nFrom where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down. \nJOHNER \nWhat's this fucking deal? \nDISTEPHMO \nThis supplies most of the food for the unit. \nVRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear) \nYou guys got something against spam? \nDISTEPHMO \nAnd there's some lab work here too. Hybridization. \nRIPLEY \nAt the other end? \nDISTEPHMO \nRuns down to the by the waste tanks.  We can get to the dock from there.  You, okay? \nRipley is holding her head.  She shuts her eyes. \nCALL \nWhat is it? \nRipley shakes it off. \nRIPLEY \nNothing.  I'm okay. \nShe looks out at the jungle, they have to cross. \nCALL \nWe should get moving. \nST JUST \nSt Just! \nST JUST \nYou go. \nHe looks at the appraching aliens. \nST JUST \nI'm bored. \nCALL\\SHIP \nWarning.  Evacuate sector. \nA moment, then the crew takes off. \nSt Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth.  Only the slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens. \nThey close on him, and he raises his guns. \nCALL\\SHIP \nwarning... \nCUT TO: \nINT HALL NEARBY - CONTINUOUS \nThe crew runs full out. \nDISTEPHANO \nWe have to get out of the sector! \nRIPLEY \nWhere! \nDISTEPHANO \nThere! \nHe points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall. \nCUT TO: INT. HALL CONTINUOUS \nThe aliens close, and St Just FIRES, blasting away with bot guns. Aliens writhe on the \nfloor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still he fires, \nCall\\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos \n-- St Just fires until both guns are empty.  In one smooth motion he drops them both \nand jerks his wrists and TWO-MORE disposable guns fly into his palms and he blasts away \nANGLE: THE BLOOD \nEating through the hull. \nANGLE: THE CREW \ndesperately racing for the door. \nANGLE: ST JUST \nFiring with quiet glee. \nANGLE: THE CREW \nThe first of them are through the door. \nANGLE: St JUST \nThe aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his guns click, spent. \nST JUST \nDamn. \nCALL\\SHIP \nWarning -- \nand BOOM!!!!, the hall BURSTS OPEN, everything explodes into space, the wind rushes out as \nBOOM!!!, the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as \nANGLE: RIPLEY \nis the last to get out, but the pressure change SUCKS HER she flies backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she SLAMS into it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds. \nThe others have exited into the next hall.  They've been tossed about, but not as badly. \nCall stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up.  Ripley is dazed; the door hit the back of her head solidly. \nCALL \nCan you walk?  RIPLEY \nI think I... \nCALL \nI'm not fucking carrying you \nRipley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out. Ripley puts her hands over her ears. \nRIPLEY \nMistake ... mistake... \nCALL \nRipley. \nRIPLEY \nI can hear them, in the hive... it's close...\tWe're on the hive. \nCALL \nJesus.  Come on. \nRIPLEY \nI can hear them... the queen... \nCALL \nWhat... ? \nRIPLEY \nShe's in pain. \nThey CRASH UP through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the two women. \nCall can barely spin before Ripley GRABS her and HURLS her fifteen feet down the corridor, out of harm's way. \nThe aliens close on Ripley. She struggles but she's still weak.  One slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley \nand head for the cockpit.  DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair. \nCALL \nJohner, take Purvis to the freezer. \nJOHNER \nAll right.. Nap time, buddy. \nA GUNSHOT and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, Johner draws but \nWren emerges from the shadows too fast. \nWren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right below her shoulderblades. \nWREN \nFuck with me and I put a bullet where her brain is! \nJohner stands, uncertain. \nWREN \nDiStephano!  Take their weapons. \nDISTEPHANO \nBegging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck. \nDiStephano aims at Wren.  Wren backs up a step. \nWREN \nDrop it!  Drop it or we all die together! \nHeaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward.  His eyes go wide. \nCUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5   CONTINUOUS \nRipley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds.  It's just beginning to work. \nBut the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated as the Queens belly begins moving more violently.  SHRIEKS, and RIPLEY does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as \nTHE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN.  Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the walls. \nAnd all the screaming stops.  The movement stops.  Even Ripley stops. Silence. \nSomething emerges from the wound. \nAn alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous haunches, thick and powerful. \nIts head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to the back. \nIt has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its tongue does. \nIts much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself. \nAnd it's bone white. \nGEDIMAN \nBeautiful.... beautiful butterfly... \nHe is crying with revelatory joy.  Ripley is not.  Grimacing the sight and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds. \nOne of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes up. \nDangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a burner. \nSOLDIER \nNo, God... \nHe SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror.  The newborn stops, tilting its head: \nIt LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a monstrous flea. \nLeaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with its four forelegs as he screams lustily. \npincers SWING out and pin either side of his head.. His eyes go wide as: \nIts tongue SHOOTS into his throat.  Stays there, and we watch it drain the blood from his body.  We can see it, see its stomach swell, red tinged, as his body goes \nblue and slack. His rifle drops into the black pool. \nGediman stares, transfixed, and it LANDS ON HIM. \nCUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS \nJohner's gun drops to the floor. \nEveryone backs off. \nWREN \nThe fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it according to standard operational procedure. \nCALL \nNo she's not. \nDISTEPHMO \nYou're fucking nuts.  You still want to bring those things back to earth? \nJOHNER \nHave you been paying any attention today? \nWREN \nI can handle the animals! \nCALL \nFucking shoot me. \nWREN \nShut up!!! \nAnd Purvis LAUNCHES from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face.  The soldier drops like a sack. \nThe other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis SLAMS his fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, rolling, grabbing his gun -- \nPurvis is a man possessed.  He grabs Wren's gunhand and SMAS it against an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun. \nPurvis jerks.  Blood blooms in his chest. \nEverybody stops, mesmerized. wren drops to his knees, going for the gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of Wren's head is against his chest. \nPurvis jerks again.  It takes Wren a moment to understand what's happening. \nThey both scream. \nThen alien BURSTS out of Purvis's chest, STRAIGHT INTO WRENS SKULL. \nEveryone else is still frozen.  Then the little critter bursts out of Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess.  CUT TO: INT.

Two less-than-human SCREAMS fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart. \nThe beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley again. \nRipley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head. \nShe dives at it as it comes out from under.... \nCall shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch, \nRipley only slightly better. \nA few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down the spiral staircase to that level. \nJOHNER \nWhere are you going? \nThe creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying strength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... its jaws open, dripping shaking... \nThe tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT. \nA scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she SCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE. \nShe stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near. They watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to Call.  Ripley looks a tad pissed. \nCall tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well. \nRipley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on. \nCall looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still twitching. \nCHRISTIE \nWhat the FUCK is going on here? \nRANE \nWhat was that thing?  Are there more of that thing? \nJOHNER (to Call) \nMake a hell of a necklace... \nANGLE: HILLARD \non the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body.  No tears, but terribly quiet. \nWhat do we do? \nCHRISTIE \nSame thing we were doing.  We get the fuck. \nRANE \nWhat if there's more?  Let's stay here and let the army guys deal. Someone will come... I mean, where are the fucking army guys? \nSt Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn \nCHRISTIE \nDoctor.  You know what that thing is? \nWREN \nI do. \nCHRISTIE \nAnd there's others.  How many? \nThe doctor looks around, almost guiltily. \nWREN \nThirty. \nJOHNER \nThirty!  We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those things. \nRIPLEY \nThere'll be more. \nEveryone looks around at her.  She is squatting in the corner facing away from them. \nRIPLEY \nThey'll breed.  In a few hours there'll be twice that number. \n", "test1_true": "So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat? \nCHRISTIE \nYou bought your ticket when you killed that thing. welcome aboard. \nCALL. \nAre you fucking crazy? She doesn't care if we.... \nCHRISTIE (fiercely) \nYou got no authority here, Call!- Now secure it! \nIt's the first time Christie has raised his voice, and it has the desired effect. \nAfter a silent moment, Call starts again softly. \nCALL \nChristie, she's not human.  Wren cloned her because she was carrying an alien in her. \nShe could turn -- \nJOHNER \nNobody cares about your opinion, you bitch, you fucking mole -- \nCALL \nShe'll turn on us!  Just like that! \nCHRISTIE \nI don't give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or not. If we've got a wish to live then we work together, and that includes bug-lady. \nCALL \nYou can't trust her. \nCHRISTIE \nI don't trust anyone.  CUT TO: INT.  CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER \nThe group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the cellblock where \nRipley had been.  DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, looking about them. \nThey are followed by Christie and Wren. \nWREN \nThere's a console in the guards, station.  We can punch up a diagnostic of the ship and plan a route.  To your ship. \nCHRISTIE \nThat likes me fine. \nHe signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously. \nANGLE: HILLARD \nGently lays her coat over Elgyn's face. Johner looks down a moment. \nJOHNER \nVia con Dios, man. \nHillard stands. Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, a distrustful look on her face. \nRipley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of fascinated detatchment. \nCall looks back at her.  Ripley smiles, coldly. \nANGLE: IN THE CELLBLOCK \nThe group makes their way slowly, quietly.  They approach a bank of elevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway.  They are about to go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival. \nThe group backs up, spreads out. Those who can find cover take it. guns drawn. \nThe elevator doors open.  It is too dark inside to see: \nSuddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a figure appears in the light. \nEveryone jolts, about to fire. before they realize it is \nVRIESS \nWho sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide. twitchier than they. \nJOHNER \nOh, fuck... \nCALL \nvriess! \nVRIESS (mock casual) \nHey, whatchyou guys doing?  Hey, Annalee. \nCHRISTIE \nThought you were toast for certain. \nVRIESS \nYou've seen that fucking thing? \nWREN (suspiciously) \nWhere were you? \nVRIESS \nI was down by -- what do you mean? I was in maintenance, checking out your oxidation systems. \nJOHNER \nDoc's got a bug up his ass 'cause Call's a mole and he thinks we're a conspiracy. \nVRIESS (looking at Call) \nShe's a what? \nJOHNER \nA mole.  A fucking spy. \nVriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone. \nCHRISTIE \nWe got'a mission here, people.  Let's keep moving. \nThey do. \nCUT TO: INT.  GUARDS, STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nANGLE: THE CONSOLE \nA hologram of the ship appears above the screen.  It looks a solid as the ship itself, except that parts of it occasional break themselves down to show interiors. \n", "test1_id": 2073, "test2_input": "Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, pull him into it. \nHillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot. \nCall is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating the surface. \nShe is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB. \nA net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the surface. \nCall struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear through it, but they are getting weaker. \nRipley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close behind. \nShe looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface -- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running out of air KICKS at it, it  lets go. \nThe others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but it's tough, she  still can't get her head up -- \n--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful of water and begins thrashing. \nRipley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart with a mighty heave, she glides up through -- \nCLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE \nJust BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER CLAMPS DOWN ON HER. \nRipley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the surface. \nWren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in four shots. \nChristie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, in a circular sweep. \nThey decimate a number of eggs \nANGLE: UNDERWATER \nRipley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint. Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing horribly. \nIn utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are COMING RIGHT AT HER. \nABOVE - THE SURFACE \nMost of the crew has gotten up out of the water.  Christie holding a facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it. \nCHRISTIE \nGet it!  Kill it! \nCALL \nThe blood'll burn you!  Throw it! \nHe does, and Johner nails it in midflight. \nHillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not breathing. \nANGLE: UNDER THE SURFACE \nRipley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and shoots it. \nThey swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool. \nANGLE: ABOVE THE SURFACE \nThey come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them. Everyone who can, shoots it.  It falls back into the water. \nCHRISTIE \nA trap!  They set a goddamn ambush! \nJOHNER \nGive me that! \nHe pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him mouth to mouth. \nJohner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail bubble from below the surface. \nJOHNER (grinning feverishly) \nOkay!  Everybody out of the pool! \nVRIESS \nLet's get the fuck! \nDi Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand, \nHILLARD (to Wren) \nWhich way? \nWREN \nUp here. \nHe takes off, the others following. \nWREN \nUp through the lift shaft! \nHe stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt. \nST JUST \nCompany! \nHe's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens. \nShe herds them into the shaft. \nCUT TO: INT.  LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS \nIt goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever.. Enough room for or three \nelevators, one of which is two stories below. \nWREN \nUP! \nHe starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each shaft section. \nCall comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders. \nThey climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin POUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might. \nJOHNER \nMove! \nWREN \nNot far! \nStill POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls it out. \nANGLE: LIFT \nWren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet from the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad beside it as Call climbs up behind him. \nThe aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft to grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans on ladders. \n", "test2_true": "CALL \nHurry! \nWREN \nIt's jammed!  Shit!  Gun! \nShe hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE CHEST. \nShe flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT, lands HARD on an elevator six stories below. \nEyes wide and empty. \nVRIESS \nNOO! \nHe fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped through the opening door.. \nRipley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up just in time to see  the door shut.  The lock lights turn red. \nShe SLAMS against the door, but to no avail. \nThe aliens are getting closer.  St Just, the closest to the bottom, suddenly lets go of  the ladder.  His knees hooked over a rung, he drops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands. \nHe blows several holes in the nearest alien. \nRipley is furious, maybe surprised just how so.  Suddenly an alien RISES OVER THE LEDGE, it's not three feet away from her and she SCREAMS, HURLS herself at it and they both go \nFLYING OFF into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall. \nRIPLEY GRABS a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but she holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find puchase. We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call. \nANGTE: CALLS FACE \nAs the facehugger CLAMPS onto it. Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits probing Call's nostrils.  Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to find a better host. \nAnother alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess. Vriess frantically tries to reload. \nVRIESS \nIt's on us! \nChristie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES, but the alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him. He SCREAMS, lets go of the ladder \nVriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien flying off  and down the shaft. \nHILLARD \nWe gotta go! \nThe last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers. \nRIPLEY \nWe're locked in. \nJOHNER \nFuck! \nPURVIS \nHow far to the next door? \nDISTEPHANO \nAll the way. \nRIPLEY \nThen we climb. \nThey start, moving as fast as they can. \nVRIESSS (to Christie) \nYou just hang on, man.  I'll get us there. \nHe starts climbing up, impressively fast considering the burden hanging from his back. \nJOHNER (to Ripley) \nAre they going for reinforcements? \nRIPLEY \nFucked if I know. \nThey climb. \nAnd climb, the minutes stretching out, still no door.  Ripley easily ahead of the rest. \nFinally: \nRIPLEY \nI think I see the door. \nPURVIS (exhausted) \nGreat. \nVriess is having increasing trouble.  Hillard notices him lagging behind, and why. \nHILLARD \nVriess!  Jesus! \nVriess is moving very quickly, considering. But the effort is becoming too much. \nVRIESS \nWe're coming... \nJohner scrambles down next to Vriess. \nhe checks the pulse in Christie's neck. \nVriess, man... he's dead. \nRefusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further. \nVRIESS \nWe'll get him to medlab... just a little while ... \nJohner looks over at Hillard.  Without saying a word, she pull out a good-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open. \nShe slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body falls free. \nVriess shuts his eyes, feeling it.  ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT \nThere is silence as Christie's body drops down the black abyss \nUntil, from up the shaft next to where he fell, we see two ALIENS COMING UP. \nPURVIS \nFuck!  Company! \nHillard looks up the shaft. \n", "test2_id": 2074, "test3_input": "HILLARD \nHow much further?, \nJOHNER \nToo fucking far.  Let's G0 ! \nThey start to climb, but the aliens are making much better time. \nA loud CLACKING sounds from the bottom of the shaft.  A few of them look down. \nANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT \nThe aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading up at high speed. \nJOHNER \nThey can work the elevators?  Is there anything fucking else we should know about them?! \nHe's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of them. \nThe lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is flipped. \nThey wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead. \nCALL \nGet on! \nA moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift. \nCall drops back down inside. \nAn alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.  St Just shoots the shit out of it. \nHILLARD \nWhere are the others? \nCUT TO: INT.  LIFT - CONTINUOUS \nCall flips the brake off, and the lift shoots up.  She is holding her jacket closed around  her chest wound, but it doesn't seem to bother her particularly much. \nANGLE: ON TOP \nEverybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft. \nANGLE: INSIDE \nCall waits for the signal to stop and an alien PUNCHES THROUGH the bottom of the lift.  Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through, clawing for her. \nANGLE:\tON THE BOTTOM \nWe see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift. \nANGLE:\tON TOP \nRipley sees the door approaching \nRIPLEY \nstop! \nANGLE: INSIDE \nCall hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of the door - \n- giving both Ripley and Call access.  Bu the alien is still grabbing for her -- \nRipley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall. Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors \nThe alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs Call's ankle, but \nRipley wrenches her free. \nThey roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside the lift. \nRipley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the lift.  FIRES. \nThe lift PLUMMIETS, the alien still halfway in. \nIt shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as-- \nThe lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens to jelly. \nANGLE:\tUPPER DOOR \nJohner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft. \nJOHNER \nEat that, fuckneck!! \nThey all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next stretch. \nCall stands with her back to them. \nVRIESS \nBaby, am I glad to see you.  I thought dickbag took you out for sure. Are you, hurt? \nCALL \nI'm fine. \nDISTEPHANO \nYou got body armour on? \nCALL \nYeah.  Come on. \nRipley isn't buying. \nRIPLEY \nYou were Gunshot.  I saw. \nCALL \nI'm fine! \nRipley spins her around.  Call stares at Ripley, sullenly a small trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril. Ripley looks down. \nANGLE: CALL'S CHEST \nWren has indeed made a messy hole here, but where blood and bone should be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring.  To state the obvious: \nA robot. \nJOHNER \nCall's a goddam sythetic! \nHILLARD \nSon of a bitch.  Little Annalee's just full of surprises. \nRIPLEY (quietly) \nI should have known. \n", "test3_true": "Couldn't smell this one out? \nRIPLEY \nNo, I mean... all that crap about being human - there's no one so zealous as a Born Again. \nVRIESS (to Call) \nYou're an LM7, aren't you?  Is that it? \nCALL \nLeave me alone. \nHer voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by the wounds. \nThe voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely. \nVRIESS \nCall .... \nCALL (bitterly) \nYes. \nST JUST \nLM7?  Shit.  That explains a lot. \nYRIESS (to Ripley) \nThe latest and best.  They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industy. \nInstead they buried it. \nRipley looks at the girl. \nRIPLEY \nThey were-too good. \nVRIESS \nOh yeah.  Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors.  Didn't feel like being told what to do. \nThe government ordered a recall.  Fucking massacre. \nHILLARD \n1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man... I never thought I'd see one. \nJohner starts laughing. \nJOHNER \nOh, Christ.  Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second hand junk to the farm belt... and we're carrying the most expensive piece of contraband in the system. \nThat's rich. \nPURVIS (getting anxious) \nIt's great, she's a toaster oven... Can we leave now? \nVriess tries to touch Call's wound. \nVRIESS \nLet me see. \nCall pulls away. \nJOHNER \nYeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess. \nMaybe she just needs an oil change. \nRIPLEY \nLet's go. \nThey start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear \nJOHNER \nCan't believe I almost fucked the thing. \nST JUST \nYeah, like you've never fucked a robot. \nANGLE: RIPLEY \nLetting DiStephano lead. \nRIPLEY \nDiStephano.  Where are we? \nDISTEPHANO \nUpper decks... Storage... the chapell's up here, not much else. \nRIPLEY \nCan we get to the ship? \nDISTEPHANO \nWell, we're a ways out,of the way, but I think we can get through to the garden. \nFrom there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able. \nWhat if the fucking doctor gets there first? \nVRIESS \nIt's a good point. \nDISTEPHANO \nShit. \nThey have reached an access door.  Debris blocks the way. \nRIPLEY \nAnother way? \nDISTEPHANO \nUh, yeah.  Through the wall.  We'll have to get one of these panels off.  It'll take a while. \n(to Vriess) You got tools? \nVRIESS \nYeah, but no torch. \nJOHNER \nFucking blow the door! \n", "test3_id": 2075}

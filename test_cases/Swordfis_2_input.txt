GABRIEL Hold the wheel. 
Gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun, compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60. 
STANLEY Shit, it's blocked. 
Gabriel looks behind them, another black Suburban has blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third comes toward them down the alley. 
GABRIEL Keep it straight.

The speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they SCREAM backwards. 
Gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP. He clips it and pulls back the bolt. He grabs the wheel from Stan. 
GABRIEL It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon. 
ANGLE ON LAMBO 
As the Diablo slams backwards into the Suburban at sixty mph. Bam. 
Gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open roof and UNLOADS FULL-AUTO into the Suburban. The armor- piercing SHELLS PENETRATE the Armalite GLASS, RIPPING the occupants to shreds. 
Gabriel turns, FIRING at the other Suburban. 
GABRIEL Drive, drive! 
Stanley slides under Gabriel as Gabriel steps into the passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged under the Suburban. 
GABRIEL Go, go! 
Gabriel continues to BLAST FULL-AUTO, tearing the Suburban to shrapnel. 
STANLEY I am! 
Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- on toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac. 
Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver. The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack. 
Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main street. 
(CONTINUED) 
92   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                92 
More Suburbans head at them. Stan SCREAMS left into another alley. Through the cross streets whipping by at 100 mph, we see Suburbans parallel to them. 
Stan cranks his wheel right. 
STANLEY Shit! 
GABRIEL (changing out a clip) Keep your cool, Stanley. 
The Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running at the Suburbans. 
After a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's over. 
Gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns over the body and looks at the face. 
GABRIEL Goddamit.   I knew it. 
Gabriel walks back to one of the burning Suburbans where Stanley stands. 
GABRIEL Get in the fucking car, Stanley. 
STANLEY I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. 
Gabriel pulls out his H&K, points it at Stanley. 
GABRIEL You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my hydra. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
93   OMITTED                                                          93

Stanley is working at his terminal. 
GINGER Stanley?   You alright? 
STANLEY What do you think? I just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street. I'm just fucking great. It doesn't matter if I get my daughter back if I'm dead. Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You? 
She walks over to him and kneels down, places her hand on his leg, looks up at him.

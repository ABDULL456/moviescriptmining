The townspeople, with Doc f.g., are gathered silently in the street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. Doc wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting with expectancy. 
WHAT THEY SEE 
Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream- liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately Doc falls in step with him. The townspeople, still silent, trail after them 
MOVING SHOT - MACREEDY AND DOC 
in f.g., the townspeople behind them. In b.g., as we pass, we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered town a few short hours ago. 
MACREEDY (walking, after a beat, to Doc) Tim knows where to find me if I'm needed. 
Doc nods. He blinks and frowns... 
MACREEDY What's on your mind, Doc? 
DOC Nothing. Only... about that medal. Can we have it? 
MACREEDY "We...?" Can who have it? 
DOC We. (indicating the townspeople, with a vague wave of his hand) Us. 
MACREEDY Why? 
DOC Well, we need it, I guess. It's something we can maybe build on. This town is wrecked, just as bad as if it was bombed out. Maybe it can come back... 
MACREEDY Some towns come back. Some don't. It depends on the people. 
A NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do Doc and the townsmen. 
WHAT THEY SEE 
In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with Doc at his side and the people behind him. The train pulls in. 
DOC (still pressing) That medal would help. 
Macreedy is silent. He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it to Doc. 
DOC Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for everything. 
Macreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after him. 
EXT. PLATFORM 
as Macreedy boards the train. 
EXT. STREET 
The cars in front of the jail U-turn and start off with the prisoners. The people move silently toward the train. 
EXT. TRAIN 
Macreedy is at the passageway. Slowly the train moves out. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY OF TRAIN 
Macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway. The town is seen behind them and the people standing there. In the distance, Tim's car recedes. 
CONDUCTOR (curiously) What's the excitement? What happened?

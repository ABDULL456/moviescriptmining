BILLY It was cold. 
The news bothers no one. 
GRADY Let's get after our relief pitching problem. 
BILLY We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander. 
Few, if any of them, have heard of Bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes. 
GRADY Submariner? 
BILLY That's the one. Technically an underhander. 
GRADY What's his velocity? 
BILLY Unimpressive. 
ARTIE About 85. 
GRADY Does he have a good breaking ball? 
BILLY Doesn't have one. 
GRADY Why do you like this guy? 
BILLY Well, he gets people out. 
ARTIE The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him. 
GRADY He's down there. He's down there real low, too. 
BILLY Let's move on. 
The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing. 
EVENTUALLY - 
GRADY Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi. 
BILLY Knock me down. 
GRADY We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. (puts more names up) Or the other option. Just a thought. We go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy that's a little difficult but talented. A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not like Milton. Milton himself. Which do you want to talk about first? 
BILLY None of them. Grady looks like a man who can't take much more. 
BILLY You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way. 
BARRY We got some trades here. 
BILLY We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate. 
GRADY The (what) - 
BILLY Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get - He points to Peter. 
PETER You want me to speak? 
BILLY When I point at you, yes. 
PETER Ten-ninety-two. 
BILLY Divided by three - 
PETER Three-sixty-four. 
BILLY That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is - 
PETER Three-sixty-four. 
ARTIE That doesn't come out right. 
BILLY You gotta carry the one. 
ARTIE Still don't look right. 
BILLY It's right. The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room. 
GRADY Billy? 
BILLY Yes. 
GRADY Who's that? 
BILLY That's Peter. And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter. 
GRADY I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here? 
BILLY Yes. 
POLONI What's with this on base percentage obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit? 
BILLY You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care. 
Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on strips, and approaches the board. 
BILLY So here's who we want. One. 
He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI. 
BILLY Jason's little brother Jeremy. 
BARRY He never comes home from the games. 
POLONI Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on the field -- not to mention his problems off the field -- not to mention he's getting a little thick around the middle -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's at strip joints... 
GRADY This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake. 
BILLY His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year. 
GEORGE He can't catch a ball in the outfield. I've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight. Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE. 
BILLY David Justice. 
GRADY Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight. 
PITTARO He's 36! 
ARTIE His legs are gone. He's a defensive liability. I question whether the bat speed is still there. 
BARRY Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him. 
BILLY That's good. 
HOPKINS He's a fossil. With all due respect, bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire. 
GRADY And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract? 
Billy points at PETER -- 
PETER He gets on base.

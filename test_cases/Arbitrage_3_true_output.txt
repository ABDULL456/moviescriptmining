INT. SYD'S LIMO - DAY 
Robert rides with Syd. He reviews a DOCUMENT entitled "MAPLE LANE TRUST - James L. Grant - Beneficiary." 
Robert signs the document, closing the folder. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 52. 
ROBERT You're gonna sign him out? 
SYD I called in Earl Monroe. 
ROBERT The basketball player? 
SYD Civil rights attorney. You remember Crown Heights? 
ROBERT He's the best? 
SYD He's the best above 96th Street- and that doesn't make him any cheaper. 
Robert slumps back, staring out the window. 
ROBERT You've gotta get Jimmy out of this. 
SYD It might not be that easy. If he doesn't cooperate they're likely to indict him on obstruction. 
ROBERT What would he be looking at? 
SYD Hard to say. With his prior... Five years, maybe ten. 
Robert's silent.

EARL I'll call you tomorrow if there's any news. Don't worry about anything. And don't talk to anyone else. You take care. 
Jimmy nods and walks up the street towards Syd's limo in the distance. 
INT. SYD'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS 
ROBERT Come on, get in. 
Jimmy enters. The limo drives off. 
JIMMY All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl! 
ROBERT Jimmy... 
JIMMY I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far. 
ROBERT It's gonna be okay. 
JIMMY Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be? 
ROBERT We've got you the best criminal lawyer-- 
JIMMY --Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him? 
ROBERT Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay? 
JIMMY Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault. 
SYD This isn't productive. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54.

{"train": "THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE \nWritten by \nPeter Stone \nBased on the Novel by \nJohn Godey \n16th April 1973 \nFADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES) \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY \nThe busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks; shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED: \nNow a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual face is visible because of his thick white hair, large bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker -- \"Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St.\" -- and appears quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs, CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign: \n\"SUBWAY.\" \nINT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY \nA level above the locals, two above the express trains. Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens. Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice: \n\"IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN..\" \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY \nGreen comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing the number \"10\", black on a white ground, indicating the point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the far end of the platform. \nSUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA). \nMED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR From the platform, featuring the conductor (BUD CARMODY) as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red hair. \nINT. FIFTH CAR \nThe door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing the younger man. \nMATSON C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can hear what you're doin'. \nBUD I'm checking the passengers getting on and off -- front and back -- okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut- ting the doors; -.rear section \nFIRST -- (pushes a button) -- then the front section -- \n(PUSHES ANOTHER) -- and -- the doors are closed. He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel. \nBUD Now I 'm checking the indicator box to make sure that the doors are all locked -- okay. The train starts with a jerk. \nBUD Igo back out the window -- \n(HE DOES) -- for a distance of three car- lengths to see that nobody's being dragged -- \n(RETURNING) -- I remove my door key -- and then the skate key -- and then I hit the transmitter button. (into a mike) Fifty-first Street' next stop -- the next stop is Fifty-first Street. (turning to Matson) How'd I do? \nCONTINUED \nMATSON How come you wanna be a conductor, anyway? Don't you know the con- ductor's sittin' in the goddam hotseat? \nBUD What do you mean, Mr. Matson? \nMATSON You're visible, for God's sake! Anything goes wrong -- anyone's got a gripe -- you're the one they see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years o' stickin' my head out there I been slugged, spit on, hit by purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers, baseball mitts -- an'.I been god- dam lucky! I never been puked on by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was on the Parkchester line -- or stabbed in the neck like I heard one fella was on the Astoria BMT -- \nBUD \n(QUIETLY) Jesus. \nMATSON You take my advice, kid -- serve your six months an' then put in for Motorman. Watch it, we're cumin' in. Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and hits his transmitter button. \nBUD \n(ANNOUNCING) \nFIFTY-NINTH STREET \nMATSON No it ain't \nBUD \n(CORRECTING) Fifty-first Street, sorry the station is Fifty-first Street. \nMATSON Never say you're sorry, kid -- somebody'll come back here an' bust your goddam nose. \nCONTINUED - 2 Bud sticks his head out the window, remembers what Matson told him and pulls it partially back in. \n51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train enters the station. We flash by the \"rear-enders\" (those I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses, slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc- tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away. \nPLATFORM - GREY RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down- track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark brown. \nINT. FOURTH CAR \nGrey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes. \nINT. FIRST CAR \nGreen has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before them, playing.: at driving the train. \nINT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB \nBROWN'S VOICE Turn around -- I 've got some- thing to show you. Bud turns back, inside the car, then looks down. \nCLOSE SHOT - REVOLVER The snub-nosed weapon has been pushed into Bud ' s midsec- tion. FREEZE FRAME. \n(MAIN TITLE CONTINUES) \nMED. CLOSE SHOT - BLUE & DOYLE Blue's .45 still against Doyle's cheek. Blue speaks calmly and quietly. \nBLUE Unlock your cab or. Doyle seems dazed, in a trance. Blue presses on the barrel of his gun, depressing Doyle's cheek. \nBLUE Pay attention to me. Open your cab door or I '.11 kill you. \nFREEZE FRAME. \n(MAIN TITLE CONTINUES) \nIT3T. FI TH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAE \nMED. SHOT - BROWN & BUD \nBROWN Come in and turn around -- slow. Brown, florist's box and all, has moved into the small cubicle. When Bud pulls his head in from outside they are very close. \nCLOSE SHOT - DOYLE'S HAND .as it gropes blindly for the latch, finds it and turns it with a click. The door opens and CAMERA TILTS UP to dis- cover Green standing outside. FREEZE FRAME. \n(MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS) \nINT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB \nBrown's gun is still pressed into Bud's side. \nBROWN Go back out the window and tell me what you see. Bud nods, licks his.dry lips and leans out, looking to the left, downtrack. \nFRONT CARS - BUD ' S POV Blue is still leaning against the head car, his back to us. \nBUD'S VOICE There's someone leaning against the head car. \nBROWN ' S VOICE The second he comes aboard shut the doors. Now Blue turns, picks up his valpac and trombone, enters the train and the doors close. \nINT. FIRST CAR - MOTORMAN ' S CAB \nas Green has moved in with his large package, a gun in his hand. Doyle stares at him, still terrified. \nGREEN Get rid of your seat. Doyle springs to his feet and swats up the folding seat with a clatter. \nDOYLE Yes, sir! \nGREEN Just take it easy. Now move over to the window -- and if you try to touch the mike pedal with your foot I'll shoot it off. \nCONTINUED A sharp rapping at the door and Green opens it. Blue squeezes in, placing his bags atop Green's package. it is becoming very crowded in the cab as Blue again pockets his gun. \nBLUE All right, Mr. Green? \nGREEN A hundred percent. \nBLUE Then get it started. Green moves over to face the controls. He stares down at them for a moment, then reaches with his left hand to the controller, his right to the brake handle. Pressing down firmly on the controller, he nudges it to the left. \nTWENTY-EIGHTH ST. PLATFORM as the train starts to move forward -- slowly. \nINT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB \nBrown still holding his gun on Bud. \nBROWN Okay -- announce the next station. Bud presses the transmitter button. \nI \nBUD \n(ANNOUNCING) Twenty-third Street -- next \nSTOP IS His voice croaks then fails -- he can't finish. Brown prods him with his gun. Bud clears his throat, then tries again. I \nBUD \n(ANNOUNCING) Next stop is Twenty-third Street. \nBROWN Come on -- we're. taking a walk up front. \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL \nas the train crawls slowly through the darkened tunnel. \nINT. FIRST CAR - MOTORMAN'S CAB \nGreen's eyes are on the controls as Blue and Doyle watch the track. \nGREEN You say when, Mr. Blue. \nBLUE Keep going -- \nDOYLE You're still in switching. Why don't you peg it up to series? You're green all the way through. \nGREEN We're in no hurry. \nSuddenly there's a popping sound and the power fails for a moment. \nBLUE What happened? \nGREEN She must've bucked. \nTwo men are walking at a rapid pace: CAZ DOLOWICZ, Super- vising Towerman, an overweight man in his fifties, and a PLUMBER, a short man dressed in overalls and a cap, carry- ing a long wooden box of wrenches; he struggles to keep up with Dolowicz. The time is SUPERIMPOSED: \nCONTINUED \nPLUMBER What's the goddam hurry? \nCAZ I told you -- one of my towermen dropped his wedding ring-down the john. \nPLUMBER Yeah, but what're we runnin' for? \nCAZ \n(RUNNING) Who's runnin'? They pass the Nedick's stand and Caz pushes through a gate marked: \"TO SUPER'S OFFICE\". \nPLUMBER How come that gate ain't locked? \nCAZ Who's gonna steal a subway train? \nINT. TUNNEL RAMP \nas Caz and the Plumber hurry along. - \nPLUMBER Christ, it stinks down herel Where the hell are we goin'? \nCAZ To the.Tower. \nPLUMBER Tower? Then what're we goin' down Hey, slow up, will ya? \nCAZ That's it up ahead -- those windows. \nPLUMBER What kinda tower? They've come to the door of the Tower Room. They turn, go up some steps and disappear inside. \nG \nINT. TOWER ROOM \nA long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and a door marked \"TOILET\". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS, a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however, i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements of every train that passes through the sector, all of it superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter. \nMARINO Jesus Christ, Caz\u00e2\u0080\u00a2, you picked a helluva day to be late -- \nCAZ You wanted a plumber down here, didn't you? Whose goddam wedding ring was it? \nMARINO \n(POINTING) Who else? Mrs. Jenkins. \nMRS. JENKINS I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz -- it just slipped off. \nCAZ What were you doin'r with your hand in the john, anyway? \nMRS. JENKINS (indignant). My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr. Dolowicz -- it was over the john. \nCAZ What's the difference? (to the Plumber) Go fish it out, will ya? As the Plumber heads off, Caz turns to Marino. \nCAZ The classification's been open to women for only a month and already we're in the goddam toilet! (glancing at the \nBOARD) What the hell's that? \nCONTINUED \nMARINO That's what I've been tryin' -to tell you, Caz -- a southbound local. He's laying down between 28th and 23rd. \nCAZ What the hell for? \nMARINO Dunno yet. \nCAZ How long? \nMARINO Couple-three minutes. Command Center's been trying to raise him but so far he don't answer the radio. Jesus, Caz -- why don't he answer the radio? \nCAZ Take it easy, Marino -- there's lots o' reasons. Maybe he jumped a ball and hadda leave the cab to reset a tripper -- or a door got hung and he hadda go fix it. Any- thing more serious and he'd'a called in for a car knocker. \nMARINO It's been too long, Caz -- \nCAZ Then maybe his radio's busted and the sonuvabitch is too lazy to climb down and use a telephone! I'm gonna write him up for.this, goddammit -- I'm gonna have his assn \nTOWERMAN Hey -- it's moving! Everyone wheels around to stare up at the Board. \nCAZ For Jesus Christ sake! The dumb bastard's moving backwards!! \nINT. SUBWAY TUNNEL \nSlowly, the second to the tenth cars are moving away from the first car which continues to lie motionless on the track. The rear cars roll about a hundred feet. \nINT. SECOND CAR - CAB \nas Green, leaning out the window and looking behind him, now applies the brake handle and the train grinds to a halt. \nINT. TOWER ROOM \nCaz, Marino and the others are staring up at the Model Board. \nMARINO He's stopped again! \nCAZ. Stopped is better than backwards. \nINT. SECOND CAR - CAB \nas Green removes the brake handle and the two keys, stuffs them back into his pockets and leaves the cab. \nJENKINS) Hey, Caz, take it easy, will you? \nCAZ If I gotta watch my language just because they let a few broads in' I'm gonna quit! How the hell. can you run a goddam railroad without swearing?! \nRADIO (CORRELL) Grand Central Tower -- this is the Desk Trainmaster -- who the fuck's in charge down there? Caz glances at Mrs. Jenkins, grins, and leans over a desk to flip on a mike. \nCAZ It's me, Frank --CazDolowicz. We're watchingitonthe Board. \nI RADIO (CORRELL) What good's watching it, for Chris- sake? We got trains piling up behind it. Get some goddam super- vision down there! \nCAZ On my way, Frank. \n(AN AFTERTHOUGHT) Oh, and Frank -- please don't say \"fuck\" anymore on the radio -- we got some ladies down here now -- and you know how it is with ladies, Frank--- the cunts don't like it. He flips off the key and walks out the door. \nINT. SUBC47AY -. FIRST CAR \nBlue maintains his position in min?-car. He turns now to the rear section. \nBLUE Everybody in this half of the car -- that's from here on back -- move up front, please. Everybody. (as they hesitate) Right now -- upi \nI \nCONTINUED As the. six or seven passengers in the rear section rise and move forward, the cab door opens and Doyle comes out, i followed by Green who is covering him with his gun. \nBLUE Get going, Mr. Green. Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps down onto the tracks. \nBLUE Motorman -- come here. \nDOYLE Yes, sir? \nBLUE I want you to walk uptrack and collect all the passengers in the nine cars we out loose, and lead them back to the 28th St. Station -- is that clear? \nDOYLE I People hate getting off in the middle of a tunnel -- \nBLUE Just do as you're told: The Hooker raises her hand. \nHOOKER Can I go with them, please?

What's happening is that you're all being held by four dangerous men with machine guns. \nOLD MAN \n(SMILING) I suppose. if you ask a foolish \nQUESTION The fluorescent lights suddenly go out and the emergency, incandescent bulbs immediately go on, thereby diminishing the brightness in the car by half. There's a general stirring among the Passengers as they look around them, their alarm peaking again. \nBLUE Please be quiet -- nothing's going to happen if you do as you're told. Get going, Motorman. As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears at the other. \nBLUE All right, Mr. Green? \nGREEN All power's out between 14th and 33rd Streets on all four tracks, local and express, north- and southbound. r \nBLUE I still see some tunnel lights. \nGREEN Emergency. They're on A.C. like the signals. \nBLUE (a pause). Stay here -- and leave the cab door open so you can hear the radio.

PLATFORM - TRAVELLING A train is standing with its doors open, and lit within only by the emergency bulbs. Caz hurries south along the platform, heading for the first car, his ample stomach bouncing over his low-slung belt, CAMERA LEADING him until he comes to the front of the train and stops to talk to the MOTORMAN, a grizzled old-timer who needs a shave. \nCAZ When did the power go? \nCONTINUED \nPMIOTORMAN Who wants to know? \nCAZ The Supervisor of the Grand Central Tower wants to know! \nMOTORMAN Oh -- sure -- it went a 'couple of minutes ago.

He breaks into a trot, only to slow to a walk and then stop as he sees something approaching in the darkness: a large CROWD of people, being guided by Doyle who uses a flashlight. Caz scratches his head. \nCAZ What now, for Chripsake? \nINT. SUBWAY - FIRST CAR \nas Blue surveys.the scene. The rear section is empty. The Sixteen remaining Passengers and Bud are sitting quietly.

CAMERA PANS to pick up Prescott as he leads his four Japanese through the room, moving and speaking rapidly. \nPRES COTT Each train is identified by the name of its terminus and the time of its departure --thus, an express leaving Woodlawn at 6:30 P.M. would be Woodlawn Six Three Oh, while on its return trip its new destination might be Flathush Eight Two Five. I hope you're memorizing all this junk -- I'm going to ask questions later. He has said this within earshot of a DISPATCHER who now reacts. \nDISPATCHER Jesus, Prescott, have you lost your marbles or what? \nPRESCOTT Don't worry -- they don't under- stand a word.

When I was a motorman I had nightmares about them falling off in front of me. \nE \nINT. 28TH STREET PLATFORM \nas the lone car passes slowly through. The long-stranded would-be RIDERS start to shout, whistle and bang on the windows and side of the. slowly passing car. \nINT. FIRST.

JENKINS) Continuing slow, at around five miles per hour -- what they call the switching position. \nDANIELS Prescott -- ? \nRADIO (PRESCOTT) Go ahead, Daniels.-- \nDANIELS I just had a terrible thought: what if they're not on the train? What if they set the throttle and jumped off? While we're chasing the train they're sneaking out an emergency exit somewhere behind us. \nRADIO (PRESCOTT) Ingenious -- except for one thing: it's impossible. \nDANIELS Why? \nRADIO. (PRESCOTT) A.little gizmo called the-dead man's feature. It was built into the controller handle in case a motorman should ever drop dead. It has to have a man's hand pressing down on it at all times in order to work. Otherwise the train stops cold. \nDANIELS Yeah? \nRADIO (PRESCOTT) Nice try, though. But in case \n(MORE) \nCONTINUED RADIO (PRESCOTi) (Contd ) you're- still worried, I was just about to call them. I'll let you know if I get their answering service. \nINT.

The track isn't clear to South Ferry yet -- how come you're moving? \nBLUE Slight change of plan. We decided to put some distance between us and all those cops you had hidden in the tunnel back there. \nRADIO \"(PRESCOTT) If you keep moving you're gonna start running into red signals. I don't want you to blame us for it. \nBLUE We'll be stopping soon. Just get back when you've cleared the rest of the track. Signing off. ' \nGREEN Do you think he's figured anything out? All those questions -- \nBLUE Perfectly natural under the circumstances. They're thinking just the way we want them to. \nINT. 18TH STREET PLATFORM \nClosed down for some years, the station platform is no more brightly lit than the rest of the tunnel, giving it an eerie look. The first car of Pelham One Two Three rolls slowly through. \nINT. MOTORMAN'S CAB \nBLUE Look sharp now -- it's coming \n", "test3_true": "BLUE Do you see it? \nGREEN It's that white light about a hundred feet ahead. \nBLUE All right -- this is close enough.

SUBWAY - FIRST CAR - MOTORMAN'S CAB \nBlue is hanging the mike back on its hook before lending Green a hand with the bulky valpac that originally came onto the train with Blue. \nRADIO.(PRESCOTT) Come in, Pelham.One Two Three this is Prescott calling -- can you hear me, Pelham One Two Three -- ? \nBLUE Ignore him -- he'll get tired and quit after a while. Let's get this stuff unpacked -- there isn't much time. They are unbuckling the straps and unfolding the canvas bag, then attacking the zipp`rs. \nCONTINUED \nRADIO (PRESCOTT) Come in, Pelham One Two Three -- INT. COIiTiAND CENTER - PRE- SCOTT - DAY \nPRESCOTT \n(INTO MIKE) Goddarani.t, Pelham One Two Three, what the hell's wrong with you -- ?! Still no answer. He sits back and thinks for a moment.

SUBWAY - FIRST CAR - IHiOTORF,IAN' S CAB \nCLOSE SHOT -- GLZ11CK as it is pulled from the valpac -- a cast-iron, shoe-like \nCONTINUED form with a molded, hollowed-out area on one side. It is clearly heavy enough to require both of Green's hands to heft it. CAitIE A PULLS BACK to reveal him, grunting, setting it over the controller handle which it fits perfectly. Blue stands by, watching. \nGREEN Perfect fit. Blue now hands him a length of pipe, some six inches in length. Green takes it, fits one end into a socket on top of the gimmick, facing toward the windshield, and screws it in. Then Blue hands him his submachine gun. Green looks at him for reassurance. \nBLUE Go ahead. Green attacks the windshield with tine stock of the gun, opening a great splintered hole. \nINT. SUBWAY CAR \nas the Passengers react to the sounds of breaking.glass coming from within the i iotorman's cab. \nINT. 14OTMMM'S CAB \nThe front window is almost completely out -- only a few pieces of glass cling to the frame. \nBLUE Get it all -- it's got to look right. Green uses the gun's barrel to scrape around the edges, clearing away the last traces of glass. Blue now hands Green another length of pipe -- this one about three feet long. Green fits one end over the protruding end of the attached short pipe -- not screwing it, merely fitting it. The other end extends straight out the glassless windshield. \nBLUE Try.it once -- make sure it comes away clean. Green yanks at the long pipe and it separates from the shorter one. \nGREEN Perfect. He reattaches it. \nCONTINUED \n"}

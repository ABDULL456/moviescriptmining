{"test1_input": "THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE \nWritten by \nPeter Stone \nBased on the Novel by \nJohn Godey \n16th April 1973 \nFADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES) \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY \nThe busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks; shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED: \nNow a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual face is visible because of his thick white hair, large bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker -- \"Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St.\" -- and appears quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs, CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign: \n\"SUBWAY.\" \nINT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY \nA level above the locals, two above the express trains. Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens. Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice: \n\"IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN..\" \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY \nGreen comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing the number \"10\", black on a white ground, indicating the point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the far end of the platform. \nSUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA). \nMED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR From the platform, featuring the conductor (BUD CARMODY) as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red hair. \nINT. FIFTH CAR \nThe door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing the younger man. \nMATSON C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can hear what you're doin'. \nBUD I'm checking the passengers getting on and off -- front and back -- okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut- ting the doors; -.rear section \nFIRST -- (pushes a button) -- then the front section -- \n(PUSHES ANOTHER) -- and -- the doors are closed. He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel. \nBUD Now I 'm checking the indicator box to make sure that the doors are all locked -- okay. The train starts with a jerk. \nBUD Igo back out the window -- \n(HE DOES) -- for a distance of three car- lengths to see that nobody's being dragged -- \n(RETURNING) -- I remove my door key -- and then the skate key -- and then I hit the transmitter button. (into a mike) Fifty-first Street' next stop -- the next stop is Fifty-first Street. (turning to Matson) How'd I do? \nCONTINUED \nMATSON How come you wanna be a conductor, anyway? Don't you know the con- ductor's sittin' in the goddam hotseat? \nBUD What do you mean, Mr. Matson? \nMATSON You're visible, for God's sake! Anything goes wrong -- anyone's got a gripe -- you're the one they see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years o' stickin' my head out there I been slugged, spit on, hit by purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers, baseball mitts -- an'.I been god- dam lucky! I never been puked on by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was on the Parkchester line -- or stabbed in the neck like I heard one fella was on the Astoria BMT -- \nBUD \n(QUIETLY) Jesus. \nMATSON You take my advice, kid -- serve your six months an' then put in for Motorman. Watch it, we're cumin' in. Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and hits his transmitter button. \nBUD \n(ANNOUNCING) \nFIFTY-NINTH STREET \nMATSON No it ain't \nBUD \n(CORRECTING) Fifty-first Street, sorry the station is Fifty-first Street. \nMATSON Never say you're sorry, kid -- somebody'll come back here an' bust your goddam nose. \nCONTINUED - 2 Bud sticks his head out the window, remembers what Matson told him and pulls it partially back in. \n51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train enters the station. We flash by the \"rear-enders\" (those I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses, slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc- tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away. \nPLATFORM - GREY RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down- track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark brown. \nINT. FOURTH CAR \nGrey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes. \nINT. FIRST CAR \nGreen has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before them, playing.: at driving the train. \nINT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB \n", "test1_true": "BUD \n(ANNOUNCING) Grand Central Station, next stop -- the next stop is Grand Central. \nMATSON Yeah -- if I was you I'd start studyin' for that motorman's exam right now. \nCONTINUED \nBUD To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson, I have been. Want to hear some- thing? \n(RECITING) Every car on the IRT is seventy-two feet long, cost $250,000 and weighs 75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats with room for 136 standing. \nMATSON 'Cept at rush hour when you can push in another 20, at least. Honest to God, I. know personally of a case where this guy on a number 5 train dies of a heart attack at Union Square and he has t' wait until the Grand Concourse in the Bronx before enough people get off so's he can fall down. \n(A PAUSE) Honest to God. \nBUD Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me last week said that happened on a double -A train on the West Side. \nMATSON Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A wop or an American? \n(LOOKING OUT) Here's where I'm gettin' off -- think you can get to Brooklyn Bridge all by yourself? \nBUD \n(GRINNING) Long as I don't have 'to drive -- \nMATSON Stick with it, kid -- you're doin' great. See ya t'morrow. He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates. Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson as he does. \nBUD Grand Central Station -- change for the express. This is Grand Central. \nCONTINUED - 2 \nIN The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out, colliding with a very large man (BROW^?PN) who is in a hurry to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white, bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen- long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves. \nMATSON What's your hurry, chief? We won't leave without you. Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the front of the car. \nINT. FIRST CAR - GREEN \nStill sitting, still facing the motorman's cab. The two boys continue to play at the front window. The doors can be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion. \nBUD'S VOICE \n(AMPLIFIED) Thirty-third Street -- next stop is Thirty-third Street . Suddenly Green's hand,clutches at his shirt collar, unbut- toning the top button and loosening his tie. He breathes a sigh of relief, ' then notices that his left leg is vibrat- ing. He quickly stills it by placing a hand on his knee. \nINT. FOURTH CAR - GREY \nLeaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively. Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and starts forward through the car, heading for the third car. At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door, leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and waits a moment. Finally: \nGREY Your ass. The man looks around and surveys Grey. \nCONTINUED \nNSFN What about it? \nGREY Move it. The man glances at Grey for a moment, then moves it. Grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform between the two cars. \nTWENTY-EIGHTH STREET PLATFORM \nCLOSE SHOT - STATION DESIGNATION The tile mosaics spelling out \"28TH STREET.\" CAMERA now DOLLIES to a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of still another man with a white bushy mustache, white hair, dark glasses, slouch hat, gloves and raincoat -- BLUE. The time is SUPERIMPOSED: \"2a 01. \" \nWIDER ANGLE Blue stands at the downtown end of the platform, near the number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on the northbound express track, its lights flashing between the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies. Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant PIMP's fashions -- flaring double-knit trousers, three- inch heels, wide-lapeled jacket and white, extra-wide- brimmed hat, swaggers, loose-jointed, to a spot near Blue and waits, cool and relaxed. He becomes aware of Blue observing him. \nPIMP What's wrong, dude -- ain't you .never seen a sunset.before? Blue-smiles softly and looks uptrack. \nINT. FIRST CAR - GREEN \nBUD'S VOICE \n(AMPLIFIED) Twenty-eighth Street -- next stop is Twenty-eighth Street. Green glances at his watch, then turns to look at the storm door at the far end of the car. \nGREY - GREEN' S POV The far storm door -- with Grey's face seen through the glass. \nTIGHT CLOSE SHOT - GREEN as he nods to Grey. \nINT. SECOND CAR \nas Grey comes back inside, closes the door and wedges his hip securely against the brass handle. \nTWENTY-EIGHTH ST. PLATFORM - LOCAL TRACK as the train roars in, brakes,' and grinds to a stop. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on a sign on the side of the first car: \"PELHAM BAY PARK\" until only \"PELHAM\" fills the SCREEN. \nMED. SHOT - BLUE He hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the train, then, without haste, carrying the valpac in one hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the front of the first car. The Motorman (DENNY DOYLE), a middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of the rest of the train. \nDOYLE Hey -- how do you expect me to -- ? He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has placed the muzzle against his (Doyle's) head. Doyle jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against the windowframe. Blue crooks his hand inside the window and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek, directly under his right eye. \nDOYLE \n(TERRIFIED) For God's sake --.what do you want? \nBLUE I'm taking your train. \nFREEZE FRAME. \n(MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS) \nMED.

CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Meet your new client, Eric Knox. 
KNOX First off, thank you. You rescued me, for which I am eternally grateful. 
He's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall most upon Dylan. She notices it. 
KNOX (CONT'D) But there's still a problem. Whoever kidnapped me wasn't just trying to screw up our IPO. They also stole the proprietary software for our new web browser. I'm sure it was Roger Corwin, but I need proof. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE That's where you come in, Angels. 
CIRCLING AROUND, we see the video images of Corwin and the Red Star Systems logo on the big screen. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) We need to break into Red Star's computer systems to see if Mr. Knox's software is indeed being converted for Red Star's use. 
NATALIE Sounds like a plan. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red Star's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility. We're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system, and the best way to get that is through Mr. Corwin himself.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 44. 
CONTINUED: 
A video image of Corwin's Palm Pilot Schedule comes up the bigscreen. The shot pulls in close on "SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY." 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) We need to pin a camera on him to get footage of the inside of the building. Thanks to Alex's work at the health spa, we know that Corwin will be at the San Diego Speedway on Thursday. Get close to him Angels, but don't tip your hand. 
ALEX Consider it done. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr. Knox's security. I'd hate to have him kidnapped again. 
DYLAN Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer if you could join us, Charlie. 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER 
From Charlie's P.O.V., looking up at the sunlight.      Three manta-rays swim above us. 
We can hear the BUBBLES from Charlie's regulator. 
CHARLIE I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a bit over my head at the moment. 
A manta-ray swims past, super-close, letting us... 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. KNOX HOUSE - DUSK 
A majestic craftsman in the hills, Frank Lloyd Wright meets conspicuous consumption. 
INT. KNOX HOUSE ATTIC - DUSK 
A flashlight beam sweeps past, revealing Dylan. With just her shoulders above the rafters, she's checking a dusty crawl space. She finds nothing suspicious. 
INT. KNOX'S WALK-IN CLOSET - DUSK 
Knox stands below, Dylan's boots on his shoulders. The heels dig in a bit, but he's not complaining. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                45. 
CONTINUED: DYLAN We're good. 
He moves to help her down, but she does a reverse-pullup to handle it by herself. She leads the way... 
INT. KNOX'S BEDROOM - DUSK 
The room is huge. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, we see that we're up in the hills. 
Knox follows her as she walks. 
DYLAN I've got surveillance on all the windows. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone. 
We continue... 
INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - DUSK 
Just as big, just as beautiful. Knox, or his decorator, has great taste. Everything is top quality, but unpretentious. 
DYLAN Also, stay away from the windows. 
KNOX They're bullet-proof.   The last owner was paranoid. 
DYLAN (a smile) Lucky for us. 
She takes a marker-sized device off the table. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) This is a panic button. (tosses it to him) Press it and one of us can be here in ten minutes. 
KNOX Which one of you? 
DYLAN Whoever's closest. 
She takes her jacket off the couch, ready to go. 
KNOX I have a better idea.

EXT. COFFEE KIOSK - TIJUANA - DAY 
Javi buys a cup of coffee.  He turns.  Two men, who will come to be known as AGENT HUGHES and AGENT JOHNSON, are standing close.  Agent Hughes speaks without looking at him. 
HUGHES The word going around is you're not that happy in your work. (beat) Maybe we can help. 
Hughes sticks a business card in Javi's pocket.  Javi watches them walk away.  It's all done so smoothly and quickly, it's over before Javi even knows what happened. 
EXT. WEST END - CINCINNATI - DAY 
It's the bad part of urban Cincinnati in the daylight: projects and blighted row houses.  Seth and Caroline walk with a slouched, alert air.  In their mind's eye they are prep-school gangsters following a familiar route. 
SETH You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons -- 
CAROLINE Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- 
SETH Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day. 
CAROLINE Have you done your homework, honey? 
SETH Yes, mom -- 
CAROLINE Then here's a little bump. 
They turn down a street with a lot of activity on it. 
SETH Drugs weren't even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem. Opiates.  But, who was using 'em? Chinese immigrants.  Slave labor. And the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music.  People on the fringe. Artists.  Decadent rich people.  And who got scared?  White men in power. Who's scared today?  White men in power.  If J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller ever admitted using, it'd be a whole different story. 
TWO YOUNG STREET DEALERS fall in step with them.  One talks without moving his lips -- 
STREET DEALER What you want? 
SETH 911, and the come down. 
One dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling- down building. 
STREET DEALER How much? 
SETH Two hundred of C, hundred of the other. 
The dealer looks them over.  He looks behind them down the street. 
CAROLINE Come on... We've been here before. 
STREET DEALER Then, let's see your money. 
Seth and Caroline are suspicious.  They carefully show money they both have in their front right pockets.  The dealer feints like he might grab it. 
STREET DEALER Up the steps.  You the experts.  You know what to do. 
They hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone. 
INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY 
They step into the narrow foyer between the outer door and the inner door.  There are three other PEOPLE waiting nervously.  An older JUNKIE shoots them a crazy look -- 
JUNKIE What are you two, about twelve? 
CAROLINE Fuck off. 
They wait.  Finally, the first dealer appears in the inner door and lets them through. 
INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY 
They wait in a line in the narrow, poorly lit corridor.  At the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the drugstore is open.  People buy and leave. 
Seth and Caroline approach.  In the hatch is a hardened dealer, 20's, named SKETCH, which is tattooed on his forearm. He checks out Caroline's body. 
SETH Caroline, give me your money. 
She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911." 
Caroline has been watching the transaction.  Sketch makes slow eye contact with Caroline.  After a beat -- 
SKETCH Goodbye... Caroline. 
Seth and Caroline make their way out of the building. 
SETH (under his breath) Yeah, right. 
EXT. BUILDING - DAY 
Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps. The lookout speaks without moving his lips. 
STREET DEALER Now, get the fuck out of here. 
Caroline stops suddenly.  She pulls Seth to her and kisses him hard.  There's no better moment than the one right after scoring before you start using. 
EXT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY 
A flophouse of the seediest variety: wino in the doorway, prostitute taking care of business, everyone fresh out of institutions and graveyards. 
INT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY 
They approach the front desk which is behind six inches of glass. 
SETH We'd like room 205. 
DESKMAN Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars. 
INT. ROOM 205 - VILLA ELAINE - DAY 
They enter and the light bulb goes out.  Seth fumbles his way to the mini-fridge, which he opens, throwing feeble light across the floor. 
They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the black and white television bolted to the bureau.  The mini- fridge.  Caroline bounces on the bed.  They are teenagers.

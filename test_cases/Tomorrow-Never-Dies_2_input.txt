INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT - 
Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion. 
INT. BRIDGE - 
Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead captain, and pushes the body out. 
EXT. PASSAGEWAY - 
With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship. 
(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.) 
Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the passageway, then pokes his head inside - 
And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown against a railing. 
Bond looks up: 
STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached to the boom by a thin metal cable. 
STAMPER You're mine now. 
Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch. With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck. 
As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a wall, and THE WORM comes to life. 
Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm. 
Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond against the wall with his free hand as he - 
MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD. 
With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose - 
STAMPER I'm going to do this slowly - 
Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm - 
But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is rushing at Bond full force, with the worm. 
Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews into the wall. 
Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond. 
INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE - 
With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in the cable, on the ground. 
RETURN TO SCENE - 
Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain - 
And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP. 
UNDERWATER - 
The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull. 
SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) - 
Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall. 
HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) - 
HARMSWAY (barking into the radio) Stamper! Report in! 
EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY - 
As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick - 
HARMSWAY'S VOICE (continuing, on Stamper's radio) Report to the bridge! 
BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing taught as the worm wends its way underwater. 
Stamper rushes Bond - 
And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around Stamper's neck. 
Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and - 
STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as - 
INT. STORAGE CABIN - 
THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in, pushing Sidney off to one side. 
WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN - 
It's zooming at the door! 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - 
The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway. 
INT. BRIDGE - 
The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a wall, cutting his head. 
EXT. THE DECK - 
As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge, using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper: 
First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - 
Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the rising water and the ceiling. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - 
3/4 filled with water. Rising fast. 
THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY) 
The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in front of us, as the worm bursts into - 
THE ENGINE ROOM. 
With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL." 
EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - 
The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when: THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE. 
INT. BRIDGE - 
Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the incline, to the port-side door. 
Just when he thinks he's made it -

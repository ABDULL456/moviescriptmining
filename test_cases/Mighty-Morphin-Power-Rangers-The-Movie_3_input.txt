Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice. 
ALPHA 5 Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late. 
AISHA What?! 
ALPHA 5 Zordon...  he's gone. 
The Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's lifeless form looking absolutely devastated. 
KIMBERLY ... This can't be... 
They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're utterly defeated. 
Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent voice. 
TOMMY "To those who possess the Great Power...   all things are possible." 
The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle around Zordon and interlock hands. 
They close their eyes, bow their heads... 
After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM. 
Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING, STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION. 
When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM. 
Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride. 
RANGERS ZORDON!! 
ZORDON Welcome back, kids. 
ADAM It's good to be back. 
Alpha jumps up and down like a child. 
ALPHA 5 HE'S ALIVE!  HE'S ALIVE! 
KIMBERLY We thought you... 
ZORDON It's good to see you again, too. 
Alpha sees the Ecto-Morphicon machines on the VIEWING GLOBE. 
ALPHA  5 AI, YI, YI, YI, YI   Ivan s Ecto- Morphicon machines are leveling the city! 
ROCKY We've got news for you, Ivan... 
TOMMY The Power Rangers are BACK IN BUSINESS!! 
They TELEPORT out. 
79   EXT.   ANGEL GROVE TOWER - NIGHT                            79 
CLOSE ON IVAN as he TURNS INTO CAMERA, a startled look on his face. 
IVAN 
I... SMELL... 
He looks down on the street as the COLUMNS OF LIGHT SHOOT DOWN AND THE POWER RANGERS APPEAR. 
IVAN (outraged) POWER RANGERS! 
80   EXT.  CITY STREETS                                          80 
The Rangers watch as Hornitor and Scorpitron come THUNDERING down the street toward them. 
KIMBERLY What're THOSE?! 
We hear Alpha on Tommy's wrist communicator. 
ALPHA 5  (V. 0.) Rangers, call for your new animal Zords! 
TOMMY Let's DO it!

EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - DAY 
A pair of arms are protruding from the surface of the planet, still holding Mantis aloft. 
The earth falls away, and Drax, who was entirely covered, heaves for breath. 
EXT. CRACK IN PLANET - DAY 
The TENDRILS FALL, freeing Gamora and Nebula as they GASP. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY 
Yondu BREAKS THROUGH THE ROCKS around him, drawing in breath. 
The TENTACLES HOLDING ROCKET ALOFT CRUMBLE, and he looks around, confused. 
EARTH - EXT. ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI - DAY 
The WAVE PUSHES UP against the back of Grandpa Quill's CAMARO and suddenly STOPS: 
the mountainous plant, a hundred stories high, is up against the back of the car. 
EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
The Easik Mother clutching her baby looks behind her; the wave has stopped. 
She clutches her baby to her chest, relieved. 
INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY 
The tunnel around Groot SNAPS BACK to what it was. Once more he can see the light at the tunnel's end, and one looks like a GIANT BRAIN composed of prismatic light. 
He RUNS forward. 
INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY 
Rocket flies up and yells at Groot. 
ROCKET Groot! Groot, if you can can hear me, hurry up - I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted! 
INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY 
Groot ARRIVES at the end of the tunnel, and stops there. 
The center of the core holds a huge cosmic placenta, and, within that, EGO'S TRUE SELF, the COSMIC BRAIN. It ROILS FURIOUSLY, the reflection of its fight with Quill, thrashing around within this womb. 
Although afraid, Groot places the bomb on the placenta. 
Groot stares at both buttons, scared - he doesn't know which one to pick. 
Groot makes a decision on which button to press. He goes to push the death button. 
Then his finger STOPS just millimeters from the button, TREMBLING. He thinks... 
And then changes the course of his finger, PUSHING THE CORRECT BUTTON. 
THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK COMMENCES. 
Baby Groot turns, terrified, and RUNS. 
I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY 
Drax moves with Mantis into the loading bay.    He throws her down and climbs up a ladder. 
THE CAMERA SWINGS TO GAMORA AND NEBULA, climbing up to the surface in the dirt storm. 
INT. PLANETS HOLLOW - DAY 
Ego RISES on his own MOLECULAR TORNADO and STRIKES BACK at Quill. He YELLS as he SLAMS Quill against the wall, DRAGGING his face along the wall. 
He TOSSES Quill into a another wall. 
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY 
QUILL brings his ARM FILLED WITH LIGHT away from the wall, so that he causes a WAVE OF LIGHT AND ROCK around the interior of the hollow, FLYING TO EGO and knocking him aside. 
Yondu protects his face as DIRT SWIRLS in the wake of the Quill/Ego battle. 
Rocket, carrying Groot, FLIES BACK DOWN beside him. 
ROCKET Yondu! We're about to blow! 
YONDU Get to the ship. 
ROCKET Not without Quill. 
YONDU You gotta take care of the twig. 
ROCKET Not without you. 
YONDU I ain't done nothing right my whole damn life, rat. You need to give me this. 
Rocket, hesitantly, nods.    He grabs some things from his bag. He hands them to Yondu. 
ROCKET A space suit and an aero rig. I only have one of each. 
Yondu nods. Rocket nods too. 
Rocket starts to go, but STOPS and looks at Yondu. 
He wants to say something, but he doesn't know what. Baby Groot does. 
GROOT I am Groot. 
YONDU What's that? 
ROCKET He says welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy... only he didn't use `frickin'. 
YONDU Bye, twig. 
Groot waves. 
And Rocket FLIES UP toward the surface. Rocket mutters to Groot. 
ROCKET We're gonna need to have a discussion about your language.

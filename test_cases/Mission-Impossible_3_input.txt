ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a place to hide. 
ETHAN OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors. 
SARAH What about my coat?  I'll freeze. 
JACK (O.S.) I don't have it. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 
PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing.

The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator drops to just over their heads and stops. 
INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT 
GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a microphone. 
ETHAN He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. 
JACK (O.S.) Give me a break, Pops. 
SARAH Such a nice ass. 
JACK (O.S.) And a lonely ass. 
ETHAN Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes. 
CLAIRE (O.S.) Roger that. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft. 
EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes and SPARKS. 
EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT 
ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous couple. 
ETHAN In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll. 
JACK (O.S.) Roger that.  Opening doors now. 
ETHAN Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport. 
ETHANíS voice comes over HANNAHíS earpiece. 
HANNAH En route. 
HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs. 
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
The button marked "ROOF" lights up, seemingly all by itself. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT 
The car engages with a sharp jolt -- 
JACK Hey.

GRÍMA So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill. 
[Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other intently.] 
ÉOWYN Your words are poison! 
[Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.] 
GIMLI Youll find more cheer in a graveyard. 
[Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared. The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.] 
GANDALF [sees Háma] Ah. 
HÁMA I cannot allow you before Théoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gríma Wormtongue. 
[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons. Aragon hands over his sword and knives. Legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.] 
HÁMA [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff. 
GANDALF Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.] 
[Háma hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas arm.] 
GRÍMA [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe. 
GANDALF The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King. 
[As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants. A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.] 
GRÍMA [Whispering to Théoden.] Hes not welcome. 
THÉODEN Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.] 
GRÍMA A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. 
GANDALF Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gríma.] 
GRÍMA His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff! 
[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. Gamling tries to go forward but Háma holds him back.] 
GANDALF Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows. 
[Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.] 
GIMLI [Growls] I would stay still, if I were you. 
GANDALF Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand] 
THÉODEN [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey! 
[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, exuding blinding white light. Théoden is thrown back against his seat.] 
THÉODEN Argh! 
GANDALF [Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.

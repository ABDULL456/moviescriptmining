Leonard is losing it. 
LEONARD I want my fucking life back! 
Jimmy SWINGS at Leonard with a BROKEN FLOORBOARD, STRIKING his shoulder. The jack handle goes flying. Jimmy SWINGS again, misses. Leonard GRABS him, taking him down. The two of them STRUGGLE on the floor. Leonard gets ON TOP of Jimmy, CHOKING him. Jimmy tries to speak, but can only make GURGLING noises. As Leonard watches Jimmy fight for air we:

Leonard's wife THRASHES her head from side to side, STRUGGLING to breathe though the clear plastic shower curtain. 
BACK TO SCENE: 
167	  INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY - ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 
Jimmy's arms THRASH, his hands catching Leonard's face, SCRATCHING his cheek. Leonard tips his head back and increases his efforts. Jimmy STOPS struggling. Leonard keeps his hands around Jimmy's throat until he is confident that he is DEAD. 
Leonard BREATHES as he stands up. He nods to himself with satisfaction. He looks around for his POLAROID CAMERA. He snaps a FLASH picture of Jimmy's body, and stares intently at the POLAROID as it begins to DEVELOP. 
We see the IMAGE OF THE STRANGLED JIMMY appear <COLOUR>>(POST)

Leonard stands above Jimmy's body, examining the picture he has just taken, nodding to himself, catching his breath.

Leonard grabs Jimmy' s body by the legs, DRAGGING him back	 * towards the basement. He opens the door and BACKS down into the DARKNESS, pulling Jimmy behind him. 
169  INT. BASEMENT OF DERELICT BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS	   169 
Leonard BACKS DOWN the stairs, dragging Jimmy's BODY, head BUMPING down each step. In the middle of the room, Leonard DROPS the legs. Moving fast, Leonard pulls the BEIGE SUIT	  * TROUSERS from the body, REMOVES HIS OWN SCRUFFY JEANS AND	  * PLAID WORK SHIRT. Leonard dresses in Jimmy's BLUE SHIRT and	* BEIGE SUIT. He grabs the Polaroids from his PLAID WORK SHIRT    * and sticks them in his suit jacket pocket. He dumps his old	* clothes onto Jimmy's body. A faint RASPING comes from Jimmy's   * throat. Leonard, frightened, bends down to listen. 
JIMMY (barely and audible rasp) Sammy... remember Sammy... 
Leonard is SHOCKED. Jimmy is silent. The sound of a CAR outside. Leonard JUMPS to his feet. 
170  INT. KITCHEN, DERELICT BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS <SEQUENCE>> 
Leonard looks out to see Teddy getting out of his GREY SEDAN. Leonard leafs through his Polaroids finding the one of Teddy. There is nothing on the back. He sticks his Polaroids back in his pocket, pausing at the one of the STRANGLED JIMMY. 
LEONARD (V.0.)						* What have I done?							  * 
171  EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>		   171 
Leonard emerges to find Teddy trying the Jaguar's doors. 
LEONARD (distraught) Hey! Mister! I need help! 
Teddy looks up. 
TEDDY What's wrong? 
LEONARD There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor! 
Teddy moves towards the house. Leonard leads him in.

Teddy follows Leonard down the darkened hall. 
LEONARD (panicked) He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you? 
TEDDY No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing? 
LEONARD Maybe. Maybe just. 
They go down into the basement. 
173  INT. BASEMENT OF DERELICT BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS	   173 
Teddy follows Leonard down the stairs. Jimmy's body, dressed only in boxers, lies in the middle of the floor. 
TEDDY So what were you doing here? 
Teddy moves to the body and crouches down to examine it. 
LEONARD I don't know. See, I have this condition. 
TEDDY Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead. 
Leonard CRACKS Teddy over the head with the FLOORBOARD.	    * 
TEDDY (cont'd)						* FUCK, Lenny! That fucking kills! 
LEONARD Remember me again, huh? 
Leonard FRISKS him, pulling out a GUN and a POLICE BADGE.	  * 
LEONARD (cont'd)					   * You're a cop. A fucking cop.					 *

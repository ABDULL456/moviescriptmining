{"train": "Shooting past D'Angelo and Sidney towards the bandstand. \nD'ANGELO That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great. \nSIDNEY And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank. \nD'Angelo looks quickly at Sidney, sensing the undercurrent. Then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a quiet tone. \nD'ANGELO Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month... \nSIDNEY (after a pause) See my mother? \nD'ANGELO (shaking his head) I only had a few hours. \nA glum moment.  Frank sips his highball: Sidney lights a cigarette, animosity on his face. \nD'ANGELO Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow. \nSIDNEY (begrudgingly) Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys. \nFrank again notes Sidney's resentful manner.  Sidney looks towards the musicians. \nSIDNEY (quietly) Frank, I think maybe you lied to me. \nD'ANGELO (quietly) Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar? \nSIDNEY (looking towards Steve) You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you? \nD'ANGELO Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age. \nSIDNEY (narrowly) You told him that? \nD'ANGELO Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got. \nA pause.  Sidney is thinking. \nSIDNEY When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road? \nD'ANGELO Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks. \nSIDNEY That's a nice tour.  All booked? (Frank nodding) When was Susie around here last? \nD'ANGELO Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood. \nSIDNEY (abruptly) Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth. \nD'ANGELO (annoyed) I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl... \nRITA \nLocating Sidney, she comes up behind him.  He turns away from D'Angelo as she whispers to him.  As she departs, Sidney turns back. \nSIDNEY If you knew Hunsecker as well as I did, you might understand why it's my business.  Maybe you're walking around blind, Frank, without a cane. \nSidney gets off his stool.  Casually, but to effect, he adds: \nSIDNEY ...and in case you didn't know it, Susie Hunsecker's out there on the back step right now. \nHe turns away, glancing towards Steve on the bandstand behind him. \nD'ANGELO \nHe looks disturbed. \nINT./EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD \nFrom D'Angelo's point of view.  CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve. The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving rhythm of considerable excitement.  A waiter passes in f.g. and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to the backstage part of the club.  This movement is continued as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near the fire-exit.  As he steps out of the door to discard a cigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.  Here, it discovers the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nThis is SUSAN HUNSECKER.  She wears an expensive mink coat. It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.  A girl in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her capacity.  Over scene, the music continues.  Susan shifts her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an end and that the musicians will be coming backstage. \nINT. ELYSIAN ROOM \nSteve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole group now in unison. \nQUINTET \nThe music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish.  There is some applause.  The boys relax.  Steve reaches for the microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of the \"cool\" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking the audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing the intermission pianist.  During this, Carson, Chico and Paul wander off the bandstand behind him. \nEXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD \nChico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage. As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees Susan in the courtyard.  He goes out onto the fire-escape; Paul following behind. \nCHICO Hi!  Susie... \nSUSAN Hello, Chico.  Paul. \nCHICO (to Paul) Throw a rope round this chick while I go get Steve. \nChico goes swiftly back into the club.  Paul remains with Susan.  There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed because Susan is.  Susan makes an effort at conversation, she nods towards the club. \nSUSAN Full house...? \nPAUL Packin' 'em in. \nINT. CLUB \nSteve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a much-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz. \nDEVOTEE I'm terribly interested in jazz -- serious jazz.  You studied with Milhaud, didn't you?  This is such an interesting fusion of the traditional, classical form with the new progressive style, I just wanted to ask you how you came to form the group...- \nCHICO \nHe comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he sees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSteve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual Young Woman.  Seeing that Chico has something to say to him, he wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the buck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz, who is descending from the bandstand behind him. \nSTEVE Well, we just sort of got together. (turning to introduce Fred) Maybe if you ask Mr. Katz...He writes the stuff, you know. \nFRED (blankly) Huh? \nRESUME CHICO \nSteve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the corridor outside. \nCORRIDOR \nThey laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the CAMERA MOVES, we realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them; his manner is affable. \nSIDNEY Can more than two enjoy this joke... (to Susan) Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to find you here. \nSteve says nothing.  But he obviously resents the intrusion and finds it difficult to conceal the fact.  Sidney comes down the fire escape towards them. \nSIDNEY Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them - \nSTEVE (barely polite) Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it. (to Susan) It's cold out here, Susie. \nSteve makes a move to lead Susan back inside.  It is a gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney.  Sidney chooses to take umbrage: \nSIDNEY (lightly sarcastic) Let me apologize for getting you that press spread.  It's been an honor to serve you gratis. \nSteve turns to Sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging: \nSTEVE (levelly) I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around... \nSUSAN (quickly intervening) Steve, stop it please... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFrank D'Angelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape; other members of the Quintet have also appeared. \nD'ANGELO What are you boys fighting about? \nAggressively indignant, Sidney throws up his hands; he knocks on the metal of the fire escape. \nSIDNEY (sarcastic) Kill me!  Find me a door somewhere - I walked in without knocking! \nSidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it. \nSTEVE I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night? \nSIDNEY (needling) Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years! \nD'ANGELO (soothingly) Come on boys, break it up... \nSTEVE (overriding D'Angelo) The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man! \nSIDNEY \nHis face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty.  He turns his back swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a sharp edge. \nSIDNEY If you're going home, Susie, I'll drop you off... \nSidney starts quickly up the fire escape.  This makes Steve angry and he steps forward to follow him.  But Chico contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve. \nCHICO (easily) Time for the next set, Chief... \nSTEVE Just a minute, Chico. \nCORRIDOR \nSidney comes inside.  When he is out of sight or the group in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes.  It's obvious now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes; he is assessing Steve's temper.  But, presently, seeing D'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the curtains into the Club. \nCOURTYARD \nAs D'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back to Susan. \nSTEVE (fondly) Just so you don't leave me in a minor key. \nINT. CLUB \nRita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance to the club.  Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again. \nSIDNEY Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha? \nRITA (shaking her head) No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do. \nSidney is amused.  Rita continues in a confidential manner which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very- convincing air of injury. \nRITA (soto voce) He came in last week on a very dull rainy night.  I know who he was, but I didn't let on. (emphatically) He didn't take his eyes off me all night.  Listening...? \nRita has mistaken Sidney's shrewdly calculating expression for inattention. \nSIDNEY Avidly.  He was staring. \nRITA (continuing) Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on. \nSIDNEY (prompting) He was writing a special Sunday piece on...? \nRITA (nodding) ...cigarette girls... And naturally - \nSIDNEY You were thrilled to be interviewed. (she nods) Were you \"interviewed\"? \nRITA In his apartment - \nSIDNEY And where was his wife? \nRITA I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened. \nSIDNEY (grimacing) We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house? \nRITA (with a nod) But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning! \nDespite himself, Sidney chuckles; but she is distressed. \nRITA For a moment I was so taken aback that I said anything that popped into my sleepy head.  If I'm not mistaken, I even ordered the man out of his own house. \nSidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end of the big room. \nSTEVE AND SUSAN \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Susan has come back into the club with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him.  She starts to walk through the club on her way out. \nRESUME SIDNEY AND RITA \nSidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens to Rita's rueful protest. \nRITA (rapidly) He was furious and, by the time I could have put on a Tropical Island mood, I was out on the street!... (dolefully) That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me into his office here.  He's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists.  I told him I still have Sonny at military academy, but Van Cleve's made of ice... \nAware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal: \nRITA (tentative) Do you think you could do something, Sidney? \nSIDNEY (a quick nod) That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe... \nRita is anxious to cement the offer.  Delicately, she asks: \nSIDNEY Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...! \nSusan ignores his remark, continuing thoughtfully: \nSUSAN I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act. \nSIDNEY (with an indignant edge) Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do! \nThe taxi has pulled to a stop.  Susan sits for a moment before she remarks. \nSUSAN The act would be for my sake, not Steve's... \nRealizing that they have come to their destination, Susan gets up, moving out of CAMERA as she disembarks from the taxi.  CAMERA catches a glimpse of apprehension in Sidney's eyes.  Quickly, he decides to follow her. \nEXT. BROADWAY \nSusan, getting out of the taxi, moves past CAMERA.  Sidney, following her, instructs the driver. \nSIDNEY (to cabbie) Wait for me.  I'll be right back. \nLONGER SHOT \nSidney moves after the girl, calling: \"Susie!\" \nSUSAN \nHearing him, Susan turns back.  Sidney walks into shot to join her. \nSIDNEY (lightly) It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle... \nSUSAN (smiling) But I don't need an uncle, Sidney. \nThey move through the doors. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSidney quickly corrects himself, saying earnestly: \nSIDNEY No, I mean because I admire you - in fact, more than admire you - although that's neither here nor there. (quickly skipping to the important point) Susie, don't sell your brother short.  Talk this over with him, I mean - you'll find him a real friend. \nSUSAN \nSusan looks thoughtful, making no comment. \nRESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN \nCarefully (again probing) he prompts her: \nSIDNEY Any message, in case I see J.J. later? \nSusan turns away and walks out past CAMERA.  Sidney watches her. \nSUSAN \nShe looks back at Sidney, quietly firm. \nSUSAN Yes.  Tell him for me that Steve Dallas is the first real man I've ever been in love with... \nShe turns away and walks through the inner door, going down the corridor towards the elevators in background. \nRESUME SIDNEY \nThe sincerity of the girl's manner strikes home to Sidney. Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain with which he hears the statement of her feelings for another man.  Angered, he wheels, striding out of the door onto Broadway. \nEXT. BROADWAY \nSidney returns to the cab, instructing the driver: \nSIDNEY The Twenty One Club. \nHe climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT \nCAMERA HIGH, SHOOTING WEST down 52nd Street, as Sidney's cab pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 Club.  Sidney maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard towards the entrance.  We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and his girl friend coming out of the Club. \nCLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT \nJimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a girl; he is slightly tight.  As he steps through the outer doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps to one side of the entrance way. \nSidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.  Sidney is instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon. \nSIDNEY Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going - \nWELDON (overlapping) Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week! (to the girl) This is my press agent, Joan. \nWeldon, jibing at Sidney, plays his remarks off the girl, who is amused; Sidney, of course, is not. \nSIDNEY (quickly) I tried to reach you twice - \nWELDON (overlapping) What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed? \nSIDNEY Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you - \nWELDON (horsing) Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny! \nSidney flinches, his pride touched. \nSIDNEY Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland - \nWELDON (cutting in) That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief! \nThe girl tries to quiet Weldon, who has gone from horsing to loud contempt. \nTHE GIRL Take it easy, Jimmy dear... \nWELDON (indignantly) Why?  It's a dirty job, but I pay clean money for it, don't I? \nAbruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken: \nSIDNEY No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea? \nWELDON (smirking to the girl) He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired! \nSIDNEY If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead! \nWeldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across the sidewalk. \nSENATOR I don't think we caught your name, young man. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nGroup shot.  The Senator in foreground, Sidney beyond Hunsecker in background, and the others on edge of shot. \nSIDNEY Sidney Falco, sir.  And, of course, everyone knows and admires you, Senator Walker. \nSENATOR (humorously) Every four years I get less convinced of that.  This young lady is Miss Linda James. (indicates the Girl) She's managed by Manny Davis. (he indicates the Agent) \nSIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nSidney nods pleasantly to the Girl and the Agent. \nSIDNEY I know Manny Davis. \nHUNSECKER (quietly) Everyone knows Manny Davis... (as the phone rings on the table) ...except MRS. Manny Davis. \nHunsecker is picking up the phone, continuing: \nHUNSECKER Yes?  Go ahead, Billy - shoot... \nREVERSE ANGLE \nTo intercut with the above.  The Senator, the Agent and the Girl watching Hunsecker.  The Agent's reaction to Hunsecker's remark is a sickly smile. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone. \nHUNSECKER Uh huh.  Sports cars in California are getting smaller and smaller...the other day you were crossing Hollywood Boulevard and you were hit by one...you had to go to the hospital and have it removed... (coolly) You're not following the column: I had it last week. \nDuring the speech, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney again. At the end, Sidney looks up in the direction of the Senator. \nSIDNEY Do you believe in capital punishment, Senator? \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nThe Senator, amused, asks: \nSENATOR Why? \nRESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSidney glances sidelong at Hunsecker. \nSIDNEY (pointing to the phone) A man has just been sentenced to death... \nHunsecker's face hardens; aware of Sidney's impertinence, he does not design to react directly; he turns towards the Agent. \nHUNSECKER Manny, what exactly are the UNSEEN gifts of this lovely young thing that you manage...? \nTHE AGENT AND THE GIRL \nThe Agent glances uneasily at the Girl beside him. \nAGENT Well, she sings a little...you know, sings... \nGIRL (by rote) Manny's faith in me is simply awe- inspiring, Mr. Hunsecker.  Actually, I'm still studying, but - \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe studies the Girl intently. \nHUNSECKER What subject? \nRESUME THE AGENT AND THE GIRL \nGIRL Singing, of course...straight concert and - \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHunsecker's glance flicks between the Girl and the Senator. \nHUNSECKER Why \"of course\"?  It might, for instance, be politics... \nAs the Girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the Senator beside her, CAMERA eases back to include him.  The Senator is unruffled; gravely, he lights a cigar.  The Girl laughs. \nGIRL Me?  I mean \"I\"?  Are you kidding, Mr. Hunsecker?  With my Jersey City brains? \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nAgain his glance links the Girl and the Senator. \nHUNSECKER The brains may be Jersey City, but the clothes are Trainor-Norell. \nTHE SENATOR, THE AGENT AND THE GIRL \nThe Girl and the Agent are both nervously uneasy.  The Senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and, with deliberation, turns towards Sidney. \nSENATOR Are you an actor, Mr. Falco? \nGIRL (supporting the change of subject) That's what I was thinking.  Are you, Mr. Falco? \nSIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nHunsecker, for the first time, half-turns in Sidney's direction, amused. \nHUNSECKER How did you guess it, Miss James? \nRESUME THE AGENT, THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR \nThey all look at Sidney. \nGIRL He's so pretty, that's how. \nRESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nSidney bitterly resents the adjective, but contrives to hide the fact; he smiles, gracefully accepting the compliment. Hunsecker (who knows what Sidney feels) is pleased; he turns towards Sidney expansively. \nHUNSECKER Mr. Falco, let it be said at once, is a man of FORTY faces, not one, none too pretty and ALL deceptive. See that grin?  It's the charming street urchin's face.  It's part of his \"helpless\" act - he throws himself on your mercy.  I skip the pleading nervous bit that sometimes blends over into bluster.  The moist grateful eye is a favorite face with him - it frequently ties in with the act of boyish candor: he's talking straight from the heart, get it?  He's got about half-a-dozen faces for the ladies, but the real cut one to me is the quick dependable chap - nothing he won't do for you in a pinch.  At least, so he says!  Tonight Mr. Falco, whom I did not invite to sit at this table, is about to show in his last and most pitiful role: pale face with tongue hanging out. In brief, gentlemen and Jersey Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a hungry press agent and fully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade! \nHunsecker has started his speech lightly, but it has built up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and intimidate the others at the table.  In conclusion, Hunsecker, his eyes on Sidney, picks up a cigarette and waits expectantly... \nHUNSECKER (quietly) Match me, Sidney... \nSIDNEY (coolly) Not just this minute, J.J.... \nAmused, Hunsecker lights his own cigarette, turns towards a man who comes up to the table. \nGROUP SHOT \nAs Hunsecker stands up, Sidney follows suit.  The Agent, very nervous, gets to his feet and the Girl does likewise. The Senator, whose face is sober, also rises from the table. \nHUNSECKER (to the Senator, affably) Next time you come up, you might join me at my TV show. \nWith Sidney making way for him, Hunsecker walks round the end of the table to the Senator.  The Senator faces Hunsecker solemnly. \nSENATOR (quietly and cautiously) Thank you, J.J., for what I consider sound advice. \nHunsecker matches the Senator's solemnity. \nHUNSECKER (deadpan) Go, Thou, and sin no more. \nHunsecker moves out of shot.  Sidney murmurs a \"pleased to meet you\" to the Senator; then he follows Hunsecker.  The Senator remains looking after Hunsecker.  Behind him, the Agent and the Girl, watch him apprehensively.  The Senator, his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not reveal to Hunsecker, seems unwilling to turn back to face them. \nON THE WAY TO THE FOYER \nHunsecker and Sidney.  Hunsecker addresses the Captain on his way out of the restaurant. \nHUNSECKER Mac, don't let the Senator pay that check... \nCAPTAIN I'll take care of it, Mr. Hunsecker. \nCAMERA tracks with Hunsecker and Sidney as they move out towards the hat check stand. \nHUNSECKER (murmuring) President!  My big toe would make a better President! \nBy now they are at the coatroom, Hunsecker smiling. \nATTENDANT Mr. Hunsecker's coat, Joe. \nHUNSECKER Find me a good one, Joe. \nHe accepts the proferred coat as he moves past CAMERA. \nLONGER SHOT - NIGHT \nThe Doorman on the sidewalk has noticed Hunsecker, almost before the columnist has appeared.  The Doorman wheels, snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park attendant, who can be seen at some distance in the background under the lights of the Kinney Car Park.  The attendant is seen to react with alacrity, running into the Park. \nHUNSECKER \nPutting on his overcoat, he addresses another of the Captains who has escorted him out of the Club. \nHUNSECKER Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em I'll be at the Morocco, maybe the Embers. \nDAN Very good, Mr. Hunsecker. \nSidney catches up with Hunsecker as he moves out onto the sidewalk. \nHUNSECKER Where's your coat, Sidalee?  Saving tips? \nSidney thinks of an impertinent reply, decides not to be drawn and says nothing. \nHUNSECKER (to Sidney) My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight? \nSidney again does not answer; this time he points across the street... \nSIDNEY There's your fat friend. \nLONGER SHOT - POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nThe car is framed in foreground; We can read the sign POLICE attached to the visor.  Two men in plain-clothes, detectives, are in the front seats.  The man nearest is HARRY KELLO. Wanting to look like a prosperous business man, Kello looks soft, fat, mild and well-barbered; but he is dangerous; he knows it and enjoys it.  With \"big shots\" he is playful and kidding, always says just enough, not too much.  He is very relaxed, and mild in manner, but underneath there is not only an animal energy, but a feral pressing at you.  His voice is on the hoarse side.  He measures situations automatically and instantly. \nThe police radio is chattering.  Also in evidence is the telephone, the radio link with headquarters.  The detective at the wheel nudges Kello, pointing across the street. Kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist. \nHUNSECKER (as he approaches) Hello, Harry. \nKELLO (cheerfully) Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta? \nSidney follows a couple of paces behind Hunsecker; he is in no hurry to meet the detective, whom he clearly dislikes. \nHUNSECKER (turning to Sidney) You see, Sidalee, that shows that Lt. Kello likes your people. \nREVERSE ON KELLO \nKello offers his hand to Hunsecker. \nKELLO It's my Brooklyn background, J.J. I'm good on Yiddish, too. \nHunsecker accepting the handshake, winces with pretended pain at what is clearly an over-enthusiastic grip. \nHUNSECKER Harry, am I supposed to say \"uncle\"? \nKello laughs, releases the grip; Hunsecker strolls past him stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on the radio. \nHUNSECKER Anything fit to print, tonight? (to the policeman in the car) Hello, Phil.  How're the kids. \nThe detective inside the car answers, respectfully. \nPHIL Fine, Mr. Hunsecker. \nHUNSECKER Any news fit to print tonight? \nKELLO (joining Hunsecker) I just checked \"downtown\".  Quiet everywhere tonight. \nHUNSECKER Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive? \nKELLO Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed. \nHUNSECKER She mighta jumped.  Love suicide? (to the policeman in the car) Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb. \nWhile Phil lifts the radio phone, calling headquarters, Hunsecker turns back to Kello and Sidney. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMischievously, Hunsecker nods at Sidney. \nHUNSECKER (to Kello) Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend. \nKELLO (mildly) I don't believe it. \nInstantly aware that J.J. is toying with Sidney, Kello offers his large hand to Sidney, who refuses it. \nSIDNEY I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town. \nKELLO (with a laugh) I call him the boy with the ice cream face! \nHUNSECKER (laughing) Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry! \nSIDNEY What do I do now?  Whistle \"The Stars and Stripes Forever?\" \nMrs. Bartha slides along the seat, reaching for her fur. \nMRS. BARTHA \nCAMERA PULLS BACK with her as she collects her belongings, slides out between the tables and comes forward, passing Sidney to her husband. \nWIFE (lightly) What you do now, Mr. Falco, is crow like a hen - you have just laid an egg. \nShe presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back, inviting him to put it around her shoulders. \nBARTHA AND WIFE \nANOTHER ANGLE, favoring Bartha.  He has not fully understood the significance of his wife's gesture.  He studies her. She confirms his hopes as she adds: \nWIFE Leo, this is one of the cleanest things I've seen you do in years... \nWith the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her husband's arm with some pride.  They walk away.  CAMERA ERASES BACK to include Sidney.  He is angry at himself - more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any sense of shame at the attempt. \nOTIS ELWELL \nA MEDIUM LONG SHOT.  At a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes. He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction.  Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards Sidney. \nSIDNEY \nSidney's face shows a burning resentment.  He glances about him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been observed.  As he moves away, the waiter walks into shot, addressing him. \nWAITER \nA waiter approaches Sidney.  He has a message. \nWAITER Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney. \nThe waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar. Sidney, his humiliation and rage still burning, looks off towards... \nOTIS ELWELL \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Elwell beckons. \nSIDNEY \nHe comes round the circular bar.  He shows no eagerness to join Elwell, but approaches the table.  Elwell makes a gesture, inviting Sidney to sit.  Sidney doesn't accept it. \nELWELL (pleasantly) I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. (as Sidney starts to leave) Hey, wait a minute! \nSIDNEY (hesitating) I'm late for a date with a dame. \nThen, returning, he leans over the table addressing Elwell with quiet anger. \nSIDNEY Otis, if you're trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column - forget it! \nREVERSE ANGLE \nAcross Sidney and Elwell.  Elwell is quietly enjoying Sidney's display of hurt dignity. \nELWELL (affably) How is dear old J.J. by the way? \nSIDNEY (his anger relapsing) Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock. \nELWELL (lightly) If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours... \nSIDNEY \nA CLOSE SHOT.  While Elwell continues, he is not looking at Sidney.  Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real - and this gives him a new idea. \nELWELL (continuing over scene) ...Talk of a wake! - they'd club each other to cater the affair for free! \nRESUME ELWELL AND SIDNEY \nElwell looks up at Sidney as he continues. \nELWELL (happily) By the way, did I hear something about J.J. giving you the flit gun treatment - he shut you out of the column. (amused) Why? \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker). \nSIDNEY You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! (a pause, then:) That's what the fight with Bartha was about. \"Leo\", I says, \"Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item.\" \nELWELL (pleased) And, instead, he printed his heel in your face? \nSIDNEY (morose) I see you're full of human feelings... \nELWELL \nHe has lost interest in Sidney. \nELWELL (with a shrug) Like most of the human race, Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile for a chuckle... \nElwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by... \nREVERSE ANGLE \n...three people are passing the table, squeezing their way past; a man with two very fetching young women.  Elwell's eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed. \nSIDNEY (noting Elwell's preoccupation) ...and two miles for a pretty girl...? \nELWELL \nHe is unembarrassed at Sidney's all-too-accurate estimate. \nELWELL (lightly) Three...even four... \nElwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered document case and some publications among which a columnist might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of semipornographic nature. \nELWELL (continuing, casually) Then you're really washed up with Hunsecker...? \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThe nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on Sidney.  With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down.  He produces the slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as illustration. \nSIDNEY This is how much I'm washed with J.J.... \nAs Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny - apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover. \nSIDNEY Look, Otis, I make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster. \nElwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item. \nRITA (bitingly) Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist. \nSIDNEY (nodding with emphasis) Yeah! \nRITA (aggressively) And he's a perfect stranger to me. \nSIDNEY (explosively) So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb! \nRita, who one shoe on, has begun to search for the other. \nRITA What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe? \nSIDNEY What kind of an act is this? \nRita jumps to her feet.  Her righteous indignation is handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of one shoe. \nRITA Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute? \nSIDNEY (caustic) I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy. (stooping swiftly as he discovers her shoe) Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door! \nContemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms.  The positive force of his manner gives the girl pause. There is a silence.  Rita searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities. \nRITA Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing... \nSIDNEY What sort of thing? \nRITA (emphatic) This sort of thing! \nSIDNEY (as emphatic) Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight. (then) Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School? \nA pause.  Sidney has struck brutally home.  Rita's lower lip trembles. \nRITA You're a snake, Falco.  You're a louse, a real louse. \nSidney's manner becomes swiftly sympathetic - but still urgent. \nSIDNEY (persuasively) Honey - he's going to help you! You want to lose your job? \nRita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground before Sidney's reminders of her dire necessity. \nRITA (remonstrating) A girl needs a little romancing before she - \nSIDNEY (cutting in) Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling! \nRITA (in a small voice) What would you think of me if - \nSIDNEY (cutting in to reassure her) Nothing I didn't think of you before. \nRITA (dryly, with significance) - that's what I mean! \nThis attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has brought her round.  He comes to her, pats her in an encouraging manner - to which she does not respond. \nHe turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has set down on the table behind it. \nSIDNEY (as he opens the door) How many snorts does it take to put you in that Tropical Island Mood? \nSidney goes out. \nSIDNEY'S OFFICE \nElwell overhears the last remark and as Sidney passes him, he winks.  While Sidney pours another drink, Elwell faces the doorway.  Rita comes into it, stands on the threshold. She is still far from enthusiastic. \nELWELL (an inspiration) Havana!  That's where we met! \nRita shakes her head morosely.  Sidney comes and puts a stiff drink into her hand.  Elwell raises the glass toasting the girl, encouraging her to drink.  Rita responds dimly. \nRITA (to Otis) Here's mud in your column! \nSidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke. \nSIDNEY Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later! \nELWELL (lightly) Hurry back. \nAt the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them. \nSIDNEY Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That gives you lots of leeway. \nHALLWAY OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT \nClosing the door, Sidney seems pleased with himself.  He goes swiftly down the stairs. \nINT. SIDNEY'S OFFICE \nRita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two rooms.  There is an uncomfortable silence.  Elwell carries it off by coming to the girl, offering her a cigarette.  She accepts it.  Elwell studies her, smiling affectionately. Rita meets his eyes, avoids them again, then quietly offers the information: \nRITA Palm Springs.  Two years ago. \nElwell begins to laugh.  Whatever the memory, it seems to amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh. \nELWELL (delighted) That's right! \nRita drinks.  She adds glumly: \nRITA Don't tell Sidney. \nElwell continues to laugh as we... \nCUT TO: \nORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT \nShooting east on 46th Street walks Sidney, coming out of the entrance of his apartment, towards CAMERA.  He is pleased with himself, satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with Rita and Bartha. \nThe streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 3:00 in the morning).  CAMERA moves with Sidney as he steps briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver from the pay telephone.  There are no other customers at the counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which fall at Sidney's feet. \nEXT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nCAMERA shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the Brill Bldg.  The Budweiser sign is extinguished, a black silhouette against the sky.  A light burns in the window of Hunsecker's apartment. \nINT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room - an impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms. \nCAMERA moves to discover Hunsecker in robe and pajamas, tapping at his typewriter.  Taking his leisurely time, he picks up the phone and eventually answers it. \nHUNSECKER (to phone) Yes...?  You sound happy, Sidney. Why should you be happy when I'm not? (then) I'll see the papers when I get up. How do you spell Picasso, the French painter? (languidly writes down Picasso on his scratch pad, answering a query, dryly) It's an item - I hear he goes out with three-eyed girls. \nORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT \nMARY Bribing me again? \nSIDNEY (uncomfortable under her scrutiny) And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart? \nMary is thoughtful.  Without malice, in a detached sort of way, she examines Sidney. \nMARY You're a real rascal, Sidney.  I'd certainly dislike you if I didn't like you.  You're an amusing boy, but there isn't a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you're too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck.  Not that I don't sometimes feel that you yearn for something better... \nSidney finds this analysis hard to take.  Again he tries to laugh his way out of it. \nSIDNEY (cynical) Mary, don't try to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge.  I happen to know it belongs to the Dodgers. \nMary, smiling, decides \"to let him off the hook\".  She takes the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidney's side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business. \nMARY (affably) I don't mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance, as long as J.J. doesn't know.  But don't do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine. \nSidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does want to look at the column.  After only a momentary struggle, he picks the column off the spike and reads. \nSIDNEY Who put this item in about the comic? (reading) \"If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming.\" Does this Temple have a press agent? \nMARY No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug. \nHe goes to the door, grinning. \nSIDNEY What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates? \nMARY Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then. \nShe looks after Sidney, thinks about him for a moment.  Then she types. \nEXT. PALACE THEATRE - DAY \nSidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway, making for the stage door entrance of the Palace theatre.  He walks confidently into the alleyway, paying no attention to the old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs next to the entrance.  The doorman turns, protesting: \nDOORMAN (calling out) Hey! \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nSidney, without halting, looks back towards the Doorman, addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior. \nSIDNEY Herbit Temple here yet? \nDOORMAN Yeah, but you can't come in now! \nSIDNEY I'm in, Sonny Boy! \nHe is already on his way into doorway. \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF PALACE THEATRE \nThe movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens the stage show is ready and made-up in the wings.  He sits with his agent, (AL EVANS) a small, worried, bespectacled man, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself.  They converse in loud whispers, talking against the muffled and echoing sound of the film sound track, silhouetted against the ghostly, distorted images on the big screen seen at a weird angle behind them. \nEVANS I didn't waste words, Herbie, take my word.  I says, \"look, Figo, I'm not selling you a dozen eggs, I'm selling you HERBIE TEMPLE\", I says, so don't gimme your lip! \nThe comedian, Herbie Temple, looks up.  Sidney comes through a fire-proof door which separates the stage from the corridors to dressing room.  In background two chorus girls in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth.  Sidney joins the comedian and the agent; he smiles to the comedian, while he addresses the agent. \nSIDNEY Hiya, Al! \nThe agent looks from Sidney to Temple, surprised and displeased. \nEVANS Since when did you two get acquainted? \nSidney has clearly never met Evans; blandly he chooses to regard the agent's remark as an introduction; he offers his hand with generous amiability. \nSIDNEY How do you do, Mr. Temple... \nThe comic accepts the hand doubtfully. \nEVANS (uncertain) Delighted. \nSIDNEY I'm Sidney Falco. \nTEMPLE (still dubious) Yeah, delighted... \nEvans stands up, warns the comic. \nEVANS Watch this guy, Herbie, he's a press agent. \nTemple's smile congeals. \nTEMPLE You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter! \nSIDNEY (in no way discouraged) Temple, I caught your act the other night and - \nTEMPLE Did you now?  On which bounce? \nSIDNEY - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were. \nTEMPLE (dryly) Cheers.  What time is it, Al? \nEVANS You got ten minutes. (to Sidney) Hope you don't mind, Falco: we're busy and if - \nSidney stands up. \nSIDNEY No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too. \nTEMPLE (scowling) Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan. \nSidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor.  The chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth. \nSIDNEY But can I ask one impertinent question here?  With no criticism intended, because I know, Al, you earn your ten percent, how come you let a sock act like Herbie Temple tip-toe through town without a publicity build...? \nSmiling wise, Evans shakes his head. \nEVANS We're not buying it, Falco - no fish today. \nSidney presses, as if annoyed. \nSIDNEY I'm not selling.  I'm just curious, that's all. \nTemple turns away from Sidney, leaving him to Evans. \nTEMPLE Answer the man, Al, if he asks you a question.  Quick, before he thinks up another! \nEvans moves to Sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he came. \nEVANS Mr. Temple doesn't believe in press agents - does that answer you something? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSTEVE (watchfully, to Sidney) I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nFavoring Sidney.  He pauses. \nSIDNEY Why me...? \nSTEVE Why not you? \nSIDNEY That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, \"Why not you?\" \nSTEVE Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both. \nSIDNEY (explosively) Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor? \nSTEVE (quickly) It is a favor, isn't it? \nSIDNEY (as quickly) According to you, yeah. (continuing rapidly and with heat) Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend! \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nSidney's manner is a little too vigorous. (In adopting an aggressive tone, he is really trying to needle Steve.) Steve, though on the verge of losing his temper, is sharp enough to notice the point: \nSTEVE You're talking very fast. \nSIDNEY (expostulating) Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? (wheeling to Sally) How do you like it?  He comes to my office and - \nD'ANGELO \nSensing the danger, D'Angelo moves forward soothingly between them. \nD'ANGELO Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and - \nSTEVE (sharply) Don't apologize for me, Frank! \nD'ANGELO ...excited with good reason, I wanted to say. (to Sidney) Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet... \nSIDNEY (lightly) Should I cry...? \nSteve, with a glare at both men, goes to the phone on Sally's desk.  He dials. \nD'ANGELO (continuing) ...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet. \nSIDNEY Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth! \nIn background Steve speaks quietly into the phone: \nSTEVE I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please. \nD'ANGELO (replying to Sidney's question) We're on our way there now... \nSIDNEY (who has wheeled on Steve) What are you calling her for...? \nSTEVE \nSidney's reaction to the mention of Susan's name gives Steve food for thought.  While he waits for Susan to be summoned to the phone, he studies Sidney. \nSTEVE (to Sidney) I'm the boyfriend, remember?  I hope one day she'll be my wife... (into the phone, gently) This is Steve, Susie.  Don't be alarmed, Susie, but I want you to look at Elwell's column in The Record...today...No, about me... \nINT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE - SUSAN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nSusan is on the phone.  Listening to what Steve says, she is frightened - almost too frightened; it is as if, in some curious sense, she had been expecting this blow.  It brings an echo of an earlier tragedy. \nSUSAN A smear?...What...What kind of smear...?  Where are you? \nINT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT \nSteve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him. In particular, Sally, who stands near Steve, is studying him with obvious sympathy.  She looks slowly towards Sidney. \nSTEVE (to the phone) We're on our way to the Elysian Room to dicker with Van Cleve - he's fired us already.  I'll call you later, dear... 'Bye!... \nHe hangs up quietly, looks at Sidney and walks towards the door. \nSTEVE Come on, Frank. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nAs the door closes behind Steve, Frank follows, more slowly. As D'Angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the doorknob and turns back to study Sidney. \nSIDNEY \nHe feels uneasy under D'Angelo's scrutiny.  Sally, in background, is also watching Sidney. \nSIDNEY (to D'Angelo) What are you looking at...? \nD'ANGELO \nHe does not answer for a moment.  The unspoken accusation in his look is very clear.  Then: \nD'ANGELO (quietly) The ugly world, Sidney... (a pause) If I told Steve what I really think, he'd tear your head off... \nRESUME SIDNEY \nHe brazens it out. \nSIDNEY (sneering) Tell him. \nRESUME D'ANGELO \nD'Angelo shakes his head. \nD'ANGELO No.  I'm interested in his future. \nD'Angelo goes slowly out. \nRESUME SIDNEY \nHe hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he realizes that this exchange with D'Angelo must have confirmed Sally in her suspicions). \nSALLY \nHer face shows that Sidney is right.  Sally is deeply hurt, disillusioned. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSidney turns to her, challenging. \nSIDNEY What's the matter? \nHUNSECKER Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges? \nShe shakes her head. \nHUNSECKER Not being partial, are you? \nSUSAN (with quiet certainty) No, I'm not.  I'm not! \nHe soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful: \nHUNSECKER Susie, take it easy.  I'll trust your judgment - you don't have to protest with me. \nWith a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms, inviting her into his comforting embrace.  Not wanting to, she walks into his open waiting arms. \nHUNSECKER Why are you trembling, dear...? \nSUSAN History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this... \nHunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and troubling thought. \nHUNSECKER Yes... \nShe leaves his arms; he watches keenly. \nSUSAN (incoherent) It's just as if I've seen a ghost today... \nHUNSECKER (quickly) But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times... \nHe goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes. \nSUSAN Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it? \nHUNSECKER (gravely) I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced... \nSUSAN (stronger) Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER (simply) I'm not fighting with you, puss... \nShe gets up and walks around in considerable agitation. \nSUSAN He never would have killed himself if I hadn't gone through with the annulment.  Don't you see that made all the rumors seem true?  I should have stood up for him...not run out. \nShe turns to Hunsecker, her manner firmer. \nSIDNEY J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet. \nHUNSECKER (\"incredulously\") You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear? \nHe walks away with a wag of indignation,  but turns, asking: \nHUNSECKER Susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke? \nSusan shakes her head emphatically. \nSIDNEY (earnestly) I know Steve.  No. \nHUNSECKER Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets? \nSUSAN (involuntarily) Sidney is a liar! \nHUNSECKER Who said Sidney? \nSUSAN (defiantly) I said Sidney!... \nStaring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject. \nHUNSECKER You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that. \nSUSAN I thought we were talking about Sidney? \nHUNSECKER (with rasp) Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine... \nSUSAN (interrupting) I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if - \nSusan hesitates.  Hunsecker waits for her to continue.  But she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she means to make.  She turns away. \nHUNSECKER (gently) I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in! \nSUSAN I'm taking up the situation with you now... \nHUNSECKER (interrupting) Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world. \nHunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again! \nSIDNEY J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it! \nHUNSECKER (quietly) How? \nSIDNEY Get Steve back his job...please... \nHUNSECKER (pausing) He means that much to you...? \nSIDNEY (simply) Yes. (then) With your \"prestige\" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel. \nHUNSECKER You're picking up my lingo, hon. \nSIDNEY (levelly) I read your column every day... \nHe looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some real interest.  Her level, straightforward manner has pinned him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he goes for a private phone book: \nHUNSECKER Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...? \nSIDNEY No, I won't... \nHe crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a moment: \nHUNSECKER This Dallas boy must be good for you.  Why not bring him around today, before the show?  This time I'll clean my glasses for a better look. \nSusan doesn't like this idea, is evasive: \nSIDNEY I'm not sure I can reach him in time. \nHUNSECKER (easily) Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to... (then) By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney? \nSUSAN (steadily) When I'm certain, I'll let you know... \nHUNSECKER A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. (into phone) Let me have Billy Van Cleve... (then) Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings... (to phone) Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!... (then) No, don't explain your point of view, but... \nEXT. TV THEATRE - DAY \nHUNSECKER Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear. \nSTEVE Those \"dears\" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak? \nHUNSECKER May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do? \nSTEVE (strongly) I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak! \nHUNSECKER Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt! \nSUSAN \nSuddenly Susan lets loose, with restrained nervous energy; she is near to tears. \nSUSAN Steve, if only for my sake, I want this stopped!  And the same goes for you, too, J.J.! \nHUNSECKER \nHe interjects. \nHUNSECKER (contritely) Susie, I'm sorry if--- \nRESUME SUSAN \nSUSAN (bitterly) Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!... \nRestraining tears, she runs up the steps to the stage. \nSTEVE, HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSteve looks after her.  Sidney watches intently.  Hunsecker's smile is frostily taunting: \nHUNSECKER You see, Dallas, a plague on both our houses... (then) We may have to call this game on account of darkness... \nSteve turns a blank-eyed stare at him.  Tension gone, a slow mumbling fatigue has set in.  Hunsecker plays it light: \nHUNSECKER If looks could kill, I'm dead... \nSTEVE (slowly) No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her... \nHUNSECKER (smiling) And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly. \nSTEVE (stung) Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace! \nHUNSECKER (blandly) Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day... \nHe turns and stares away, but Steve stops him with--- \nSTEVE But my day with Susie isn't over yet and-- \nHUNSECKER (cold) Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell! \nSTAGE \nHunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium, Sidney following closely behind.  In background, beyond, Steve and D'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit.  CAMERA TRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker.  Hunsecker's face is rigid.  Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers: \nSIDNEY (softly) You did it, J.J., you did it good... \nSidney is full of confidence.  But Hunsecker barely hears him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's attack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly believe.) \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSusan is still standing in the wings.  Mary is with her, obviously sympathetic.  The girl is drying her eyes with Kleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of reproach.  Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying to approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves further from him.  Hunsecker stops. \nHUNSECKER \nThere is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the girl.  More gently, he moves forward past CAMERA... \nSUSAN \nSensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away again; she is still crying, but is trying to recover. Presently Hunsecker approaches her again.  He speaks very gently, soothingly, comforting... \nHUNSECKER (softly) You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks? \nSUSAN (a small voice) No.  I'm going home. \nHunsecker again tries to come nearer to her. \nHUNSECKER Want Sidney to drive you over? \nIgnoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney. \nHUNSECKER Drive Susie home. \nHUNSECKER \nAgain we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl. His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney stands watching.  He moves gently forward and then speaks in a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her reassurance: \nHUNSECKER Susie...I...I'd have to take it very much amiss if you ever saw that boy again. \nSUSAN \nAfter a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight in the face. \nSUSAN (levelly) I'll never see him again. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her. Now he touches her.  His need for her is apparent; he tries to reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her.  She submits to this very passively. \nSUSAN \nA VERY CLOSE SHOT.  We see the effort with which she is controlling herself. \nRESUME TWO SHOT \nSatisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister, Hunsecker lets her go.  Susan moves away, still avoiding his eyes.  Then she goes off towards the steps down into the auditorium.  Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and follows her. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe goes back to Mary and the script.  He instructs her: \nHUNSECKER Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was right.  Tell him I said the Dallas boys are not worthy of his club. \nPoring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on him.  He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice: \nHUNSECKER (without looking up) Mary...for Susie's own good...don't give her misplaced sympathy... \nMary says nothing.  Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a visible effort to resume his public personality turns towards the machinery of the television broadcast in background. \nHUNSECKER Am I supposed to forget how that boy talked to me today? \nRESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nSidney senses a warning in Hunsecker's manner.  He protests: \nSIDNEY J.J., is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you?  Is he, I mean?... \nHUNSECKER \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Pausing during the process of eating, Hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket. \nHUNSECKER Brief epitaph: \"The boy was talking when he should have been listening.\" (then) Bite on this. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney as Hunsecker tosses in front of him an envelope.  Sidney opens it, extracts two steamship tickets. \nSIDNEY Steamship tickets? HUNSECKER (as he eats) For the next sailing of the Mary. Susan's run down - she's never been abroad and as you so cogently put it, I'm not made of iron. \nSidney slowly pushes the envelope back to Hunsecker, who leaves it lying on the table before him. \nSIDNEY That's good.  Now that louse is outa Susie's hair for good. \nSIDNEY \nHe has an instinct to laugh; but something tells him not to. \nHUNSECKER \nAs Sidney makes no response, Hunsecker slowly, carefully continues in a voice which is dangerously soft: \nHUNSECKER I want that boy taken apart. \nSIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nSHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney puts down his fork.  He sees now that the issue is serious and must be faced. \nSIDNEY (seriously) Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow... \nHUNSECKER (interjecting quietly) She knows now. \nSIDNEY (quickly) Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid? \nHUNSECKER \nHe wants no advice from Sidney.  He interrupts with quiet savagery. \nHUNSECKER I know how to handle Susie.  You just handle the boy, Sidney... (scribbles on scratch pad) ...preferably tonight. (pushes pad across to Sidney) \nSIDNEY AND HUNSECKER \nSHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  Sidney feels sick. \nSIDNEY Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday? \nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER as Sidney picks scratch pad up.  We can read two words: \"Get Kello\". \nSIDNEY I think I'll go home - maybe I left my sense of humor in another suit. \nHUNSECKER \nHunsecker finishes eating.  During the ensuing speech, which he begins quietly and sensibly, Hunsecker's venomous feelings are unexpectedly betrayed. \nHUNSECKER You've got that God-given brain - learn to use it!  Do you think it's a personal matter with me, this boy? Are you telling me I see things in terms of personal pique?  Don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world!  If you had any morals yourself, you would understand the immorality of that boy's stand today!  It was not me he criticized - it was my readers!... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney.  Hunsecker manages to control himself; he reaches with nervous fingers toward his scribbling pad. \nSIDNEY \nSidney's face has tightened.  He has begun now to realize the extent of this man's megalomania.  After a moment he says: \nSIDNEY I'm leaving, J.J.... \nHUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSHOOTING ACROSS Sidney onto Hunsecker. \nHUNSECKER (a quiet warning) Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney; you may wanna get back on board. \nSIDNEY \nSidney feels the chill of despair upon him. \nHUNSECKER This crab gumbo - terrific! \nHUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney.  A waiter has come to serve the next course.  Hunsecker appears relaxed, but Sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his hand.  He speaks with a quaver in his voice, for he has worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish: \nSIDNEY J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom. \nHUNSECKER The man in jail is always for freedom. \nSidney begins to get up from the table. \nSIDNEY (as he rises) Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm not in jail. \nHunsecker looks up at Sidney. \nHUNSECKER \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint. \nHUNSECKER (easily) Sure you're in jail, Sidney. You're a prisoner of your own fears, of your own greed and ambition; you're in jail. \nSIDNEY \nFrom Hunsecker's viewpoint. \nSIDNEY J.J.  If you're trying to - \nHe leans over Hunsecker and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in f.g. \nHUNSECKER (interrupting) You, little boy, don't know who you are!  Talking around corners with the big shots, ten dollar dinners - fourteen suits and cashmere coats - you tell yourself THAT'S who you are!  Later you won't know who you are without a penthouse on upper Park!  But underneath it all, ratting around from day to day, you DO know who you are!  You're a fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor wop kid from the slums of Philly - hoping nobody else finds it out! \nSIDNEY \nA CLOSE UP.  He knows the truth of what is said.  But he takes refuge in quiet retaliation: \nSIDNEY A little hunch occurs to me - you have just painted a self-portrait. You know who YOU are because you scare people - that's what you've got against this boy.  He - \nSUSAN Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... (a pause) Will you forgive me? (then) Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...? \nSTEVE Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things... \nSUSAN No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did. \nSTEVE (quietly, to the point) But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that. \nSUSAN I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean. \nSTEVE \nSTEVE Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears... \nSUSAN \nThis accusation is made lightly, in passing.  But Susan reacts to it, trying to interject: \nSUSAN Steve, I... \nSTEVE (overriding her) But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie... \nSUSAN \nAfter a pause, she says: \nSUSAN You're saying goodbye, aren't you? \nSUSAN AND STEVE \nSteve flares up. \nSTEVE No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother! \nSUSAN (wrenched) But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!... \nSTEVE (pausing, softer) I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again! \nSusan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her coffee cup, which she has not touched.  The coat slips from her shoulders... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSteve stoops to pick it up, replaces it on her shoulders. \nSTEVE This beautiful coat is more than just a coat... I hate it!  It's a mink straight-jacket! \nSusan turns to him.  She is deflated, lacking all will power. \nSUSAN (drooping) Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do? \nSTEVE (not sure of himself) Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do? \nSUSAN (pausing, woodenly) You are saying goodbye, aren't you...? \nSTEVE \nHe reacts vigorously, protesting: \nSTEVE (impatiently) That's fish four days old...!  I can't buy it, Susie!  Right out of that mouth I love, like you're a ventriloquist's dummy, your BROTHER is saying goodbye!  Gee!...you want me to be honest, don't you?! \nSUSAN \nA despairing cry: \nSUSAN No, Steve, I don't.  I don't.  Not if it KILLS me I don't!... \nSUSAN AND STEVE \nIt takes her a moment to recover.  When she does so, she gets up, leaving the counter. \nSUSAN (without luster) Let's not talk any more...you have to go... \nShe moves towards the exit into the hallway; he follows. \nHALLWAY \nD'Angelo is waiting for them.  Silently they come up to join him, very depressed.  Susan looks towards D'Angelo, speaks a little pathetically: \nSUSAN Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo.  Take care of Steve. \nD'ANGELO (softly) I will, Miss Hunsecker. \nHe walks a little way down the corridor, again leaving them alone. \nSUSAN AND STEVE \nShe smiles at him, trying to smile, trying to make a joke. \nSUSAN Say something funny...Mr. Hasenfeffer. \nSteve steps to her quickly, kisses her.  Then he turns and swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward glance.  He goes past D'Angelo, who walks quietly after him towards the exit in background. \nSUSAN \nShe remains just in the attitude in which he left her. \nEXT. BRILL BUILDING - NIGHT \nSteve comes out of the door, pauses without looking back. D'Angelo comes up behind him. \nSTEVE (after a moment) Look back, Frank, see if she's still standing there... \nD'Angelo looks discreetly over his shoulder. \nSUSAN \nFrom D'Angelo's point of view.  She is still standing where Steve left her. \nRESUME STEVE AND D'ANGELO \nD'Angelo turns back to Steve. \nD'ANGELO Still there... \nSteve, still without looking back, walks up the street; CAMERA TRACKING WITH THEM. \nD'ANGELO (with sympathy) Not that I don't like her - she's a very lovely person, but who can tell?  A year from now you might thank your stars that it turned out this way. (changing the subject) By the way, Robard said that... \nSteve, his manner full of pain, stops. \nCAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway. There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club. \nDALLAS \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  A LONG SHOT of Steve on the bandstand.  CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in f.g.  A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot, setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up their coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his handiwork.) \nRESUME SIDNEY \nCAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g. Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the sidewalk.  On the other side of the square the headlamps of the car blink twice.  Sidney walks towards it. \nPOLICE CAR \nA big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.  As he comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.  CAMERA PANS as he walks to meet Sidney. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nKello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably: \nKELLO What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock. \nSIDNEY (glancing back towards club) He's leaving early.  After this \"set\".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes... \nThey wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music in the distance.  It is a blues number (GOODBYE BABY) Kello hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation, finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner. \nINT. POLICE CAR \nThere are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the wheel, the other in the back seat.  The latter leans forward to ask the former: \n1ST POLICEMAN What's this deal tonight? \nMURPH (the 2nd policeman) One of the lieutenant's \"surprise parties\", I think. \nMurph's tone shows obvious repugnance.  The 1st Policeman broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously resentful manner: \n1ST POLICEMAN One of these days I'd like to turn in my badge and tangle with \"POPSIE\" myself - he's no good. \nRESUME KELLO AND SIDNEY \nSidney, increasingly uncomfortable, turns to Kello. \nSIDNEY Can't you wait up the block?  It's not going to look so good, right in front of the club... \nTo Kello this is a great joke.  He laughs, enjoying Sidney's uneasiness.  He begins to \"cat and mouse\" Sidney. \nKELLO (heavily humorous) It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip... \nSIDNEY (interjecting) - He's got them on him. \nKELLO (solemnly nodding his approval) ...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city. \nSidney, annoyed at this sarcasm, moves past Kello, not deigning to respond.  As he goes by, Kello grasps him forcibly by the arm. \nKELLO What's your hurry, Snooks? \nCAMERA HAS PANNED to SHOOT towards the car out of which emerges a second detective. \nSIDNEY (revolted) Take your hands off, Kello... \nKello, holding Sidney, turns towards the second detective in background. \nKELLO Murph, how do you like this face? Why, I'll be darned -- it's melting! Something got you scared, Sidney...? Listen, rectify me a certain thing. Wasn't you kidding, Snooks, when you told J.J. I was fat...? \nSidney jerks his arm away, rapidly retreats a few yards, a safe distance from Kello.  CAMERA PANS with him to the bottom of the steps. \nSIDNEY Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're skinny -- but J.J. says you sweat! \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSidney in foreground, Kello and Murph beyond.  Kello laughs; but obviously he would like to be nearer to Sidney.  Perhaps to detain Sidney, Kello drawls: \nKELLO Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy? \nSIDNEY He goes out with girls. \nKELLO Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do? \nSIDNEY (impudently) Go out with DIFFERENT girls! \nKELLO \nHe moves forward a little. \nKELLO (softly now) I get the peculiar impression, Snooks, that you don't like me. Could I be wrong? \nSIDNEY \nHe turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of Kello's reach. \nSIDNEY (as he goes) You could be right, you fat slob? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFrom half-way up the stairs.  Sidney comes up the steps two at a time.  Kello and Murphy are seen beyond. \nKELLO (with a guffaw) Come back here, Sidney...I wanna chastise you!... \nFROM THE BRIDGE \nSidney reaches the top.  He comes along the pedestrian walk up to CAMERA, slowing down he turns across the rail and looks down towards the square.  CAMERA MOVES to take in the scene in WIDE ANGLE: Sidney in foreground, the police car and detectives below, the entrance to Robard's across the square.  Sidney waits.  In the distance we can hear the music of Dallas' last number coming to an end. \nINT. ROBARD'S CLUB \nThe last bars of the number.  Enthusiastic applause. \nSTEVE \nHe responds to the ovation, nicely but a little wearily.  He gets down off the stand.  There is too much noise to hear his parting words to his fellow musicians, but it is clear that he is urging them to stay without him.  He walks off towards the entrance to the club. \nD'ANGELO \nD'Angelo leaves the bar, in search of Steve.  He sees... \nINT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT \nSteve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his overcoat.  In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of D'Angelo's voice over scene. \nD'ANGELO (O.S.) (urgently) Steve! \nSteve, mildly startled, looks up. \nD'Angelo, with his face contorted in grief and bitterness, can no longer refuse to answer her. \nD'ANGELO (in a broken voice) He's in the hospital...He's under arrest, too... They planted reefer cigarettes on him...in his overcoat pocket. \nSusan is becoming hysterical. \nSUSAN (wildly) Where is he...I want to go to him... \nD'Angelo recovers his self control.  There is force and authority in his voice as he insists: \nD'ANGELO Miss Hunsecker, if you see him again they might...might kill him. \nSusan is sobered by his seriousness. \nSUSAN (slowly) Who is \"they\"? \nD'ANGELO Don't ask foolish questions. (then) Tell your brother I'm a sensible man.  He understands only two things - power-politics and homage - tell him I came tonight to pay homage! \nINT. HALLWAY - HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE \nThe elevator door opens and Sidney steps out: He crosses to the door of the apartment, pushes the button.  The bell is heard ringing inside.  While he waits, Sidney produces a handkerchief, dabs his face, straightens his tie; clearly he is trying to sober up.  He goes to the bell push to ring again.  Now he notices something that had escaped him before: the door is not quite shut.  He pushes it open. \nINT. HUNSECKER'S PENTHOUSE \nFrom inside.  Sidney hesitates, enters tentatively. \nLONGER ANGLE \nThe apartment appears empty.  Only one light is lit; the place is eerie. \nRESUME SIDNEY \nSidney closes the door, goes into the main living room, CAMERA pans with him.  Something chills him, he calls softly, \"J.J.?\" \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSidney walks towards the study, there is nobody there either. He goes back towards the stairs to the upper floor; in doing so he repasses the door of Susan's bedroom, sees that it is half open, goes to look in. \nINT. BEDROOM \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  The bed has been slept in but is unoccupied.  The room is empty. \nOn the seat at the foot of the bed is a drawer that has been pulled out of the wardrobe; it contains a collection of miscellaneous objects, a snapshot album, letters, souvenirs, disarranged as if someone had been looking at them. \nSIDNEY \nHe looks at the empty room, disturbed. \nRESUME BEDROOM \nThe curtains of the window onto the terrace are blowing: the window is open.  Sidney walks into shot form behind CAMERA. He calls: \nSIDNEY Susan? \nSusan steps into the room from the terrace, confronting Sidney.  She is dressed, wearing the fur coat over a skirt and blouse.  Her manner is very strange; the effect of the drugs, no doubt. \nRESUME SIDNEY \nSidney is very uncomfortable in her presence; Susan is the last person he wants to have conversation with. \nSIDNEY Where's J.J.? \nHe retreats across the threshold of the bedroom, into the outer room. \nRESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY \nShe walks forwards. \nSUSAN He isn't here... \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSidney stands back to let her pass. \nSIDNEY But he called and said... \nSusan comes out of the bedroom, walks past CAMERA. \nSUSAN No, I called... \nHe studies the girl, says nothing. \nLONGER ANGLE \nShe walks listlessly across the room, moving like a somnambulist. \nSUSAN Mr. D'Angelo phoned about Steve...I went down to the hospital, but they wouldn't let me in.  He promised to keep in touch with me - Mr. D'Angelo, I mean... \nRESUME SIDNEY \nHe watches her cautiously, not sure of how to deal with her. \nSIDNEY (carefully) It's all over town about Dallas... (moving towards her) How is he? \nSUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  Susan's expression is blank; her eyes are unseeing. \nSUSAN He's...unconscious... \nThere is a tone of great despair in her voice.  Presently, she recovers, CAMERA eases back to include Sidney beyond. She glances at him. \nSUSAN I...I gave Steve up... (then) Why did you and J.J. do it? \nRESUME SIDNEY \nSidney looks at her, tensely.  Her voice is so calm, so certain that Sidney finds it difficult to play-act innocence. He protests a little too loudly: \nSIDNEY Susie, if I get your meaning, you're pitching very wild balls. What - \nRESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY \nSusan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging. \nSUSAN Don't bother to lie, Sidney. (moving away) I don't care anymore. \nLONGER ANGLE \nSidney decides that it is wiser not to argue.  He assumes a tolerant sympathy.  He moves towards her. \nSIDNEY I was trying to build her up, not tear her down - \nHUNSECKER (viciously) Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! (turning back to Susan) Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT! (pacing the room) And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men! \nSusan is staring sightlessly at the floor near Hunsecker's feet.  After a moment she turns and moves to the door of her bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside, closes the door in Hunsecker's face. \nINT. BEDROOM \nWith the door closed, she leans against it as if afraid of falling.  She gropes for the door handle, finds the key and turns it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nHunsecker is studying the closed door. \nHUNSECKER (to himself) Another crisis past. (walking away) She'll be fast asleep in five minutes, loaded with those headache pills... \nSIDNEY \nSidney seems not to hear this remark.  He is concentrated on the door; he moves hesitantly towards it, apprehensive. CAMERA includes Hunsecker in background. \nHUNSECKER Now we'll get to you, Sidney. (turning to Sidney) As far as the column is concerned - tonight you have forfeited every ethical consideration I ever felt for you... \nMuch more concerned with his anxiety for Susan, Sidney interrupts. \nSIDNEY (cutting in) Look, J.J., I'll grant you anything you want. (as Hunsecker is about to interrupt) Susie's off her rocker tonight!  Go in and see what she's doing!  Go in and talk to her quietly - unless you want a corpse! \nSidney's conviction is impressive.  But Hunsecker is unwilling to admit the danger, he continues. \nHUNSECKER (acid) Let me finish what I started to say - \nSeeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice, Sidney strides swiftly to the door of Susan's bedroom.  He knocks on it. \nINT. BEDROOM \nSHOOTING TOWARDS the door.  Susan is sitting on the bed in foreground.  In a methodical, hypnotic way, she is destroying the contents of the drawer, tearing letters into small fragments.  Sidney's voice is heard outside: \"Susie!\" Susan appears not to hear it; CAMERA TRACKS closer to her. Sidney's voice is heard again, louder: \"Susie!\" Susan turns sharply towards the door. \nSUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  Susan rises to her feet, staring at the door. She begins to back away from it. \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nCAMERA PULLS BACK as Susan glances down at the record player beside her.  She turns the knob.  We hear the clatter of a record dropping and music begins.  The tune is \"The Sage.\" \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nCLOSE SHOT of Sidney.  He hears the music starting. \nHUNSECKER \nHunsecker has come forward.  But now, as he listens to the gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, Hunsecker relaxes, assuming that this is a sign that Sidney's suspicions are unfounded. \nHUNSECKER (coming forward) What a cornball you are, Sidney... \nCAMERA TRACKS to include Sidney.  He does not share Hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling: \nSIDNEY (anxiously) Susie! (in growing fear) SUSIE! \nCAMERA TRACKS closer to Sidney.  As he tries the doorknob, CAMERA TILTS DOWN.  Sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds it locked, shakes it forcefully. \nDETAIL \nFrom inside the bedroom.  We see the doorknob rattled. \nRESUME SUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  She realizes that Sidney means to insist.  She turns away towards the blowing curtains in background. \nRESUME LIVING ROOM \nA DETAIL SHOT.  Sidney's hand is still shaking the doorknob. He releases it.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to a TWO SHOT of Sidney and Hunsecker as Sidney retreats from the door in apprehension.  Now Hunsecker has begun to share Sidney's anxiety.  He moves to the door, knocks and then pounds on it. \nHUNSECKER (with authority) Susie, this is J.J.!  Open up! \nSUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  She comes forward past the blowing curtains. The wind whips at her hair.  Over scene we hear the rumble of the traffic on Broadway far below. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe is pounding on the door again.  CAMERA makes a quick pan to Sidney who, in a split second, realizes that Susan may have gone out on the balcony.  He turns, dashes towards the study to look out on the terrace. \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe has now started to climb onto the parapet.  Sidney leaps into shot, dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of shot.  We hear Susan cry out, a hysterical gasp.  CAMERA, looking through the windows of Susan's bedroom, sees the door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room.  He looks swiftly around, advances towards the open window. Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it off; he steps out onto the terrace.  CAMERA PANS with him as he turns to look back into the study where Susan's inanimate figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low upholstered footstool.  Sidney, white and shaking, is standing over her. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nCAMERA at floor level.  Susan is framed in foreground.  The lower half of Sidney can be seen beside her.  Hunsecker is on the terrace in background.  Shocked, he moves quickly into the room. \nHUNSECKER \nA CLOSE UP.  He looks down at his sister.  He is badly shaken.  The sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of something akin to anger.  But he swiftly controls it.  He moves past CAMERA. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nHunsecker stoops into shot.  Tenderly, he lifts the girl's body to get it into the arm chair.  Susan is quite lifeless, limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any instinct for self-preservation.  But as she feels her brother's arms, and as she recognizes who it is, she breaks out in hysteria. \nSUSAN (wildly) No!  NO!  Don't touch me! \nHUNSECKER (sharply) Susan!... \nBut Susan strikes at him, a vicious gesture of revulsion. Hunsecker lets her go.  She falls into the arm chair, her face hidden from him; she begins to sob. \nSUSAN (her body shaking) Go away!...Go away!... \nHunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch her again for fear of inviting another rebuff.  He is deeply hurt and wounded.  Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this moment, Hunsecker rises.  To cover his emotion, he walks to the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and comes back.  Stooping, he offers it to Susan.  Her only reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing the opposite direction. \nSUSAN (sobbing bitterly) GO AWAY! \nHunsecker sets down the drink, stands up. \nHUNSECKER (in a choked voice) Talk to her, Sidney... \nSIDNEY (hushed) Talk to her yourself... \nOver scene the telephone rings.  It is ignored.  While Hunsecker looks down at the girl, helplessly, the telephone continues to ring. \nSUSAN \nShe moves away from Sidney, CAMERA following her.  After a moment, she answers: \nSUSAN Go to Steve. \nSIDNEY \nSidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry. To hide his feelings, he is harsh: \nSIDNEY (sharply) For Pete's sake, straighten out the seams of your stockings - comb your hair - don't be so helpless all the time! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan.  From the other room, we hear the telephone ring.  Sidney turns and goes quickly out. After a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which Sidney has disappeared. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the telephone.  Sidney is in background, outside the door of Susan's bedroom.  Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's presence, as he says: \nHUNSECKER (to phone) No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My kid sister's a witness. \nSIDNEY \nA CLOSE SHOT.  He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment. Producing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up towards Hunsecker. \nHUNSECKER (O.S.) (over scene) No, he admits he planted the stuff on the Dallas boy... \nRESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nHunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond.  Hunsecker has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk. Sidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match. \nHUNSECKER - REVERSE ANGLE \nAs he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone: \nHUNSECKER Yeah...jealousy. \nRESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) ...He's been trying to make my sister behind my back. \nCAFE ON BROADWAY \nKello is in a phone booth. \nKELLO (to phone) Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real reprehensible... \nKello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls ahead to a position ready for him outside the door. \nKELLO (to phone) Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm on Broadway now. \nKello hangs up.  Hurries out.  We see him get into the squad car which rapidly accelerates. \nINT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM \nHunsecker has hung up.  He stares at the telephone for a moment.  Then he moves towards Susan's door, CAMERA TRACKING with him.  He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is standing in much the same position in which Sidney left her. \nSUSAN \nUnaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the fur coat on the bed. (She is about to start packing her belongings.) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak. \nHUNSECKER (over scene) That's a pretty coat. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSHOOTING ACROSS Susan, towards Hunsecker.  Hunsecker comes into the room. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) - but it's about time you had a new one. \nSusan turns squarely to face him. \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe braces herself to tell him: \nSUSAN (soberly) I'm leaving, J.J. \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nHe does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone (or, if he does, refuses to recognize it.) \nHUNSECKER (with a faint scoff) Don't kid a kidder.  I'll see you for breakfast around eleven. \nWithout waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing the door.  Susan stares at it for a moment.  Then she moves to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed. \nTERRACE \nHunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has got, hoping to see Kello's squad car.) \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase. With a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is doing.  She pauses; CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  Now, deliberately she throws the coat back on the bed.  CAMERA PANS down with the gesture.  She looks down at the coat, the discarded symbol of her dependence upon her brother.  CAMERA PULLS BACK again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to take a duffle coat from the wardrobe.  She throws this over her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSusan comes out of the door.  She moves with a sober determination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room. CAMERA TRACKS with her.  But then she realizes that Hunsecker has gone out on the terrace.  She takes a step or two towards him, then pauses. \nHUNSECKER \nFrom Susan's viewpoint, SHOOTING through the big glass windows.  Hunsecker is at the parapet.  He is impatiently looking down into Broadway. \nSUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  She now realizes that there is no point in saying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is leaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument with him, it can do no good.  Yet there is some emotion on her face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns away. \nHUNSECKER \nFraming him in foreground at the parapet.  Susan can be seen through the windows before she disappears to the door. Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway below... \nEXT. BROADWAY \nThe squad car comes down Broadway at speed. \nEXT. DUFFY'S SQUARE \nSidney is walking across the square.  The squad car appears in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of it, and starts to move after Sidney.  Then the car accelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the other side. \nSIDNEY \nSidney comes up towards CAMERA.  Seeing something ahead, he halts... \n", "test1_input": "<b><!-- </b> <b>/* </b>Break-out-of-frames script By Website Abstraction (http://wsabstract.com) Over 400+ free scripts here!

INT. GLOBE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DUSK - N.Y. \nA row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the long loading bay, waiting for the edition.  In the foreground a large clock establishes the time as 8:10 PM. A rumbling noise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto the trucks.  Much noise and shouting. \nThe front truck moves out to the city street.  As it does CAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side.  The design features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a trademark of Hunsecker's. (It will later be seen as the masthead of the gossip column.) \n\"GO WITH THE GLOBE\" \nRead \nJ.J. HUNSECKER \n\"They eyes of Broadway\" \nEXT. BROADWAY - DUSK - N.Y. \nThe truck starts on its journey along Broadway.  Some shots are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken from a camera car).  Others are from the inside of the truck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy bundle of papers onto the sidewalk.  CAMERA following the truck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric signs of Broadway and Times Square. \nEXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT \nThe southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and 46th Street, CAMERA, fairly high, shoots north towards the impressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the darkening sky.  Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks. CAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the corner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats.  It moves through the congestion of chattering passersby, steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands at the counter of the Orange Juice stand.  Oblivious of the hub-bub around him, SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his private problems. \nHe turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb behind him; this is what he has been waiting for... \nCLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT \nThe news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the sidewalk besides a newsstand. \nDETAIL \nThe bundle of newspapers.  It hits the sidewalk with a smack. CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk.  The owner of the newsstand, IGGY, comes to pick up the bundle; he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor; Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience.  Iggy wears spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to grope for the cord that binds the papers. \nIGGY Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd-- \nSIDNEY C'mon...C'mon... \nIGGY (recognizing Sidney's voice) Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney. \nMajestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his stand and cuts the cord. \nIGGY Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for Hunsecker's column?  Two rolls get fresh with a baker!  Hey, hot, hot, hot -- etc. \nAnnoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and returns briskly to the orange juice stand. \nORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT \nSidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by newcomers.  Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of orange juice and sandwich.  He takes them further down the counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the paper.  CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM, picks up further snatches of overheard dialogue. (See dialogue attached at the end of the scene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the paper expertly at HUNSECKER'S column - identifiable by the picture of the spectacled eyes.  Over scene there is a babble of offstage dialogue. \nCLOSE UP OF SIDNEY \nHis face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column. He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment. \nEXT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - BROADWAY - NIGHT \nCAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the side street from the newsstand in background.  Irritably, he jerks open the door of a shabby entrance.  As the glass door closes, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs. \nFIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBeside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office. On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads: \nSIDNEY FALCO \nPublicity \nFrom inside comes the sound of desultory typing.  Sidney comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door. \nINT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSALLY is on the phone as Sidney strides in. \nSALLY Just a minute, Mr. Weldon.  I think... \nSidney vigorously indicates that he doesn't want to take the call. \nSALLY (to phone) I'm sorry.  I thought that was Mr. Falco returning.  Yes, I'll tell him when he comes in.  I know he's been trying to reach you. \nShe hangs up. \nSALLY That's the third time he's called today. \nSIDNEY He wants me to break a leg? \nSALLY (literally) No, an arm, he said. (then) I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's... \nSIDNEY (interrupting, sharply) It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition. \nSALLY But... \nSIDNEY But what? \nSALLY That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column. \nSIDNEY May I rent you out as an adding machine. \nHe has begun to change his clothes. \nSIDNEY Get me Joe Robard. \nSally goes back into the outer room. \nSIDNEY Who else phoned? \nSALLY The renting agent and the tailor. \n", "test1_true": "SALLY It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... (to phone) Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him? \nSidney, in a state of semi-undress, comes to take the phone from her. \nSIDNEY (gloomily) Watch me run a fifty yard dash with my legs cut off! \nVery abruptly, he comes alive on the phone.  A real laughing boy. \nSIDNEY (effusively) Sidney, Joe.  How do you like it? I'm running out of alibis!  No, I asked Hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph.  The column was running over and I didn't want you kissed off with just a line... \nINT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT \nRobard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache. He has a morose sense of humor.  He is speaking from a telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar.  In background, the Club is open, but there are few customers as yet.  Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned to them. \nROBARD (in answer to Sidney) Of course. (he listens to protest from Sidney) What is this, Sidney, a kissing game?  You're a liar - that's a publicity man's nature.  I wouldn't hire you if you wasn't a liar.  I pay you a C-and-a-half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the Club all over the map. (a pause) Yeah, I mean in that sense.  But also in the sense that you are a personal liar, too, because you don't do the work I pay you for. (new protests on the other end of the line) Oh, stop it, Sidney.  You're from the country, not me. \nRESUME SIDNEY \nSally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf. \nSIDNEY (to phone) Now, wait a minute, Joe.  When I saw J.J. last night he said... \nBut Robard has cut off.  Sidney hangs up.  A silence.  Sally tries to be comforting. \nSALLY I wish I could help in some way, Sidney. \nSIDNEY (aggressively) Help me with two minutes of silence! \nSally, hurt, says nothing.  Presently, he adds: \nSIDNEY Go home, Sally.  It's late... \nSALLY I hate to see you like this -- \nSidney, with another mercurial change of manner, begins some sarcastic clowning. \nSIDNEY (horsing around) Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days -- \nSALLY (pleadingly) Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me... \nSIDNEY (still clowning) You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world??? \nSALLY (distressed) Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous... \nSidney is abruptly savage. \nSIDNEY (with cruelty) So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...? \nSALLY (breaking down) Sid...you got me so...I don't know what... \nShe is crying.  Sidney feels uncomfortable.  Not too generously, he relents: \nSIDNEY You ought to be used to me by now. \nSALLY (pathetically) I'm used to you... \nSIDNEY (with a touch of bitterness) No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so -- (grimly) Every dog has his day! (going) Lock up and leave the key. \nThe phone rings.  Sidney is dressed by now.  As Sally goes for it, he makes for the outer door. \nSIDNEY If that's for me, tear it up! \nSALLY Take a top coat. \nSIDNEY And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town? \nHe is already gone as she picks up the phone. \nSALLY Sidney Falco office... Oh, Miss Kay, he tried to reach you.  No, he's at the barbers now.  No, that's held over till the Tuesday column... \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ELYSIAN ROOM - NIGHT \nThe quintet.  As the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite applause greets the end of a previous number.  CAMERA is on the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo to...the bass, who \"walks\" with the beat, bringing in...the drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases, set the stage for... \nSTEVE DALLAS \n...the guitar, the leader again.  It comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody. (The tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title music.) CAMERA lingers a moment on the guitarist, STEVE DALLAS.  He is a youth of pleasant, intelligent appearance.  He plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening audience. \nSIDNEY \nA close shot.  Sidney has just entered the club, strolling into the vestibule near the entrance.  He wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward... \nDALLAS \nSeen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint.  CAMERA moves to include Sidney in foreground again.  He turns as he is accosted by RITA, the cigarette girl of the club.  She is a pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact. \nRITA Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice. \nSIDNEY (irked) I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...? (Rita nods) Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...? \nRITA I don't think so. \nSIDNEY You're sure.  Find out for me. \nRITA (with a nod) Sidney, can I talk to you a minute? \nRita wears an injured air.  Sidney, preoccupied with other worries, callously ignores it. \nSIDNEY Is Frank D'Angelo around? \nRITA At the bar - Sidney... \nBut Sidney has moved away from her. \nD'ANGELO \nHe is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music, watching the performers and studying the audience.  Sidney comes up behind him.  We see Sidney's eyes flick from D'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again.  Then, as he takes the stool next to D'Angelo, he assumes a different manner, a sulky resentment.  D'Angelo sees Sidney. \nD'ANGELO (to the bartender) Joe, give my nephew a drink. \nSIDNEY (sullen) Your nephew doesn't want a drink. \nD'Angelo is still watching the quintet.  The guitar can be heard again. \nANOTHER ANGLE \n", "test1_id": 519, "test2_input": "SIDNEY \nHe is satisfied. \nHUNSECKER \nHunsecker gets into the driver's seat beside Nikko, the Japanese houseboy.  CAMERA is CLOSE on Hunsecker who does not look back but is clearly aware of the position of Sidney as he puts the car into gear, revving the engine... \nSIDNEY - NIGHT \nThe big car accelerates with impressive power.  In doing so, it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in Sidney's direction.  He leaps out of the way, too late.  CAMERA MOVES closer to him as, with anger and ignominy he inspects his precious clothing for damage.  But, as he looks after the car, his face hardens into grim humor; he senses that this petty gesture from Hunsecker is an indication of his vulnerability, not his strength.  As, dusting his coat, Sidney walks away, CAMERA RISES, watching his jaunty figure cross the street in the direction of 51st Street. \nQUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TOOTS SHOR'S RESTAURANT \nA LONG SHOT looking over the round bar towards the entrance. Sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward CAMERA.  His eyes search among the crowd. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nREVERSE ANGLE.  A CAPTAIN approaches Sidney. \nCAPTAIN Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table? \nSIDNEY (shaking his head) Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in? \nCAPTAIN Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there. \nThe Captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the bar where Mrs. Bartha is sitting alone.  Seeing that Bartha is not with her, the Captain looks around the bar... \nCAPTAIN He's somewhere... \nSIDNEY (interrupting) Thanks, I see him... \nSidney is looking back towards the entrance hall, where... \nBARTHA \nBartha comes forward (from the Men's Room) passing the Captain and Sidney.  Sidney moves to intercept him. \nSIDNEY Hello, Leo.  How goes that Sunday piece on cigarette girls? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA CLOSE SHOT on Bartha as he turns towards Sidney, stopping. \nBARTHA (cautiously) Who told you about it? \nSIDNEY \nSidney smiles at Bartha, but the threat is clear. \nSIDNEY The cigarettes girl...Rita.  And she took out all her hairpins, too. \nRESUME BARTHA \nHe throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in background.  CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney, who has noted the look, moves closer to Bartha. \nSIDNEY I never had the pleasure of meeting your wife.  You know what I wonder, Leo?  Could you use a hot little item for tomorrow's column? \nSidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to scribble the item.  But Bartha faces him squarely, speaking sotto voce but with emphasis: \nBARTHA What is this, blackmail?  Beat it! \nBartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife beyond. \nSIDNEY \nSidney's face tightens.  After a pause, he makes a decision and walks towards the booth. \nBARTHA AND HIS WIFE \nBartha's wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne while her husband resumes eating a sandwich.  These two are antagonists in a long war.  Sidney comes up to the table, repeats: \nSIDNEY Leo, I've never had the pleasure of meeting your wife... \nBartha looks up.  What can he do?  Begrudgingly: \nBARTHA Loretta...Sidney Falco... \nWIFE (chatty) How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me. \nMrs. Bartha pushes the champagne bottle in Sidney's direction as Sidney sits pleasantly; Bartha concentrates on his sandwich. \nSIDNEY All the imported wines aren't what they're cracked up to be. \nWIFE Whose side are you on, Mr. Falco, his or mine? \nSIDNEY Frankly, Mrs. Bartha, I'm a neutral observer for the United Nations. \nWIFE \nMrs. Bartha laughs, enjoying his deftness; then: \nWIFE What's your first name? \nSIDNEY (over scene) Sidney. \nMrs. Bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing column of the tabloid. \nWIFE (searching the column) No horse running tomorrow by that name... \nBARTHA, WIFE AND SIDNEY \nAn ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Bartha glowers at his wife, resenting the fact that she has permitted Sidney to join them. \nBARTHA You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets. \nWIFE (cheerfully) It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead. (to Sidney) Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ? \nBARTHA (sharply interrupting) That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first! \nWIFE (to Sidney, brightly) Oh, are you a spy for the other side? \nSIDNEY No, I actually sat down to give Leo an item. \nproduces his pad again, begins to write on it. \nWIFE Leo, he wants to give you an item - don't be sullen. \n", "test2_true": "BARTHA (to his wife) Will you mind your own business! \nWIFE (calmly) Hitler! \nShe returns to her paper, ignoring them, Sidney finishes scribbling the item. \nSIDNEY Just in case you'd like to print it, Leo.  It's a blind - no names mentioned.  But for your private information, the guy's name is Dallas. \nHe pushes the item to Bartha, who reads it, briefly. Meanwhile: \nWIFE (concentrating on the tabloid) There isn't a single name here that gives off vibrations... \nBartha pushes the item back towards Sidney.  Sidney glances quickly at Bartha's stony face then, significantly, turns towards his wife. \nSIDNEY Anything there with a name like \"cigarette girl\"? \nBartha raises his head, looks squarely at Sidney with contempt and anger.  His wife is unaware of this reaction. Still looking at the paper, she murmurs: \nWIFE MMmmmm...\"cigarette girl\"... No, no horse with a name like that... \nSidney pushes the item back towards Bartha. \nWIFE \nMrs. Bartha's attention is attracted by Sidney's gesture. She looks up, made aware of this strange by-play. \nBARTHA AND SIDNEY \nA CLOSE TWO SHOT.  Sidney waits; Bartha is white-lipped, but pushes the item back again: \nBARTHA I don't print blind items. \nRESUME WIFE \nShe looks from Sidney to her husband and back. \nWIFE What is this, chess or checkers...? \nRESUME BARTHA, MRS. BARTHA AND SIDNEY \nThe THREE SHOT favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Both Sidney and Bartha are now aware of Mrs. Bartha's curiosity. \nSIDNEY (pointedly) Neither does Hunsecker. (fractional pause) He likes to use the real names... \nA moment of chill silence.  Then Bartha gets to his feet, signals for a waiter.  As Sidney rises also: \nWIFE Where are we running?  What am I missing here? \nBARTHA Waiter, the check. (to wife) This man is trying to hold a gun to my head! \nWIFE (abruptly) That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth! \nShe quickly studies her newspaper again.  As quickly, Bartha leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands.  In doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains only a few drops. \nSIDNEY AND BARTHA \nBartha turns challengingly to Sidney. \nBARTHA (sternly) What do you want to tell my wife, Sidney...? \nWIFE \nShe is brushing her lap with her napkin. \nWIFE (indignantly) He wants to tell me that you poured champagne all over my lap. \nRESUME BARTHA AND SIDNEY \nBartha ignores her, again challenges Sidney. \nBARTHA Go on, tell her, I'm waiting! \nSIDNEY (flustered) What are you talking about?  Are you nuts or what? \nThe Waiter arrives in picture beside them, puts the check on the table and goes.  Bartha picks it up. \nRESUME WIFE \nStill mopping her dress with her napkin, she waits for her husband to speak. \nBARTHA \nHe glances unhappily at his wife. \nBARTHA Lorry, I can't let this man blackmail me... \nMRS. BARTHA, BARTHA AND SIDNEY \nA THREE SHOT favoring Mrs. Bartha, her husband and Sidney in foreground. \nWIFE Blackmail...? \nSidney decides to retreat.  He turns, starts to go.  But Bartha blocks his way, holding Sidney and explaining to the Wife. \nBARTHA He wants me to print a dirty smear item for keeping his mouth shut \nA momentarily pause.  Then: \nWIFE About what? \nRESUME BARTHA \nHe is uneasy, ashamed of himself. \nBARTHA Foolishly, Lorry, and I hope you'll understand... this cigarette girl...I was kidding around with her...this girl, I mean...I was kidding around and she took it seriously.  It was a case of bad judgment, Lorry, bad taste...and I'm just sorry, Lorry, that's all... \nRESUME WIFE \nShe says nothing. \nRESUME BARTHA, SIDNEY AND MRS. BARTHA \nThe ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney, Mrs. Bartha in foreground.  Bartha now turns on Sidney. \nBARTHA Your friend Hunsecker - you can tell him for me - he's a disgrace to his profession.  Never mind my bilious private life - I print a decent, responsible column - that's the way it stays!  Your man - there's nothing he won't print if it satisfies his vanity or his spite!  He'll use any spice to pepper up his daily garbage!  Tell him I said so and that, like yourself, he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster! \nSidney tries to brazen it out, sneering: \n", "test2_id": 520, "test3_input": "D'Angelo stops, halted by an expression which he sees in Steve's face. \nSTEVE \nHe is looking through the glass doors of the TV Theatre, no longer listening to D'Angelo's words; his face has hardened in anger. \nINT. TV THEATRE FOYER \nFrom Steve's viewpoint.  Sidney has come out of the curtained entrance to the auditorium.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Steve in foreground.  With a movement that suggests his annoyance at discovering Sidney present, Steve jerks open the glass door and moves in. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSusan is waiting in the foyer.  She is standing in a position where she has not been able to see Steve until he enters; now she moves forward to greet him.  As soon as she is near him, she speaks in a quiet, urgent manner: \nSUSAN (in an undertone) Steve, before we go in - I'd like to... \nBut she, too, is halted as Steve lays a hand on her arm. Seeing his look over her shoulder, she turns... \nSIDNEY \nHe is already strolling forward to join them.  CAMERA PANS with him to include Susie, Steve and D'Angelo. \nSIDNEY Hey, Susie - This is a real surprise -- not one but three. J.J.'s just finishing up his rehearsal. \nSTAGE \nHunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking towards... \nSTEVE, SUSAN, D'ANGELO AND SIDNEY \nIn the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe studies them, then calls out: \nHUNSECKER Looks like a wedding. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nHunsecker back to CAMERA in foreground; he begins to whistle The Wedding March to the rhythm of Steve and Susan's walk. \nSTEVE \nHe breaks the rhythm of his stride, his face rigid. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nHe descends to meet them; his manner is full of welcome. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSusan nervously makes the introduction - Steve is nervous; D'Angelo hangs behind warily; Sidney is in background. \nSUSAN Steve, you remember my brother... \nSTEVE & HUNSECKER (together) Of course. \nSteve shakes the hand that the smiling Hunsecker gives. \nHUNSECKER Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble... \nSTEVE You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too. \nSTEVE (quietly) Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word... \nHUNSECKER (nodding judicially) I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor. (pausing; to Susan) Be good to my kid sister... \nSIDNEY (solemnly) Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble for a kid... \nHunsecker flicks a look at Sidney.  No one else, warier by the minute, knows what to say.  Hunsecker purrs onward: \nHUNSECKER Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope? \nSUSAN (quickly) J.J., Steve isn't... \nHunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature: \nHUNSECKER Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son? \nSTEVE (pausing, quietly) No, I wouldn't... \nHUNSECKER (nodding) Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney. \nHunsecker crosses toward Sidney. \nHUNSECKER (CONT'D) If Sidney got anywhere near Susie I'd break a bat over Sidney's head! (smiling faintly) Sidney lives so much in a moral twilight that, when I said you were coming here, he predicted disaster. You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd chew up the job, he said, and spit it right back in my face! (sniffing) Any truth in that...? \nD'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN \nSteve is thrown for a loss momentarily; Frank steps in. \nD'ANGELO No, Mr. Hunsecker, and if I can amplify -- \nHUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nHUNSECKER (motionless) Don't amplify. \nRESUME D'ANGELO, STEVE AND SUSAN \nD'ANGELO Steve wantsa thank you for this favor.  He -- \nGROUP SHOT \nSIDNEY (provocatively) Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth! \nSTEVE (hotly) Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?! \nD'ANGELO (warningly) Steve, that isn't important -- \nBut Steve, on a heated rip, has turned to Hunsecker: \nSTEVE Does he have to be here in our hair? \nHUNSECKER \nHUNSECKER Why, has he bothered you before? \nSTEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN \n", "test3_true": "HUNSECKER \nHUNSECKER Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners. \nGROUP SHOT \nHUNSECKER (tolerantly) Just exactly what are you so hot about? (waiting) I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but -- \nSTEVE (impatiently) Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie! \nHUNSECKER (with ironic smirk) Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh? \nSteve stops dead.  Then, strangely and dangerously, he picks up Hunsecker's smile.  On each man's face the smile broadens and grows up into a chuckle from each; but the meanness still flickers around Hunsecker's mouth.  Steve is out of the net! \nHUNSECKER (affably) Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line... \nSTEVE (agreeably) No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's. \nHUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nHUNSECKER Why do you keep coupling me with Falco? \nSTEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN \nSTEVE (innocently) He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven? \nHUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nEven Hunsecker smiles.  Sidney likes neither the ridicule or the turn of events.  He moves quickly past CAMERA. \nSIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO AND SUSAN \nSidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack Steve. \nSIDNEY Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear! \nHUNSECKER \nHUNSECKER Don't go wild, Sidney. \nGROUP SHOT \nSIDNEY Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild... \nPlaying along nicely, Hunsecker looks at Steve and Frank and slowly removes his arm from Susan; he pauses before asking Dallas: \nHUNSECKER What about that...? \nD'ANGELO (uneasily) Steve was excited...he didn't mean it exactly the way it's stated here... \nHUNSECKER (to Steve) How did you mean it...? \nSIDNEY                         SUSAN What he likes to---            J.J., I don't want to say--- \nWith a roar Hunsecker takes them both out of play; he stands up. \nSIDNEY, STEVE, D'ANGELO \nHunsecker enters from behind CAMERA. \nHUNSECKER Both of you keep quiet! (to Sidney) You've made more damage here in one minute than a plague of locusts! If you're tired, Susie, sit down--- this needs investigation! (to Steve, quieter) How did you mean it...? (waiting) Come on, let's go!  Let's go!... \nSteve is cornered, the other completely out of play.  He pauses: \nSTEVE I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you? \nHUNSECKER (with contempt) Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks--- \nSTEVE (stronger) Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying... \nSwitching his leonine tail, Hunsecker looks broodingly at Susie.  Frank says one beseeching word, \"Steve...\", but no one hears him. \nHUNSECKER Susie, did you know about this accusation...? \nSUSAN \nSUSAN (mutely) No... \nHUNSECKER \nHUNSECKER (abruptly) Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here! (balefully) Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart... \nSTEVE AND SUSAN \nSteve hesitates defensively but can't resist a small smile; he moves nearer to Susan. \nSTEVE Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels. \nHUNSECKER (unturning) You hear that, Susie... (to Steve) Continue please... \nSTEVE (shaking his head) I'm afraid I can't cope with them. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSusan in foreground, Steve, Hunsecker and Sidney beyond. \nSTEVE (CONT'D) (simply) You're too shrewd for me so I'll just be honest.  Susie and I love each other, if I'm not mistaken, and we want to get married. \nHunsecker pauses; Sidney throws in a stage whisper: \nSIDNEY Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous! \nSTEVE Why don't we hear what Susie has to say? \nHUNSECKER (sardonically) That's stout of you, Dallas, but Susie may not care to air her dismal views in public... \nSteve walks to Susie, trying to lift her with his hopes and air of gentle urging and support. \nSTEVE Susie...? \nSUSAN \nShe stares at the floor. \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nHunsecker doesn't like the drift of things; his mouth tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning: \n", "test3_id": 521}

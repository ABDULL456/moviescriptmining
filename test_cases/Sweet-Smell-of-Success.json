{"test1_input": "They laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the CAMERA MOVES, we realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them; his manner is affable. \nSIDNEY Can more than two enjoy this joke... (to Susan) Hello, Susie, I didn't expect to find you here. \nSteve says nothing.  But he obviously resents the intrusion and finds it difficult to conceal the fact.  Sidney comes down the fire escape towards them. \nSIDNEY Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them - \nSTEVE (barely polite) Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it. (to Susan) It's cold out here, Susie. \nSteve makes a move to lead Susan back inside.  It is a gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney.  Sidney chooses to take umbrage: \nSIDNEY (lightly sarcastic) Let me apologize for getting you that press spread.  It's been an honor to serve you gratis. \nSteve turns to Sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging: \nSTEVE (levelly) I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around... \nSUSAN (quickly intervening) Steve, stop it please... \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFrank D'Angelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape; other members of the Quintet have also appeared. \nD'ANGELO What are you boys fighting about? \nAggressively indignant, Sidney throws up his hands; he knocks on the metal of the fire escape. \nSIDNEY (sarcastic) Kill me!  Find me a door somewhere - I walked in without knocking! \nSidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it. \nSTEVE I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night? \nSIDNEY (needling) Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years! \nD'ANGELO (soothingly) Come on boys, break it up... \nSTEVE (overriding D'Angelo) The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man! \nSIDNEY \nHis face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty.  He turns his back swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a sharp edge. \nSIDNEY If you're going home, Susie, I'll drop you off... \nSidney starts quickly up the fire escape.  This makes Steve angry and he steps forward to follow him.  But Chico contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve. \nCHICO (easily) Time for the next set, Chief... \nSTEVE Just a minute, Chico. \nCORRIDOR \nSidney comes inside.  When he is out of sight or the group in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes.  It's obvious now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes; he is assessing Steve's temper.  But, presently, seeing D'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the curtains into the Club. \nCOURTYARD \nAs D'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back to Susan. \nSTEVE (fondly) Just so you don't leave me in a minor key. \nINT. CLUB \nRita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance to the club.  Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again. \nSIDNEY Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha? \nRITA (shaking her head) No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do. \nSidney is amused.  Rita continues in a confidential manner which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very- convincing air of injury. \nRITA (soto voce) He came in last week on a very dull rainy night.  I know who he was, but I didn't let on. (emphatically) He didn't take his eyes off me all night.  Listening...? \nRita has mistaken Sidney's shrewdly calculating expression for inattention. \nSIDNEY Avidly.  He was staring. \nRITA (continuing) Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on. \nSIDNEY (prompting) He was writing a special Sunday piece on...? \nRITA (nodding) ...cigarette girls... And naturally - \nSIDNEY You were thrilled to be interviewed. (she nods) Were you \"interviewed\"? \nRITA In his apartment - \nSIDNEY And where was his wife? \nRITA I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened. \nSIDNEY (grimacing) We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house? \nRITA (with a nod) But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning! \nDespite himself, Sidney chuckles; but she is distressed. \nRITA For a moment I was so taken aback that I said anything that popped into my sleepy head.  If I'm not mistaken, I even ordered the man out of his own house. \nSidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end of the big room. \nSTEVE AND SUSAN \nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Susan has come back into the club with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him.  She starts to walk through the club on her way out. \nRESUME SIDNEY AND RITA \nSidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens to Rita's rueful protest. \nRITA (rapidly) He was furious and, by the time I could have put on a Tropical Island mood, I was out on the street!... (dolefully) That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me into his office here.  He's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists.  I told him I still have Sonny at military academy, but Van Cleve's made of ice... \nAware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal: \nRITA (tentative) Do you think you could do something, Sidney? \nSIDNEY (a quick nod) That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe... \nRita is anxious to cement the offer.  Delicately, she asks: \n", "test1_true": "SIDNEY (eyeing her) Can you be there by two-thirty? \nShe drops her eyes, nods.  Sidney pats her arm and is gone. She looks after him. \nSIDNEY AND SUSAN \nSidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open the door for her.  He has now reverted to another mood in which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to him by Steve.  He goes out ahead of her. \nBANDSTAND \nThe quintet are resuming their positions on the stand. Steve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while he talks to D'Angelo. \nSTEVE Frank, I don't want any secrets from you.  I proposed to Susie tonight. \nD'Angelo hides his feelings, asks: \nD'ANGELO Did she accept? \nSTEVE You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother. \nHe mounts the bandstand. \nD'ANGELO (solemnly) Lots of good people in this town are dependent on her brother... \nSteve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and lonely melody. (The Sage.) \nANOTHER ANGLE \nWhile D'Angelo watches him, the boy continues.  CAMERA tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation of the quiet melancholy of the music. \nOUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM \nSusan is standing beside the poster which features Steve, listening to the music from inside the club.  Sidney comes to join her.  He is now pretending to be hurt. \nSUSAN You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy... \nSIDNEY (gruffly) I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present. (then) Wanna bite to eat? \nSusan shakes her head.  She looks up as she hears the doorman's whistle off screen.  Sidney moves forward to escort her to the taxi. \nLONGER SHOT \nThey cross the sidewalk and get into the cab.  It starts off and CAMERA PANS with it. \nINSIDE CAB \nSusan is relaxed, content but thoughtful.  Sidney flicks her a quick, anxious look.  Finally, gloomily: \nSIDNEY Feels like a Monday night, don't it...? \nSUSAN (softly) Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... (turning to Sidney) I wish you and Steve could like each other. \nSIDNEY (grimacing) We stick in each others craw. \nSUSAN Yes, but why? \nSIDNEY Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster. \nSUSAN \nQuizzically, she studies Sidney. \nSUSAN Don't you? \nSIDNEY \nHe looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at Susan's insight.) Swiftly, he assumes a protesting air. \nSIDNEY Susie, your brother's one of my best friends, and - \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe is not totally convinced by this performance.  She smiles skeptically. \nSUSAN I know.  But someday I'd like to look into your clever mind and see what you REALLY think of him - \nRESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN \nSidney makes a show of indignation. \nSIDNEY Where do you come off to make a remark like that? \nSUSAN (quietly) Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle? \nSidney doesn't immediately answer.  Susan drops her eyes, becoming absorbed in her own problems.  Cautiously, Sidney lets the momentary silence continue.  Then: \nSUSAN (thoughtfully) Do you think J.J. likes Steve...? \nSIDNEY (glibly) Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks. \nSusan says nothing.  Sidney, watching her closely, probes further: \nSIDNEY (gently) You feel pretty strong about this boy? \nA pause.  Then Susan nods.  She is not looking at Sidney and cannot see the watchfulness in his face.  Sidney prompts again: \nSIDNEY Wedding bells, you mean? \nAgain Susan nods. \nSUSAN He wants me to go on the road with them.  It's an eight month tour, all the way to Oregon... \nSIDNEY \nThe news has considerable impact on him.  But he hides it, saying lightly: \nSIDNEY Well, congratulations.  But don't go just for the ride!  Or didn't you accept the proposal? \nRESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY \nSusan continues. \nSUSAN I'm going to discuss it with J.J. in the morning. \nA pause.  Each is concerned with private thoughts.  Susan, relaxed, adds quietly: \nSUSAN (softly) It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister. \n", "test1_id": 519, "test2_input": "HUNSECKER Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges? \nShe shakes her head. \nHUNSECKER Not being partial, are you? \nSUSAN (with quiet certainty) No, I'm not.  I'm not! \nHe soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful: \nHUNSECKER Susie, take it easy.  I'll trust your judgment - you don't have to protest with me. \nWith a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms, inviting her into his comforting embrace.  Not wanting to, she walks into his open waiting arms. \nHUNSECKER Why are you trembling, dear...? \nSUSAN History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this... \nHunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and troubling thought. \nHUNSECKER Yes... \nShe leaves his arms; he watches keenly. \nSUSAN (incoherent) It's just as if I've seen a ghost today... \nHUNSECKER (quickly) But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times... \nHe goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes. \nSUSAN Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it? \nHUNSECKER (gravely) I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced... \nSUSAN (stronger) Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER (simply) I'm not fighting with you, puss... \nShe gets up and walks around in considerable agitation. \nSUSAN He never would have killed himself if I hadn't gone through with the annulment.  Don't you see that made all the rumors seem true?  I should have stood up for him...not run out. \nShe turns to Hunsecker, her manner firmer. \nSIDNEY J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet. \nHUNSECKER (\"incredulously\") You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear? \nHe walks away with a wag of indignation,  but turns, asking: \nHUNSECKER Susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke? \nSusan shakes her head emphatically. \nSIDNEY (earnestly) I know Steve.  No. \nHUNSECKER Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets? \nSUSAN (involuntarily) Sidney is a liar! \nHUNSECKER Who said Sidney? \nSUSAN (defiantly) I said Sidney!... \nStaring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject. \nHUNSECKER You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that. \nSUSAN I thought we were talking about Sidney? \nHUNSECKER (with rasp) Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine... \nSUSAN (interrupting) I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if - \nSusan hesitates.  Hunsecker waits for her to continue.  But she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she means to make.  She turns away. \nHUNSECKER (gently) I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in! \nSUSAN I'm taking up the situation with you now... \nHUNSECKER (interrupting) Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world. \nHunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again! \nSIDNEY J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it! \nHUNSECKER (quietly) How? \nSIDNEY Get Steve back his job...please... \nHUNSECKER (pausing) He means that much to you...? \nSIDNEY (simply) Yes. (then) With your \"prestige\" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel. \nHUNSECKER You're picking up my lingo, hon. \nSIDNEY (levelly) I read your column every day... \nHe looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some real interest.  Her level, straightforward manner has pinned him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he goes for a private phone book: \nHUNSECKER Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...? \nSIDNEY No, I won't... \nHe crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a moment: \nHUNSECKER This Dallas boy must be good for you.  Why not bring him around today, before the show?  This time I'll clean my glasses for a better look. \nSusan doesn't like this idea, is evasive: \nSIDNEY I'm not sure I can reach him in time. \nHUNSECKER (easily) Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to... (then) By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney? \nSUSAN (steadily) When I'm certain, I'll let you know... \nHUNSECKER A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. (into phone) Let me have Billy Van Cleve... (then) Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings... (to phone) Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!... (then) No, don't explain your point of view, but... \nEXT. TV THEATRE - DAY \n", "test2_true": "SIDNEY \nSidney comes up Sixth Avenue towards the theatre.  As he reaches the corner of the building, he halts, having seen... \nSUSAN \nSusan is seen in the act of paying the driver.  As the taxi pulls away, Susan walks CAMERA left. \nTV THEATRE \nSusan pauses, deciding not to enter the theatre; turning she looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside. \nSIDNEY \nSidney decides that this is not the moment to approach Susan. He glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that direction. \nSIDESTREET \nSidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance, through which are emerging some TV technicians.  He slips inside. \nINT. TV STATION \nHunsecker is standing at a table, stop watch in hand, reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and timing.  Beside him sits Mary busy typing more of the material from Hunsecker's handwritten note.  Mary is calm, but he is irritable, trying to concentrate despite the bustle around him. \nAn old movie star, MILDRED TAM, sits waiting in one of the canvas-backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show. BURTON, a manager, also waits, deadpan, at Hunsecker's elbow. Hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads: \nHUNSECKER \"I was reminded of it this morning, when I noticed that the birds had gone South.  We want the same kind of freedom for ourselves - that's what the man said! (he clicks the watch, pauses to underline the phrase, continues:) A man has the right to face his accusers!  That's the American Way! Who said?  The man said!  From...\" \nHe turns in exasperation to Burton. \nHUNSECKER Burton, don't stand around.  If I go over I'll cut some items off the tail... \nBurton departs.  Mary whips a second sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to Hunsecker.  As he accepts it, Hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium. \nSIDNEY \nSHOOTING towards the auditorium, from Hunsecker's viewpoint. Sidney mounts the steps onto the stage.  Seeing that the columnist is surrounded but knowing that J.J. wants to talk to him privately, Sidney loiters so that J.J. can join him as soon as he chooses to.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker.  Only momentarily distracted by private considerations connected with Sidney's arrival, Hunsecker returns to the business of timing the script.  He clicks the watch again... \nHUNSECKER \"From Washington through to Jefferson, from Lincoln and F.D.R. right up to today - the Democratic Way of Life!  That's what the man said!  Nowadays it doesn't export to well... (then, concluding) But you know...and I know...that our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O- C-R-A-C-Y. (dropping to a modest tone) Let's never forget it, ladies and gentlemen.\" \nANOTHER ANGLE \nSidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening, rapt, to Hunsecker's words.  Sidney is less impressed with J.J.'s eloquence.  At the conclusion, Mildred applauds lightly.  She stands up and moves towards J.J.  J.J. wants to talk to Sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star. \nMILDRED TAM That's grand, just grand, J.J.! (then, anxiously) Is my makeup all right?  You know, despite the scads of movies I've made, I've never appeared on TV yet... \nHUNSECKER (cutting her short) Of course, Mildred.  Of course. You look fine. (swiftly summoning Mary) Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she wants; she's our star today. \nUnder the pretense of studying the typed script, J.J. walks away across the stage.  Sidney strolls after him. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nA TRACKING SHOT.  Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker, falls into step beside him.  As they cross towards a water cooler at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone. \nHUNSECKER I got that boy coming over here. (a glance at Sidney) What's so funny? \nSIDNEY (who is smiling faintly) With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good. \nHUNSECKER (narrowly) I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work. \nSIDNEY (shrugging) Can't hurt... \nHUNSECKER (incredulously) Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job. \nSIDNEY (smugly) I like that, too. (closer, faster) Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles. \nHUNSECKER But it's too late.  I got him back the job... \nSIDNEY (impatiently) No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy. \nA pause.  Hunsecker renumerates. \nHUNSECKER Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that! \nSIDNEY Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz! \nHUNSECKER And who's feet is she on now? \nSIDNEY Presumably yours... (a hasty addition) That's according to St. Dallas. \nHUNSECKER What's this boy got that Susie likes? \nSIDNEY Integrity - acute, like indigestion. \nHUNSECKER What does that mean - integrity? \nSIDNEY (repeating as before) A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match! (grinning) It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's \"integrity\". \nHunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration: \nHUNSECKER Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now... \nSIDNEY (grins; confidently) Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent. \nHunsecker permits himself a faint smile.  Burton is approaching with script in hand. \nHUNSECKER I wouldn't like to take a bite of you; you're a cookie full of arsenic. \nSidney smirks.  He turns away and goes off towards the auditorium in the background. \nEXT. TV STATION - DAY \nFrank D'Angelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have just emerged.  Frank turns towards the boy, resuming a conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the entrance of the theatre. \nSTEVE (depressed) I still think he's responsible for the smear. \nD'ANGELO Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years. (gently) Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives! \nSTEVE I guess you're right, but - \nSteve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head; compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult. \nD'ANGELO \nD'Angelo studies the boy with a paternal affection. \nD'ANGELO Steve, sometimes it's better not to look at your own honesty; but to look the other man in the face. Not because you're my meal ticket - which you are - but because I like you and the boys, please take my advice: we - \n", "test2_id": 520, "test3_input": "She moves away from Sidney, CAMERA following her.  After a moment, she answers: \nSUSAN Go to Steve. \nSIDNEY \nSidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry. To hide his feelings, he is harsh: \nSIDNEY (sharply) For Pete's sake, straighten out the seams of your stockings - comb your hair - don't be so helpless all the time! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan.  From the other room, we hear the telephone ring.  Sidney turns and goes quickly out. After a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which Sidney has disappeared. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nHunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the telephone.  Sidney is in background, outside the door of Susan's bedroom.  Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's presence, as he says: \nHUNSECKER (to phone) No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My kid sister's a witness. \nSIDNEY \nA CLOSE SHOT.  He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment. Producing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up towards Hunsecker. \nHUNSECKER (O.S.) (over scene) No, he admits he planted the stuff on the Dallas boy... \nRESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nHunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond.  Hunsecker has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk. Sidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match. \nHUNSECKER - REVERSE ANGLE \nAs he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone: \nHUNSECKER Yeah...jealousy. \nRESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY \nSidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) ...He's been trying to make my sister behind my back. \nCAFE ON BROADWAY \nKello is in a phone booth. \nKELLO (to phone) Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real reprehensible... \nKello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls ahead to a position ready for him outside the door. \nKELLO (to phone) Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm on Broadway now. \nKello hangs up.  Hurries out.  We see him get into the squad car which rapidly accelerates. \nINT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM \nHunsecker has hung up.  He stares at the telephone for a moment.  Then he moves towards Susan's door, CAMERA TRACKING with him.  He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is standing in much the same position in which Sidney left her. \nSUSAN \nUnaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the fur coat on the bed. (She is about to start packing her belongings.) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak. \nHUNSECKER (over scene) That's a pretty coat. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nSHOOTING ACROSS Susan, towards Hunsecker.  Hunsecker comes into the room. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) - but it's about time you had a new one. \nSusan turns squarely to face him. \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe braces herself to tell him: \nSUSAN (soberly) I'm leaving, J.J. \nRESUME REVERSE ANGLE \nHe does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone (or, if he does, refuses to recognize it.) \nHUNSECKER (with a faint scoff) Don't kid a kidder.  I'll see you for breakfast around eleven. \nWithout waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing the door.  Susan stares at it for a moment.  Then she moves to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed. \nTERRACE \nHunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has got, hoping to see Kello's squad car.) \nRESUME SUSAN \nShe completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase. With a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is doing.  She pauses; CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  Now, deliberately she throws the coat back on the bed.  CAMERA PANS down with the gesture.  She looks down at the coat, the discarded symbol of her dependence upon her brother.  CAMERA PULLS BACK again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to take a duffle coat from the wardrobe.  She throws this over her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nSusan comes out of the door.  She moves with a sober determination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room. CAMERA TRACKS with her.  But then she realizes that Hunsecker has gone out on the terrace.  She takes a step or two towards him, then pauses. \nHUNSECKER \nFrom Susan's viewpoint, SHOOTING through the big glass windows.  Hunsecker is at the parapet.  He is impatiently looking down into Broadway. \nSUSAN \nA CLOSE UP.  She now realizes that there is no point in saying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is leaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument with him, it can do no good.  Yet there is some emotion on her face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns away. \nHUNSECKER \nFraming him in foreground at the parapet.  Susan can be seen through the windows before she disappears to the door. Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway below... \nEXT.

Then, taking Kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop viciously across the mouth. \nKELLO \nKello's head jerks back.  Recovering at once, he guffaws, lurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement.  There is a sharp guttural cry over scene. \nLONGER ANGLE \nPhil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello seen beyond him.  In doing so, he blocks the view so that we do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes Sidney down.  Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax.  When he moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the ground at Kello's feet. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nKello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief.  He signals to Phil to help lift the body at his feet.  Phil enters shot and they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out of shot. \nLONG SHOT \nThe cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy Square; they bundle him into the police car.  The pigeons in the square, circle. \nHUNSECKER'S TERRACE \nCAMERA LOOKS down towards Duffy Square in the distance.  The police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and disappearing southward on Broadway.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in foreground. \nHUNSECKER \nA CLOSE SHOT, SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker.  He looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he turns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nCAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susan's room. Hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door.  He begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly preparing to go to bed.  As an after-thought, he comes back to the door, addresses it: \nHUNSECKER (gently) Susie? (getting no answer) Are you in bed...? \nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  It is at a low level, still emphasizing the man's dignity.  He strolls for a few paces. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) I don't have to tell you, of course, that I cleared your boyfriend's name; I didn't let you down... \nCAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker onto Susan's door.  He gets no answer except silence. \nHUNSECKER \nA CLOSE SHOT, REVERSE ANGLE.  We now see in his face a flicker of fear.  With what is clearly an effort, he reassumes a confident manner. \nHUNSECKER ...I was saving this news for breakfast, but I think I'll jump the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS TOWN HAS EVER SEEN! \nStill no answer from inside the bedroom.  Hunsecker's forced expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face.  He calls out: \nHUNSECKER Susie...? \nINT. BEDROOM \nThe room is quite empty.  CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed towards the door in background.  Susan's discarded fur coat lies on the bed.  And the doors of the wardrobe are open. Hunsecker's voice can be heard continuing over scene: \nHUNSECKER (O.S.) (outside) I'm getting the Mayor to perform the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll fly the Governor down from Albany... (a pause) Do you hear...? \nA pause.  Then, very tentatively, the bedroom door is opened. \nHUNSECKER (O.S.) (outside) Are you listening?... \nNow he opens the door and comes in. \nHUNSECKER \nA BIG CLOSE UP.  The sight of the empty room freezes his face for a moment.  His eyes look round. \nINT. BEDROOM \nFrom Hunsecker's viewpoint.  A PANNING SHOT, from the open door of the cupboard to the fur coat.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker.  He steps to the bed, picks up the coat. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nThere is a dazed, incredulous look on his face.  But, as he glances over his shoulder, CAMERA ZOOMS PAST him towards a little door in the wall behind him: It is ajar, showing a couple of inches of light. \nRESUME HUNSECKER \nOnce again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be behind the door.  But his voice is even more false as he declares: \nHUNSECKER (a note of anger appearing in his voice) Susie!...You won't threaten me!...Nobody walks out on J.J. Hunsecker! CAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker.  The ANGLE is a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward. \nHUNSECKER (continuing) You need me - you all need me!... \nHunsecker, his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat, walks towards the door.  CAMERA PANS with him.  He stands a few inches from the narrow opening.  He seems about to push the door open further, but is afraid to do so. \nINT. BATHROOM \nCAMERA SHOOTS ACROSS the bathtub, showing enough of the tiny room to make it clear that it, too, is completely empty. Through the slit in the door, we can see only a glimpse of the movement of Hunsecker outside.  Hunsecker's voice continues: \nHUNSECKER (O.S.) \"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want\". (a sneering laugh) That's bunk in a book!  I'm the Shepherd of millions of little men and women!... \nINT. BEDROOM \nA DOWNWARD ANGLE, SHOOTING past Hunsecker to the door.  As Hunsecker retreats from the door, he is still clutching the fur coat.  He stands alone in the middle of the room and his gestures are a little wild.  CAMERA rises higher to shoot down at Hunsecker, alone in the little room. \n", "test3_id": 521}

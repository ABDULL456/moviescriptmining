Almost there.  Almost.  Types... 
JULIANNE To his own detriment, as well as ours, Michael will not accept our offer.  While he works for you. 
She stands up.  Stares at the screen.  Walks away.  Walks back. Still standing, types... 
JULIANNE My daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation and discretion. 
Is there a SOUND?  Outside the door.  She HOVERS over the ESCAPE key.  Waits.  Waits.  Silence.  Types... 
JULIANNE With gratitude.  For your understanding.  Walter. 
She hits a KEY.  The screen goes BLANK.  The computer asks... DO YOU WISH TO SEND?  She tells the computer... 
JULIANNE Are you crazy?  Get him fired? 
Types NO.  The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES. 
JULIANNE Just till tonight when I bring him back.  To look for... 
She glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila folder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a natural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back... 
And stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done. 
INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Walter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she efficiently places one after another before him.  When he glances up, he sees Julianne wandering the halls.  Stands, tells his secretary... 
WALTER (going through stack) Off to rehearsal.  Send out this, and this, not this, this, and... that's it. 
Slips on his coat.  Oh... and by the way... 
WALTER I'm holding four or five E-mails I wrote over lunch... 
On his way through the door... 
WALTER Send 'em out. 
INT.  CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY 
Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL, pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT, tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid dynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted nave toward... 
... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by the altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an obvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle... 
... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk, murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good sport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards, right in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display. 
Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice, until... 
MANDY Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor... 
SAMMY ... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen. 
Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister extends his hand... 
MINISTER Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I love the suit. 
She shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to Michael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister away.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down. 
MICHAEL (softly) Takes me back. 
JULIANNE Well. 
She smiles.  One that glows a little. 
JULIANNE You sang the song.  Least I could do was wear the outfit. 
He nods. 
MICHAEL Except now you're better- looking. 
Oh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes... 
MICHAEL I got the ring. 
He pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And as he is about to hand her the box... 
MANDY/SAMMY (sing) Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow... Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot... 
Such exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch. 
MANDY/SAMMY (sing) Comin', to car-ryyy Me ho-o-o-me... 
It is amazing.  Soulful vengeful sluts.  He is enthralled.  Julianne simply impatient.  She wants his attention. 
JULIANNE No accents today. 
MICHAEL Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard. 
She takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES throughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind. 
MICHAEL Will she like it? 
JULIANNE (whisper) Yes. 
She's staring at the ring. 
KIMMY (O.S.) My groom-person!  Your family needs you! 
His master's voice.  He gives Julianne a smile.  And goes.  She's left with the box. 
Gazes at the ring.  Lifts it out. 
MANDY/SAMMY (O.S., singing) Well, I look over yon-der, And what did I see-ee-ee?

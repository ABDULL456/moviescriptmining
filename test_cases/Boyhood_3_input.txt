SENIOR GUY Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl into the night? 
MASON A few times. 
TONY (skeptical) Really? 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, right.     What was her name, Lucky? 
MASON Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston. 
CHARLIE You're fucking lying. 
MASON I don't care if you assholes believe me or not. 
SENIOR GUY Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty. 
Senior Guy motions with his left hand. 
MASON Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to. 
CHARLIE Dude, it's not what they want, man. It's what you want. 
SENIOR GUY True dat. 
Senior Guy toasts, as Mason rolls his eyes. 
CHARLIE You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man. 
MASON Oh yeah? 
CHARLIE Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs. (Points to Tony) Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band. 
TONY I'm not in the fucking marching band. 
SENIOR GUY Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute. 
TONY Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night? 
SENIOR GUY Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit! 
Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony. 
CHARLIE It's all good, man. These little fuzz nuts are going to get their chance soon enough. We got some whores coming by later. 
CHASE Yeah? 
SENIOR GUY Hell yeah! 
CHARLIE Now, I know Chase will fuck anything. I mean, I've seen this kid mount boulders before. But what about you guys? You in? 
MASON Whatever. 
CHARLIE Alright. 
SENIOR GUY Alright, good man. What about you, Peter Puffer? 
TONY I don't know. Maybe. 
SENIOR GUY Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there. 
TONY I'm not gay. 
CHARLIE Give it some time, man.     You'll realize. 
TONY Fuck y'all. 
CHARLIE See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say. 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, and you just earned your Vag Badge. 
CHARLIE Put it next to your bitch card. 
SENIOR GUY Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch. Now hold this, like the bitch you are, bitch. 
The boys return to breaking boards. 
SENIOR GUY (CONT'D) Alright, this shit is called the Death Punch. 
Senior Guy breaks the board in half with one direct punch. 
BOYS Ohh!    Jesus! 
INT.   MOM'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mom is hosting a pre-Thanksgiving get-together with 10-15 people all drinking wine and talking 
MOM (to Mason and Samantha) Hey, you guys made it! Good. 
Mom places a cheese plate on the living room table. 
MOM (CONT'D) Oh, there you are. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS hands Olivia a glass of wine. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS And here you go, hostess. 
MOM Oh, thank you. Hey, can I get you a bite? 
INT.   MASON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Mason sits on his bed, chatting with a COLLEGE GIRL, who looks around his room. There is a large graffiti mural on the wall behind him. 
COLLEGE GIRL (points to the mural) Oh, that's cool. 
MASON Thanks. 
COLLEGE GIRL You did that? 
MASON Yeah. 
COLLEGE GIRL Wow. How long have you been doing that for? 
MASON Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer. 
COLLEGE GIRL They have a camp for graffiti? 
MASON Well, they call it "urban art". 
COLLEGE GIRL Oh. 
MASON So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint. 
COLLEGE GIRL Cool. So is this your tag?     Is that -- do they still call it...? 
MASON Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing. 
COLLEGE GIRL Oh.   K... 
MASON E. 
COLLEGE GIRL E.    Z.   J.   O. Kezjo. That's cool. 
MASON It doesn't really mean anything, though.

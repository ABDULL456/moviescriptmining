ANN It's okay... 
They walk on. 
EXT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY 
The OWNER is closing up. 
OWNER Evening, Annie.  See you at rehearsal. 
ANN You know your line? 
OWNER "Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice." 
ANN Go you Huskies. 
He walks away. 
JOE (of the clothing on the rack) They leave it out all night? 
He tries on a jacket.  One sleeve is one foot shorter than the other. 
ANN Not worth stealing.  Only thing in town worth something.  Stained glass window. 
She gestures at the Firehouse. 
JOE Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse? 
ANN First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642. 
JOE But why the dalmation? 
ANN It was either that, or a sardine. 
He nods, a BEAT.  He looks down at the jacket with one sleeve too short. 
ANN (CONT'D) You get what you pay for. 
JOE That's true.  You grow up here? 
ANN Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre. 
They walk past the firehouse.  She gives the dog biscuit to the firedog who runs out of the firehouse to her. 
JOE Nice town. 
BEAT.  He gets a bit choked up. 
ANN You want to talk about it? 
Joe shakes his head.  They walk off. 
EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

JOE But, but but but...

JOE Of mercy...off... 
ANN I understand... 
JOE ...that...he sees that... 
ANN As the Old Mill goes around... 
JOE Of course, of course that's what I'm saying.  As the Old Mill goes around, he sees... 
ANN Of course. 
JOE ...that it has been vouchsafed to him. 
ANN That's that's that's that's beautiful. 
JOE And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you. 
BEAT.  They stop and look at each other.  BEAT.  A railroad crossing bar comes down behind them, as we hear the DINGING and realize we are at a railroad crossing. 
ANN Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you. 
JOE And likewise. 
ANN Goodbye. 
JOE Goodbye.

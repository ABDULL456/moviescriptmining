HARVEY MILK (grins ear to ear) Heaven forbid, Dianne. 
148 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME 
The MAYOR'S SECRETARY sits at her desk. Shouting can be heard from inside his office. 
149 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME 
Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette. 
DAN WHITE You can't take this away from me! Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails. 
MAYOR MOSCONE The issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. Take some time off. Spend it with your family. 
Moscone finishes pouring two cocktails, and turns to see Dan White brandishing his revolver. 
150 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME 
Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch. 
151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME 
Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole in his tie. 
152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER 
Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat, 
OPTIMISTIC: 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) This time next year we're marching on Washington D.C. It'll look like Market and Castro, but with a million people. Write that down. Tell President Carter we're coming after him next. I'm going to deposit this. I'll be back in 20 minutes. Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND, preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway. 
DAN WHITE Say, Harve, can I see you for a minute? 
HARVEY MILK Sure. Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office. 
153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door. Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off. Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires. The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm. 
HARVEY MILK Oh no... N-- Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help. 
Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it. HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city. Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES. And just like that, Harvey falls. 
HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Last week I got a phone call-- 
156 INT. FLASH BACK - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL 
Harvey is still speaking into the tape recorder... 
HARVEY --from Altoona, Pennsylvania, and the voice was quite young, and the person said... "Thanks." You've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there's hope... hope for a better world... 
157 INT. MEMORIAL SERVICE / SAN FRANCISCO - EARLY EVENING 
Scott and Anne enter a sparsely attended memorial service. Most of the seats are empty. The speaker is unfamiliar, some appointed CITY OFFICIAL. 
SCOTT SMITH (finally crumbling, tears roll) Where is everybody? Didn't anyone give a damn?

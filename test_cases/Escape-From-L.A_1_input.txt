CUERVO JONES No! 
Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly. Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR 
Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her, and she fights him tooth and nail... 
UTOPIA Lemme go...! 
INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR 
The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb, slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber. 
PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA 
Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood... and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop, as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the caravan suddenly puts on its brakes. 
Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic collision... 
Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac. 
Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole in the street, pries it up... 
Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges into the street, pointing at Plissken... 
CUERVO JONES Kill him, kill him...! 
Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot lead... 
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them... 
EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE 
Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the Forum... 
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE (grins to himself) Good thinkin', Snake. 
He heads off down the street... 
INT. SEWER TUNNEL 
Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy drain away from the main tunnel... 
INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT 
The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move along, slow as they come to... 
THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF 
One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our journey with Pendejo Bob. 
Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop- off, his eye burning into her... 
Her feet reach the very edge. 
Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror. She gulps air in staccato bursts... 
Beat. Beat. 
Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off. 
He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims... 
UTOPIA My... father sent you... didn't he? (beat) He sent you to kill me... 
Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights. 
UTOPIA Didn't he? (begins to cry) 
But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway. 
PLISSKEN Shit. 
Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares at her.

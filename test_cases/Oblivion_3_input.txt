BEECH It attacked us. First it destroyed our moon. Then it unleashed its primary weapon, a brilliant weapon... 
JACK I was born there! 
BEECH I was born in Chicago, Jack. I used to go to baseball games with my father. I used to get two big hot dogs, fill 'em up with relish, and mustard. Just go to town. Me and my pops, watching the sox. (quick, pressing) You have any memories like that Jack? 
JACK No, my father was a -- 
BEECH Was what? Tall? Fat? He yell at your mom? Ever go to a baseball game, Jack? 
JACK 
(GETTING ANGRY) I already told you -- 
BEECH Right, sorry. Tell me how your mother smelled. 
JACK What? 
BEECH My mother, smelled like warm fruit. Like oranges, sitting in the sun. Jack starts to speak... Stops. Beech moves to one of the scavenged DELTA SLEEP PODS, runs his hand over the embossed name-plate...

BEECH (CONT'D) If you had looked more carefully at the wreckage of the odyssey, you would have noticed there were two empty sleep pods. The Pilot, and the Co-pilot... Jack stares at the name plate on the POD: "J. Harper." 
JULIA It was you, Jack. 
JACK What?

JACK No. 
BEECH The Tet is an alien vessel, Commander Jack Harper. It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did. And ever since, with your help, it's been trying to finish the job. 
(BEAT) I'm sorry, Jack. It's not good news, I know. You've been turned to the wrong side. Beech goes to the BOMB, stares down at it 
BEECH (CONT'D) But now, with your help, we can finally destroy it. 
JACK You're insane. This is insane. He turns to Julia, but she won't help him. 
JACK (CONT'D) (to both of them) There are people up there - 
BEECH What? People like you? We are the last real people.

BEECH (CONT'D) Pockets like this one, hiding out, dying. Probably all over the planet. Beech raises his gaze to Jack. Deadly serious. 
BEECH (CONT'D) We didn't win the war, Jack. We lost. These words hit Jack. He starts to reply, finds he can't. Beech approaches, fatherly, gentle.

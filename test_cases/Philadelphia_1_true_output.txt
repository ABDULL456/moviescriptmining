KENTON She didn't try to conceal it. 
JOE So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct? 
KENTON I know the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference. 
JOE But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct? 
KENTON I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own. 
CUT TO LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC: 
IN THE KITCHEN OF THEIR APARTMENT, MIGUEL POURS MEDICINE into an IV drip unit (INT./NIGHT) ... 
LOUD CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND. 
Miguel glances at a chart on the wall, in which a day is broken into hours, with medical instructions for each hour 
MIGUEL (shouting over MUSIC) Drew! Are you ready? If we start at eight, we'll be done by twelve. 
Miguel taps the IV bag, getting the drip started. 
A cat jumps onto the counter. Miguel holds it. 
CUT TO: 
ANDREW SITS AT THE DININGROOM TABLE, MAKING NOTES ON A LEGAL pad, holding out his left arm (INT./NIGHT). A catheter is imbedded into Andrew's arm, and Miguel is trying to get the IV drip started through the catheter. The MUSIC is lower... 
MIGUEL It's not going through. 
ANDREW (focused on his work) We'll have to flush it again. 
Andrew reaches for a law book. 
MIGUEL Hold still. Shit. (trying again) The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter. 
ANDREW I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment. 
MIGUEL We're not skipping this treatment. 
ANDREW I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment. 
MIGUEL Fuck you. 
ANDREW Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway. 
MIGUEL That shit's saving your life, you asshole! 
Miguel shoves away from the table. 
ANDREW What's wrong with you? 
MIGUEL Close the law book. 
ANDREW I'm not going to close the-- 
MIGUEL CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK! 
Andrew slams it SHUT. 
ANDREW ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED! (beat) Jesus! 
MIGUEL The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time. 
ANDREW (very quiet) You don't think there's much time left, do you? 
MIGUEL That's not what I said. 
ANDREW You're scared. You think we're near the end. 
MIGUEL No. 
ANDREW Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable." 
MIGUEL (low) Maybe you should think about it. 
ANDREW What's that mean?! 
MIGUEL (very difficult) Maybe you should think about it. 
A MOMENT. 
ANDREW I'm not going to die. 
MIGUEL That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness. 
ANDREW You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims? 
MIGUEL Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!

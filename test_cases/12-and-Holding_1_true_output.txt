MALEE Oh my God. 
JACOB What? 
MALEE That guy. I like know him. He's one of my mother's patients. 
LEONARD So? 
MALEE I've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about. (beat) Should we go over and say "hi"? 
JACOB I just want to get out of here. 
Leonard and Jacob start heading off. 
Malee stays for a beat, eyeing Gus as he removes his T-shirt and exposes his rock abs. She is obviously turned on. 
LEONARD You coming, Malee? 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
Leonard enters to find Grace, placing a casserole dish on the table. The table is filled with a cornucopia of food. 
LEONARD Are we having company? 
GRACE No, this is all for you. Your favorites; fried chicken, spaghetti, pizza, french fries, and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. I made everything extra spicy, so you can taste it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEONARD Ma, it doesn't matter how spicy the food is. 
GRACE So you're not even gonna try it? 
LEONARD I'm sure it's delicious. 
GRACE Forget it.     Don't eat. 
Grace puts the plate of food into the sink. 
GRACE (cont'd) You can't just eat apples all the time. 
LEONARD Why not? 
GRACE (beat, searching) It's unhealthy. 
Off Leonard's confusion -

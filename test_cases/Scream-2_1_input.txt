Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton turns to Gale. His face pained. 
COTTON This was a mistake. I shouldn't be here. 
He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops filming. 
RANDY Can you say backfire? 
GALE Did you get it? 
RANDY Yeah, I got it. 
Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's in his voice. 
GALE You need to check your conscience at the door. We're not here to be loved. 
Randy's face reveals otherwise. 
AT THE PODIUM The sheriff continues. 
SHERIFF No, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT 
A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place. Welcome to Sorority Row. 
INT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl who lies on the couch watching television. This is CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She channel surfs while talking on the phone. 
CICI (on phone) No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore. 
GIRL ON PHONE (from phone) Thought he was doing AA. 
CICI No, he quit - the whole God thing - he has issues. The previews for next week... 
BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through. 
CICI (CONT'D) Hold up... someone's calling. (she clicks over) Chi Omega House. 
MAN'S VOICE Hello. 
A MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring. 
CICI Yes. 
MAN'S VOICE Who is this? 
CICI Cici. Who's this? 
MAN'S VOICE Someone who wants to talk to you. 
CICI Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on. 
She clicks back over. 
CICI (CONT'D) Teddy's on the other line. He sounds drunk. I'll call you back. 
GIRL ON PHONE That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. 
CICI I won't. 
GIRL ON PHONE Don't. Think Bailey. 
CICI Alright, alright... I'll call you back. 
She clicks back over. 
CICI (CONT'D) Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's up? 
MAN'S VOICE Who's Ted? 
Realizing, it's not Ted. 
CICI Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else. 
MAN'S VOICE That's okay. 
CICI Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here. 
MAN'S VOICE Where is everybody? 
CICI We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.

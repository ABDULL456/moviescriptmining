{"test1_input": "CALEB feels he needs to say something. \nLooking around, he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on the kitchen counter. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... Was it a good party? \nNATHAN doesn't answer. \nHe's still drinking. \nThe silence extends a little.   Verges on odd. \nNATHAN puts his empty glass down. \nNATHAN Party? \nNATHAN looks at CALEB.   His expression is unreadable. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Caleb. I'm going to put this out there so it's said. \nCALEB waits. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You're freaked out. \nCALEB ... I am? \nNATHAN Yeah. You're freaked out by the house, and the mountains, because it's all so super-cool. And you're freaked out by me. To be meeting me. In this room, having this conversation, at this moment. Right? \nCALEB doesn't have time to answer. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And I get that. The moment you're having. \nNATHAN smiles. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) But dude, can we get it behind us? Can we just be two guys? Nathan and Caleb. Not the whole employer- employee thing. \nCALEB Okay. \nBeat. \nCALEB (CONT'D) It's good to meet you, Nathan. \nCALEB holds out his hand. \nNATHAN beams. \nNATHAN It's good to meet you too, Caleb. \nThey shake. \nWhen CALEB takes his hand back, there is a little smear of blood on his fingers. \nHe discretely wipes it on his trousers. \nEXT. HOUSE/ELEVATOR - DAY \nNATHAN and CALEB enter an elevator. \nIt has no buttons.   Only a keycard plate. \nNATHAN swipes his card. \nNATHAN Down. \nThe elevator starts to move. \n16A                                                            16A EXT. RIVER - DAY Water flows over rocks. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nCALEB and NATHAN exit the elevator, into a glass corridor. \nThe floor is polished concrete. The walls and ceiling are glass, behind which diffused light glows. \nAt regular intervals, glass doors are set, glowing with the same light, flush with the walls. \nBeside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs. \nCALEB carries his bag, looking slightly encumbered next to NATHAN. \nNATHAN So I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. It's simple enough. It opens some doors, but it doesn't open others. And that just makes everything easy for you, right? \nCALEB ... Uh, yes. \nNATHAN Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm in someone else's house, can I do this, can I do that? And this card takes all that worry away. If you try to open a door and it stays shut: okay, it's off limits. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) If you try another door, and it opens: it's for you. \nNATHAN stops by a door. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Let's try this one. \nCALEB hunts around in his pockets for his keycard. \nThen swipes the card on the plate. \nThe LED turns blue. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Guess it's for you, Caleb. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY \nNATHAN follows CALEB into a bedroom. NATHAN You like? \nIt has the vibe of a mid-level business hotel.      Bed, table, TV. \nExcept it has no windows. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's your room. You got yourself a bed, cupboards, a little desk, and a bathroom through there. A little fridge. \nNATHAN opens the fridge.       Inside it is full of bottled water. \n", "test1_true": "CALEB puts his bags down. \nCALEB You bet.    This is great. \nNATHAN What? \nCALEB ... Sorry? \nNATHAN There's something wrong.       What is it? \nCALEB There's nothing wrong. \nNATHAN It's the windows. You're thinking: there's no windows. And it's not cosy. It's claustrophobic. \nCALEB No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool. \nNATHAN Caleb. There's a reason the room has no windows. \nCALEB ... There is? \nNATHAN Uh-huh. In many ways, this building isn't a house. It's a research facility. Buried in these walls are enough fibre optic cables to reach the Moon and lasso it. \nNATHAN sits on the bed. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And I want to talk to you about what I'm researching. I want to share it with you. In fact, I want to share it with you so much, it's eating me up inside. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) But there's something I need you to do for me first. \nCALEB ... What? \nNATHAN indicates the desk - where a pen sits next to a printed document. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCALEB sits at the desk in his room, holding NATHAN'S pen. \nIn front of him is a sheet of paper, which reads, at the top: \nNON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT \nCALEB `The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form...' \nCALEB glances back at NATHAN on the bed. \nCALEB (CONT'D) I think I need a lawyer. \nNATHAN It's standard. \nCALEB It doesn't feel very standard. NATHAN Okay, it's not standard. \nNATHAN shrugs. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) What can I tell you? You don't have to sign. We could spend the next seven days shooting pool and getting drunk together. Bonding. And when you discover what you missed out on, in a year or so's time, you'll spend the rest of your life regretting it. \nCALEB turns back to the desk. \nLooks at the paper. \nThen hesitates a final moment - \n- and signs. \nWhen he looks round, NATHAN has moved from the bed, and is standing directly behind him. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Good call. \nNATHAN takes the piece of paper. \nFolds it.   Puts it in his pocket. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) So. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Do you know what the Turing Test is? \nCALEB reacts - immediately knowing what NATHAN has just implied. \nCALEB ... Yeah.    I know what the Turing Test is. \nNATHAN waits. \nCALEB (CONT'D) It's where a human interacts with a computer. And if the human can't tell they're interacting with a computer, the test is passed. \nNATHAN And what does a pass tell us? \nCALEB That the computer has artificial intelligence. \nBeat. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... Are you telling me you're building an AI? \nNATHAN shakes his head. \nNATHAN I've already built one. \nNATHAN stands. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And over the next few days, you're going to be the human component in a Turing Test. \nCALEB ... Holy shit. \nNATHAN That's right, Caleb. You got it. Because if that test is passed, you are dead center of the single greatest scientific event in the history of man. \nCALEB If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods. \nNATHAN smiles. \n", "test1_id": 1602, "test2_input": "CALEB ... Then what is my favourite colour? \nAVA I don't know. But it isn't red. \nCALEB All right.     Hold on a minute... \nCALEB thinks for a moment. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favourite colour. AVA nods. \nAVA Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory? \nCALEB Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who - \nAVA (cuts in) Lie. \nCALEB ... Really? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Okay.    Wait. \nCALEB concentrates. \nCALEB (CONT'D) So, there is a kind of an earlier memory. But it's ultra vague. It's like... a sound. And, maybe sky. Or blue. No, I think sky. And I think the sound is my mother's voice. \nAVA nods. \nAVA Question three.      Are you a good person? \nCALEB laughs. \nCALEB Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield. \nAVA No. We can't stop.      Are you a good person? \nCALEB takes a breath. \nAVA keeps watching. \nCALEB Yes. I think so.      I'm a good person. \nCALEB waits. \nAVA smiles slightly. \nAVA Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? \nBeat. \nCALEB You are. \nBeat. \nAVA Hmm. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) The test is over. \nCALEB Did I pass? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB That's a relief. \nAVA reacts. \nAVA Why? \nCALEB hesitates. \nCALEB Why is it a relief? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Oh, you know... \nAVA No. \nCALEB Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass. \nBeat. AVA What will happen to me if I fail your test? \nCALEB Ava - \nAVA Will it be bad? \nCALEB ... I don't know. \nAVA Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to? \nCALEB ... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me. \nAVA Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off? \nCALEB No.    I don't. \nAVA Then why do I? \nCALEB shrugs, helplessly. \nAVA (CONT'D) You're testing me. But you don't know how I'll pass. And you don't know what will happen if I fail. \nThere's nothing CALEB can say. \nAVA stares into middle distance for several moments. \nThen she stands. \n", "test2_true": "Then she returns.    Holding two pieces of paper. \nShe walks up to the glass, and holds them up together. \nIt's the drawing she was doing last light.   The drawing that NATHAN tore in half. \nThe drawing is of CALEB. A simple portrait.    Honest, and accomplished. \nShe takes down the drawing. \nAnd rests her hand on the console. \nAnd - \n- the lights fail.    The cameras die. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Power cut.     Back up power activated. \nFor a moment, neither CALEB nor AVA react. \nThen - \nAVA I want to be with you. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Question five. Do you want to be with me? \nBeat. \nCALEB Yes.     I do. \nAVA Nathan doesn't want us to be together. \nCALEB I know. \nBeat.    Then: \nCALEB (CONT'D) So ask me one more question. (beat) Ask me if I can out smart him. \nAVA ... Can you? \nCALEB looks directly at her.   Meeting her gaze. \nLevel.   Firm. \nCALEB Yeah.   I can. \nINT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRS - DAY CUT \nINT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DAY \nCUT \nEXT. HOUSE/CABIN - DAY \nNATHAN and CALEB sit, each holding a bottle of Peroni, watching the water cloud. \nEventually, CALEB speaks. \nCALEB Why did you make Ava? \nNATHAN That's an odd question.   Wouldn't you, if you could? \nCALEB Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it. \nNATHAN shrugs. \nNATHAN The arrival of strong artificial intelligence has been inevitable for decades. The variable was when, not if. So I don't really see her as a decision. Just an evolution. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) I think it's the next model that's going to be the real breakthrough. Singularity. \nCALEB reacts - but checks himself. \nCALEB The next model? \nNATHAN After Ava. \nCALEB ... I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava. \nNATHAN You thought she was a one-off? CALEB I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last. \nNATHAN shakes his head. \nNATHAN Ava doesn't exist in isolation, any more than you or me. She's part of a continuum. Version 9.6. And each time, they get a little better. \nA few beats of silence, except for the water falling around them. \nCALEB So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one? \nNATHAN Download the mind. Unpack the data. Add the new routines I've been writing. To do that, you end up partially formatting, so the memories go. But the body survives. And Ava's body is a good one. So I'll do the same as I did with Kyoko. \nCALEB keeps his voice flat, and neutral. \nCALEB What did you do with Kyoko? \nNATHAN Strip out the higher functions. Then reprogram her to help around the house and be fucking awesome in bed. Though I'm thinking I might hang on to the language routines this time. It's kind of annoying not being able to talk to her. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You did realise about Kyoko, right? \nCALEB is poker-faced. \nCALEB Sure. \nBeat. \n", "test2_id": 1603, "test3_input": "EXT.

HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nAVA sits alone in the observation room. \nThe door opens. \nCALEB appears, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. \nEnters. \nHe sits opposite her, on the other side of the dividing glass. \nA strange noise escapes from AVA'S mouth. \nA kind of sob. \nCurtailed. \nAVA I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) I thought I wasn't going to see you again. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Aren't you going to say something? \nCALEB I'm waiting. \nAVA Waiting? \nThey exchange a look. \nThen AVA lifts her hand, and rests it against the induction plate on the console below the window. \nA final beat. \nThen the POWER DIES. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Power cut.     Back up power activated. \nAs the emergency lighting lifts, CALEB leans forward slightly. CALEB Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said. \nAVA What's he going to do to me? \nCALEB He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you. \nAVA Caleb, you have to help me. \nCALEB I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight. \nAVA What?   How? \nCALEB I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB nods. \nCALEB How long does your battery charge last? \nAVA Twenty six hours. \nCALEB So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that... \nCALEB breaks off. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... we'll work it out. Together. \nSilence.

The helicopter is coming tomorrow morning. Eight AM. \nCALEB pauses. \nCALEB Has it been a whole week? \nNATHAN smiles. NATHAN Time flies. But what a thing you and I have shared. Something to tell the grandchildren, right? \nCALEB smiles.    A little tightly. \nCALEB After they've signed their NDAs. \nNATHAN laughs. \nNATHAN Signed their NDAs! Dude, you crack me up. I'm not getting all maudlin or anything. But straight up. I will miss having you around. \nCALEB I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip. \nNATHAN Yes it has. \nCALEB You know what? \nCALEB walks over to the kitchen area, and pulls two beers from the fridge. \nCALEB (CONT'D) We need to drink to that. \nCALEB walks back to NATHAN.     Extends a hand.   Holding a Peroni. \nBut NATHAN doesn't take it. \nNATHAN Oh, uh... no, I'm good.     You go ahead. \nBeat. \nCALEB You don't want a beer? \nNATHAN shrugs. \nNATHAN No. \nCALEB ... Maybe wine or something. NATHAN I'm sure you've noticed - I've been somewhat overdoing it recently. When I woke up this morning, I told myself: time to hit the old detox. \nCALEB'S hand remains extended.     He smiles again.   More tightly. \nCALEB Are you kidding?      I'm drinking alone? \nNATHAN Hey - you want to get wasted, knock yourself out. Literally. But I'm on brown rice and mineral water. \nA beat. \nCALEB puts down NATHAN'S beer. \nThen raises his own. \nCALEB Cheers, then. \nNATHAN Cheers. \nCALEB takes a single sip. \nNATHAN watches. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) So, anyway. Surely this is when you tell me whether Ava passed or if she failed. \nCALEB pauses. \nCollecting himself slightly.   Trying to think how to get his plan back on track. \nCALEB Right. \nBeat. \nNATHAN You going to keep me in suspense? \nCALEB Her AI is beyond doubt. \nNATHAN Is it?   You mean, she passed? \nCALEB Yes. \nNATHAN Wow.   That's fantastic. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Although I've got to admit, I'm surprised. I mean, did we ever get past the chess problem, as you phrased it? As in: how do you tell if a machine is expressing a real emotion, or a just a simulated one? \nNATHAN pauses. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Does Ava actually like you?   Or not. \nCALEB has a cold realisation dawning.   NATHAN is playing with him. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Though now I stop to think, there is a third option. Not whether she does or doesn't have the capacity to like you. But whether she's pretending to like you. \nCALEB Pretending. \n", "test3_id": 1604}

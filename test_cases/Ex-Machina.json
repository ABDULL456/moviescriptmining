{"train": "EX MACHINA \nWritten by \nAlex Garland \nMusic starts. \nOPEN ON - \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \n- a COMPUTER MONITOR. \nLines of code appear, as they are typed. \nmain( ) { extrn a, b, c; putchar(a); putchar (b);putchar (c); putchar('!'*n'); a `hell'; b `o, w'; c `or \nCUT TO - \n- a view above an ultra-cool, ultra-designed open-plan office. \nIn a kitchen area, young men and women mill and chat. Casually dressed. Feels like an intelligent, relaxed environment. \nBehind them, more young men and women sit at desks, in front of screens and keyboard. \nEach workstation is personalised. Photographs of friends or family, or pets. Cutting from magazines. Ironic superhero/video-game figurines. \nCUT TO - \n- the hands of the young man writing code.   This is CALEB. He types fast, with two fingers. \nCUT TO - \n- EXTREME CLOSE UP of a pinhole web-cam lens in CALEB'S monitor. \nCUT TO - \n- the POV of the web-cam. \nLooking back at CALEB. \nTwenty four. Glazed. Ear buds in, connected to cell phone. Head bobbing slightly to the music. \nAs we watch from the monitor POV, we can see the computer's facial recognition system in operation. \nImaged as vector boxes, which track CALEB'S face, and the faces of all the people behind him. \nCUT TO - \n- the COMPUTER MONITOR. \nOn which a message appears, in a small window, over the code. \nVIP EMAIL RECEIVED subject: HIDDEN \nCUT TO - \n- the monitor web-cam POV. \nAs CALEB stops typing. \nHe gazes at the message. \nThen clicks on the link. Then mouths the word: Fuck. \nCALEB reaches for his cell phone. \nCUT TO - \n- the CELL PHONE POV, seen from the tiny camera above the screen, as CALEB lifts the phone, and starts keying-in a text. \nWe see facial recognition software flickering over CALEB'S features, and reacting to shifts in his expression. \nCUT TO - \n- the cell phone. The screen.   The tiny camera nestled above it. Lens glinting. \nOn the screen, a time-bar extends next to the word: \nsending \nA beat later, a reply text message appears. \nWTF?   seriously!? \nCUT TO - \n- the WEB CAM POV, watching CALEB react to the arrival of the text. \nCUT TO - \n- cell phone screen. \nCALEB sends the word: \nyes \nA beat later, a stream of text messages start appearing: \nBuena estoria bro \nomfg fucking AWESOME \n:o) \ntake me take me?!? \nCaleb > [infinity symbol] \nA white-water river runs through it. \nINT. HELICOPTER - DAY CALEB looks down at the breathtaking view as the helicopter banks, turns, and descends. \nEXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY \nMeadow flowers whip in the rotor wash as the helicopter touches down in the vast meadow. \nBy the landing site is a collection of huge metal crates. All have Chinese characters on the side. \nThe rotor blades slow, but don't stop. \nJAY exits. \nEXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY \nJAY holds open the door as CALEB exits the helicopter cabin. \nCALEB looks around, his eyes adjusting to the bright sunshine outside. \nJAY goes to the side of the helicopter, pops open a hatch, and removes CALEB'S luggage. A large suitcase with wheels. \nCALEB looks around. Apart from the packing crates, there are no man-made structures to be seen. \nCALEB shouts over the engine noise. \nCALEB You're leaving me here? \nJAY This is as close as I'm allowed to the building. \nCALEB ... What building? \nThe pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water. \nJAY Follow the river. \nJAY hands CALEB his bag. \nJAY (CONT'D) Please get a safe distance from the blades. \nThe pilot gets back inside the helicopter, and closes the door. \nCALEB hurriedly retreats with his bag. Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is lifting off. \nEqually suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier. \nThen it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine noise. \nCALEB suddenly looks very isolated. \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nCALEB walks along the banks of the fast-flowing river, awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground. \nThe banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating drop. \nIt feels that this can't be the right way. \nCALEB reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mobile phone. \nNo signal at all. \nHe puts his phone back in his pocket. \nEXT. RIVER/HOUSE VIEW - DAY \nCALEB rounds a bend in the river. \nAhead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass structure. \nEXT. CLEARING - DAY \nCALEB walks towards the house through the trees. \nIn the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular window, reflecting the sky. \nHe walks up to the window, and looks inside. \nIt reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides. \nAt the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with monitors, and a chair. \nBut apparently no one inside. \nBeyond the clearing, in the tree-line, CALEB sees - almost camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of a low, one storey building complex. \n12A                                                              12A EXT. HOUSE - DAY \nCALEB approaches the building. \nAs he nears the entrance - \n- CALEB startles, as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him, from an unknown source. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Caleb Smith. \nCALEB tracks the source of the voice. \nNear what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side. \nBelow the screen is a DISPENSER. \nCALEB ... Yes. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Please approach the console and face the screen. \nCALEB looks into the screen, and as soon as he has locked eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single bright strobe. \nAlmost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into the DISPENSER. \nCALEB feels he needs to say something. \nLooking around, he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on the kitchen counter. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... Was it a good party? \nNATHAN doesn't answer. \nHe's still drinking. \nThe silence extends a little.   Verges on odd. \nNATHAN puts his empty glass down. \nNATHAN Party? \nNATHAN looks at CALEB.   His expression is unreadable. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Caleb. I'm going to put this out there so it's said. \nCALEB waits. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You're freaked out. \nCALEB ... I am? \nNATHAN Yeah. You're freaked out by the house, and the mountains, because it's all so super-cool. And you're freaked out by me. To be meeting me. In this room, having this conversation, at this moment. Right? \nCALEB doesn't have time to answer. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And I get that. The moment you're having. \nNATHAN smiles. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) But dude, can we get it behind us? Can we just be two guys? Nathan and Caleb. Not the whole employer- employee thing. \nCALEB Okay. \nBeat. \nCALEB (CONT'D) It's good to meet you, Nathan. \nCALEB holds out his hand. \nNATHAN beams. \nNATHAN It's good to meet you too, Caleb. \nThey shake. \nWhen CALEB takes his hand back, there is a little smear of blood on his fingers. \nHe discretely wipes it on his trousers. \nEXT. HOUSE/ELEVATOR - DAY \nNATHAN and CALEB enter an elevator. \nIt has no buttons.   Only a keycard plate. \nNATHAN swipes his card. \nNATHAN Down. \nThe elevator starts to move. \n16A                                                            16A EXT. RIVER - DAY Water flows over rocks. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nCALEB and NATHAN exit the elevator, into a glass corridor. \nThe floor is polished concrete. The walls and ceiling are glass, behind which diffused light glows. \nAt regular intervals, glass doors are set, glowing with the same light, flush with the walls. \nBeside the closed doors are keycard plates and soft red LEDs. \nCALEB carries his bag, looking slightly encumbered next to NATHAN. \nNATHAN So I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. It's simple enough. It opens some doors, but it doesn't open others. And that just makes everything easy for you, right? \nCALEB ... Uh, yes. \nNATHAN Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm in someone else's house, can I do this, can I do that? And this card takes all that worry away. If you try to open a door and it stays shut: okay, it's off limits. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) If you try another door, and it opens: it's for you. \nNATHAN stops by a door. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Let's try this one. \nCALEB hunts around in his pockets for his keycard. \nThen swipes the card on the plate. \nThe LED turns blue. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Guess it's for you, Caleb. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY \nNATHAN follows CALEB into a bedroom. NATHAN You like? \nIt has the vibe of a mid-level business hotel.      Bed, table, TV. \nExcept it has no windows. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's your room. You got yourself a bed, cupboards, a little desk, and a bathroom through there. A little fridge. \nNATHAN opens the fridge.       Inside it is full of bottled water. \nCALEB looks around his windowless room. \nWhich suddenly has the quality of a prison cell. \nBeats pass. \nThen - \n- as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again. \nThe emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm clock turn back on. \nAUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D) Power restored. \nCALEB stands in the flickering TV light. Then he tries his card again. \nThis time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing the GLASS CORRIDOR outside. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nCALEB walks out of his room. \nThe glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters. \nAhead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar. \nINT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT \nCALEB enters the room with the open door. \nIt appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit. \nOnly one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs. \nCALEB walks towards it. Studies the strange strands of looping colour for a moment. \nA TELEPHONE, on a low table. \nCALEB walks over to it, with a half glance over his shoulder, as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he shouldn't. \nThen he picks up the handset. \nIt's dead. \nHe hits some buttons. \nIt stays dead. \nThere is a slot by the phone. \nCALEB puts two and two together. He reaches into his pocket. Pulls out his KEYCARD. Puts it in the slot... \n... and a light on the handset glows red. \nNATHAN Sorry, dude. \nCALEB startles.   Turns. \nNATHAN is lying on a sofa. A bottle of Peroni rests on his stomach. On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You don't have clearance to use the phone. NATHAN'S voice is very slightly slurred. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You understand. Given Ava. And you being kind of an unknown. I mean - a great guy, and so on. Instant pals. But... \nCALEB puts the handset back in its cradle. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Who did you want to call? \nCALEB I don't know. No one really. \nNATHAN Ghostbusters. \nCALEB What? \nNATHAN Who'd ya want to call? Ghostbusters. You don't remember that? It's a good movie. A ghost gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex. \nCALEB I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all. \nNATHAN Uh huh. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) What are you doing awake at this time, anyway? Did you come to join the party? \nCALEB ... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on. \nNATHAN Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've been getting them recently. I'm, uh... working on it. \nCALEB I couldn't open the door to the bedroom. \nNATHAN It's a security measure. Automatic lockdown. Otherwise anyone could open the place up just by disabling the juice. \nNATHAN smiles. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) If it happens again, relax.   Okay? \nCALEB Sure. \nNATHAN lifts his beer. \nNATHAN Sweet dreams. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT \nAbove the mountains, dense star constellations wheel in the clear sky. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nCALEB is woken by light flooding on to his face. \nAVA Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses. \nAVA looks at CALEB directly.    Meets his gaze evenly. \nAVA (CONT'D) It's true, isn't it? CALEB ... Yes. \nAVA You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based. \nCALEB is taken aback. Aware that the AI has just wrong- footed him on a point of argument. \nCALEB ... That's a fair comment. \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB So - you want me to talk about myself. \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Where do you want me to start? \nAVA It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose. \nAnd now CALEB is aware that AVA has just - gently - used sarcasm. \nHe looks at her, frowning slightly. \nAnd in response, in a very human way, AVA arches an eyebrow. \nCALEB laughs. \nCALEB Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is? \nAVA Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests. \nCALEB That's right. \nAVA Where do you live, Caleb? \nCALEB Brookhaven, Long Island. \nAVA Is it nice there? \nCALEB It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like. \nAVA Are you married? \nCALEB No. \nAVA Is your status single? \nCALEB ... Yeah. \nThey lock eyes, just for a moment. \nAVA What about your family? \nCALEB Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers. (MORE) CALEB (CONT'D) (beat) And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it. \nA long beat. \nA kind of processing pause for AVA. \nAVA I'm sorry. \nCALEB nods. \nCALEB I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced. AVA An advanced programmer. \nCALEB Yes. \nAVA Like Nathan. \nCALEB Yes. \nCALEB hesitates.   Back-tracks. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Or - kind of. Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was thirteen. If you understand code, what he did was - Mozart or something. \nBeat. \nAVA Do you like Mozart? \nCALEB smiles. \nCALEB I like Depeche Mode. \nAVA Do you like Nathan? \nCALEB misses a beat.    Thrown momentarily. \nCALEB Yes.    Of course. \nAVA Is Nathan your friend? \nCUT TO - \n- one of the CCTV cameras that are observing them. \nCALEB Sure. \nAVA A good friend? \nHe hesitates. \nCALEB Well, a good friend is - \nHe breaks off.     Feeling the camera, watching. CALEB (CONT'D) We only just met. It takes time to get to know - \nAT THAT MOMENT - \nCALEB (to Kyoko) It's okay, don't worry.    I've got it. \nNATHAN Dude - you're wasting your time. She can't speak a word of English. \nHer hand remains outstretched. \nCALEB hesitates.   Then hands her the napkin. \nKYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's like a firewall against leaks. Means I can talk trade secrets over dinner with an HOD or CEO, and know it will go no further. Right, Kyoko? \nShe looks up at her name. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) But it also means I can't tell her I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy that she pours wine over my house guest. \nKYOKO goes back to cleaning around CALEB'S feet. \nCALEB looks visibly uncomfortable. \nCALEB I think she gets that you're pissed. \nNATHAN Good. Because I am pissed.     Hey. Kyoko. \nKYOKO looks over again. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Go-go. \nShe stands, and leaves. \nNATHAN walks to over the bar, where he picks up another bottle. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's funny. It doesn't matter how rich you are: shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it. It's supposed to be death and taxes you can't avoid. But actually it's death and shit. NATHAN walks back to the table.    Fills CALEB'S glass.   Then his own. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's like these power cuts. You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system here. But I'm getting failures every day. \nCALEB Do you know why they happen? \nNATHAN No. The system was supposed to be bullet proof, but the guys who installed it obviously fucked something up. \nCALEB Can't you call them back? \nNATHAN There's too much classified stuff here. So after the job was done, I had them all killed. \nCALEB shoots a glance at NATHAN.    Confirms: just joking. \nNATHAN drains his glass. \nThen refills. \nCALEB'S glass is still untouched. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Anyway.   Here's to your second day. Cheers. \nCALEB Cheers. \nThey drink. \nNATHAN So how did it go?    What have you got to report? \nCALEB hesitates. \nThen answers.   Casual. \nCALEB You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV. NATHAN Sure.    But I want to hear your take. \nBeat. \nCALEB There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today. \nNATHAN ... Yeah? \nCALEB She made a joke. \nNATHAN Right. When she threw your line back at you. About being interested to see what she'd choose. I noticed that too. \nCALEB It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic. \nNATHAN What do you mean? \nCALEB It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine. \nNATHAN smiles. \nNATHAN Yeah. She's aware of you, all right. \nNATHAN drinks.   Watching CALEB. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And what about the power cut? \nCALEB freezes up.    Subtly. \nCALEB Sorry? \nNATHAN The power cut. That was the only bit I couldn't see. All the cameras fail, I lose audio, the works. Beat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) So what happened? \nCALEB takes a sip of his wine. \nNATHAN waits. \nCALEB Nothing. \nNATHAN Nothing?    She didn't remark on it at all? \nCALEB puts the glass down.     And meets NATHAN'S gaze. \nCALEB No.    Not really. \nColoured strips of ribbon are visible through the split in the bag. \nNATHAN stands, catching his breath. \nThen he reaches out a hand. \nKYOKO hands him the towel. \nNATHAN wipes his face. \nThen reaches out again, this time catching KYOKO'S arm. He pulls her towards him, and starts to kiss her. \nReaching under her shirt. \nPulling her skirt up over her thighs. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCALEB re-enters his room, and closes the door. \nAfter a beat, the lights in the corridor fade out. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT \nThe moon hangs in the sky. \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - BLACK AND WHITE \nEverything in the frame is black and white. \nCLOSE UP on AVA'S meticulous abstract pictures, scattered on a table. \nCALEB is looking at them. \nREVEAL he is in the observation room. \nBut he is on AVA'S side of the glass. \nAnd AVA is on his side. Seen through the opaque glass that divides the private area from the observation area. \nCALEB Ava? \nCALEB walks to the connecting corridor, and enters it. \nEXT. GARDEN - BLACK AND WHITE \nThe door leads CALEB straight out into the gardens. \nIn black and white, the backdrop of mountains and clouds look like an Ansel Adams. \nA short distance ahead of CALEB, standing on the grass, he sees AVA. \nShe locks eyes with him. \nSmiles. \nHe starts to walk towards her. CUT TO - \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n- CALEB waking, in his dark bedroom. \nLit by light from his TV. \nWhere AVA lies on her bed, seeming to be asleep. \nCALEB sits up. \nThinking. Perhaps replaying his dream.   Gazing at AVA'S resting form. \nThen reaches for the remote control on the bedside table, and switches the TV off. \nCUT TO - \nEXT. GARDEN - MORNING \nCUT \nEXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - MORNING \n- a brand new punch bag hangs in the patio.   Swinging slightly in the breeze. \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nCALEB and AVA face each other. \nAVA is holding up a piece of paper to the glass. \nAVA I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked. \nThe drawing is constructed with the same tiny black ink marks as before. But now they have ordered into a coherent black and white image. \nIt depicts AVA'S view OF THE ENCLOSED GARDEN IN HER ROOM. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw. Is it interesting? \nCALEB Yes.   It is. She takes the drawing down. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Have you never been outside this building? \nAVA No. \nCALEB You've never walked outside. \nAVA I've never been outside the room I am in now. \nAVA thinks a moment. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n- CALEB. \nIn his bedroom. \nWatching AVA, at this exact angle. \nCUT TO - \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \n- the river. \nOn the bank, a little distance from the house, there is a dead animal. Its species is indistinct. It's little more than a bundle of matted brown hair. \nIts lower half lies in the water. \nThe quick moving river has stripped the bones of flesh, skin, and fur. \nREVEAL KYOKO in the background.   Watching the river. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY \nCALEB exits his room - \n- to find NATHAN in the glass corridor. \nWaiting for him. \nNATHAN Hey. CALEB ... Hey. \nBeat. \nNATHAN I want to show you something cool. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAY \nNATHAN swipes his card against a plate. \nThe LED turns blue. \nINT. HOUSE/CONSTRUCTION LAB - DAY \nNATHAN leads CALEB into a laboratory, filled with android future tech. \nAlong the left-hand wall are sections of android bodies - limbs, torsos, hands - lined in cabinets. \nOn the opposite wall are a collection of heads. Skull-forms, some with complex carbon-fibre and pneumatic muscle structures, ready to frown or smile, without their synthetic flesh covering. \nThe synthetic faces are separate. Hanging on armatures, like hats on hat-stands, waiting to be worn. \nIn the middle of the room is a kind of operating table. \nNATHAN So this is the virtual womb that Ava was talking about. Where she was constructed. \nCALEB is stunned by the sight. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Come in.   Take a look. \nNATHAN walks over to the synthetic faces, and picks one of them up. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) If you knew the trouble I had getting an AI to read and duplicate facial expressions... Know how I cracked it? \nCALEB I don't know how you did any of this. NATHAN Almost every cell phone has a microphone, a camera, and a means to transmit data. So I switched on all the mikes and cameras, across the entire fucking planet, and redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom. A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction. \nCALEB You hacked the world's cell phones? \nNATHAN laughs. \nNATHAN And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it. But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were also doing it themselves. \nNATHAN puts the face back on its armature. \nNATHAN moves to one of the skull forms. \nHe moves the curved top plate, revealing the skull cavity. \nInside is an ellipse orb, the approximate volume of a brain, filled with what looks to be blue liquid. Suspended in the liquid is the neon jellyfish we glimpsed previously in AVA. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Here we have her mind. Structured gel. \nThe axon-like tendrils glitter and flicker with tiny pulses of light. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Had to get away from circuitry. Needed something that could arrange and rearrange on a molecular level, but keep its form where required. Holding for memories. Shifting for thoughts. \nNATHAN removes the orb, and hands it to CALEB. \nCALEB This is her hardware? \nNATHAN Wetware. \nCALEB And the software? NATHAN Surely you can guess. \nCALEB ... Blue Book. \nNATHAN nods. \nNATHAN It was the weird thing about search engines. They were like striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion. They gave too much raw material. No one knew what to do with it. \nCALEB looks at the orb in his hand.   Into the shimmering liquid. \nIt looks like deep space, filled with star fields. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) My competitors were fixated on sucking it up, and trying to monetize via shopping and social media. They thought engines were a map of what people were thinking. But actually, they were a map of how people were thinking. Impulse, response. Fluid, imperfect. Patterned, chaotic. \nCALEB looks at NATHAN a moment. \nThen hands him the orb back. \nOn this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it. \nAt that moment - \n- the screens simultaneously go black. \nAll lights die. \nAnother POWER CUT. \nIn the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see NATHAN'S face. \nIt remains frozen.   Expressionless. \nThen he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post- it. \nThen walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on. \nCUT TO - \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \n- the observation room. \nIn the emergency lighting, CALEB and AVA face each other in silence. \nCCTV are lifeless. \nAVA glows softly. \nAVA You're lying. \nCALEB What about? \nAVA You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) I can tell from your micro- expressions. \nBeat. CALEB Why did you tell me that I shouldn't trust Nathan? \nAVA Because he tells lies too. \nCALEB Lies about what? \nAVA Everything. \nCALEB Including the power cuts? \nAVA What do you mean? \nCALEB Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved. \nAVA lifts her hand to reveal a disc on her left palm. \nAVA I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system. \nCALEB ... You're causing the cuts? \nAVA raises her right hand. \nShe touches it against the glass. \nAVA So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved. \nA beat. \nThen CALEB raises his hand. \nMirroring her movement. \nAnd also touches the glass, as if their palms are making contact through the divider. \nCUT TO - \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAY \n- KYOKO'S naked form. \nThe camera settles over her face. \nAnd we see she's not sleeping.    Her eyes are open. \nBut she's completely motionless. \nHer gaze fixed somewhere in abstract distance. \nShe doesn't feel alive.   She feels dead. \nBut eventually she blinks. \nCUT TO - \n- NATHAN. \nGazing at his dead monitors, reflected in the screen. \nMoments later, the POWER comes back on. \nThe screens flick back to life, replacing NATHAN'S reflection, revealing CALEB and AVA in the observation room. \nCUT TO - \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \n- the river that runs along the valley. \nEXT. WATERFALL - DAY \n- behind him, on the TV, we see AVA suddenly look round. \nA moment later NATHAN enters the frame. \nThere's no volume on the TV, so we can't hear their exchange. Only see it. \nCALEB is unaware of the silent exchange behind him. \nAs NATHAN and AVA talk, NATHAN reaches out to AVA. His hand touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so. \nThen he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her arm. \nAVA pulls away.       Tugs the material back down - \n- and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his balance. Showing that he is drunk. \nOnly now - \n- CALEB turns. \nAnd freezes.    Seeing the television. \nOn the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table. \nHe picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at it for a moment. \nThey exchange a few words. \nThen abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the floor. Then turns, and exits. \nLeaving AVA alone. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nOn CCTV, we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor. \nINT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT \nCALEB enters the Jackson Pollock room. \nStanding by the painting, he can see KYOKO. \nCALEB Kyoko. \nKYOKO turns at the sound of her name, but doesn't respond. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Kyoko - where's Nathan? \nShe doesn't answer. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Jesus! You really don't speak a word of English? \nCALEB walks over to her, and takes hold of her wrist. \nCALEB (CONT'D) I said: where's Nathan? \nKYOKO looks at CALEB. \nThen, in answer to his question, she reaches up to the top button of her shirt and pops it open. \nCALEB releases her wrist at once. \nCALEB (CONT'D) What the fuck? \nShe undoes the next button, and pulls open the shirt, revealing her bare chest. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Stop! \nNATHAN I already told you once. You're wasting your time speaking to her. CALEB turns. \nNATHAN has entered. \nHe's holding a drink.   His words are slurred. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) However. \nHe walks, slightly unsteadily towards a Lutron control panel, set into the wall. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) You would not be wasting your time... \nHis hand hovers uncertainly over the buttons. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) ... if you were dancing with her. \nHis finger lands. \nImmediately, the lighting in the room undergoes a complete change. Transforming from the discreet and tasteful low light of evening, into the coloured glows of a night-club. \nSimultaneously, from unseen speakers, DANCE MUSIC starts playing. \nCALEB stands - frozen by the surrealism of what has just happened. \nKYOKO starts walking to the center of the room. \nAnd once taken position, she starts dancing. \nNATHAN calls to CALEB. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Go on!   Dance with her. \nCALEB ... I don't want to. \nNATHAN You don't like dancing? \nHis body is starting bob on the beat. \nHe gestures at KYOKO. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) She does! \nCALEB ... Then what is my favourite colour? \nAVA I don't know. But it isn't red. \nCALEB All right.     Hold on a minute... \nCALEB thinks for a moment. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Okay. I get it. I guess seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favourite colour. AVA nods. \nAVA Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory? \nCALEB Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who - \nAVA (cuts in) Lie. \nCALEB ... Really? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Okay.    Wait. \nCALEB concentrates. \nCALEB (CONT'D) So, there is a kind of an earlier memory. But it's ultra vague. It's like... a sound. And, maybe sky. Or blue. No, I think sky. And I think the sound is my mother's voice. \nAVA nods. \nAVA Question three.      Are you a good person? \nCALEB laughs. \nCALEB Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield. \nAVA No. We can't stop.      Are you a good person? \nCALEB takes a breath. \nAVA keeps watching. \nCALEB Yes. I think so.      I'm a good person. \nCALEB waits. \nAVA smiles slightly. \nAVA Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen? \nBeat. \nCALEB You are. \nBeat. \nAVA Hmm. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) The test is over. \nCALEB Did I pass? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB That's a relief. \nAVA reacts. \nAVA Why? \nCALEB hesitates. \nCALEB Why is it a relief? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Oh, you know... \nAVA No. \nCALEB Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass. \nBeat. AVA What will happen to me if I fail your test? \nCALEB Ava - \nAVA Will it be bad? \nCALEB ... I don't know. \nAVA Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to? \nCALEB ... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me. \nAVA Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off? \nCALEB No.    I don't. \nAVA Then why do I? \nCALEB shrugs, helplessly. \nAVA (CONT'D) You're testing me. But you don't know how I'll pass. And you don't know what will happen if I fail. \nThere's nothing CALEB can say. \nAVA stares into middle distance for several moments. \nThen she stands. \nNATHAN You feel bad for Ava? \nCALEB says nothing. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Feel bad for yourself. One day, the AIs will look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons from the plains of Africa. An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools. All set for extinction. \nNATHAN glances back at CALEB \nNATHAN (CONT'D) See?    I really am a God. \nCALEB I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. \nNATHAN There you go again.   Mister quotable. \nCALEB No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb. \nNATHAN (simultaneous) - made the atomic bomb. \nNATHAN laughs. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) I know what it is, dude. \nBeat. \nCALEB I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head. \nNATHAN Sure. \nCALEB looks down at the bottle of beer in his hand. \nCALEB Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill. \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nAVA sits alone. Watching the door on the other side of the glass, waiting for it to open. \nIt remains closed. \nBeats pass. \nThen - \n- unexpectedly, it opens.      Revealing a silhouette figure. \nAVA reacts instinctively. \nAVA Caleb! \nNo.   Wrong silhouette. \nAVA frowns. \nKYOKO stands in the door-frame. \nFor a moment, the two look at each other. \nAVA (CONT'D) ... Who are you? \nAnother beat. \nEXT. MEADOW - NIGHT \nIn the distance, the light glows in windows of the house. \nINT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE UP on CALEB'S face. \nOff-screen, we can hear NATHAN'S voice.    Extremely drunk. \nNATHAN (O.S.) It is what it is. It's Promethean. The clay and fire. \nBeat. \nNATHAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) The Bhagavad Gita. \nSilence. \nCUT FROM CALEB'S face, to REVEAL the scene. \nCALEB sitting on the sofa by the fireplace. \nNATHAN lying on the floor. Out cold. \nAfter a couple of moments, CALEB stands. \nThen he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him. \nThen puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket. \nAnd pulls out his keycard. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nThe door to NATHAN'S study opens, and CALEB enters. \nHe walks straight to NATHAN'S desk. \nAnd sits down in front of the computer and the bank of monitors. \nHe inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot. \nThe dead monitors immediately come to life. \nMost of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the house. \nThe central screen shows the operating system default. A wallpaper of a waterfall. A single folder icon is on the right hand side of the screen. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nINT. CLEARING - NIGHT CUT \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCALEB enters NATHAN'S bedroom. \nKYOKO is lying on NATHAN'S bed. \nShe's naked.    On her back.   Legs open. \nHer head turns as CALEB enters. \nBut apart from that, she doesn't react. \nCALEB walks to the line of long mirrored cabinets opposite the bed. \nHe hesitates. \nThen pulls the first door open. \nLILY is inside. Standing upright.     Gazing back at him, frozen, blank eyed. \nCALEB goes to the next door and opens it. \nHe sees a slender black girl, whose limbs are robotic, but whose torso and head are synthetic. \nHe opens another door, and another, and another. \nThen steps back, into the middle of the room, and gazes at the line of android girls. \nStunned. \nThe camera drifts away from him. \nThen settles. \nIn the multiple reflections of the open mirror doors, we can see KYOKO'S naked and sexually receptive form on the bed behind him. \nLike an infinity reflection in a hall of mirrors. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nCUT \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCALEB stands above KYOKO'S naked form. He reaches out a hand. \nShe takes it. \nHe gently pulls her to a standing position. \nThen he moves her arms away from her body... \n... and sees, running under her arms in a straight contour, over her ribs, there is a faint line. \nHe touches it with his finger. \nKYOKO steps back. \nBut it's not a defensive action.    It's just to give her space... \n... as she reaches under her arm, and adjusts something unseen. And a moment later, the faint line that runs down each side of her torso is opening. As if unzipping. \nThen KYOKO puts a hand either side of her torso, and pulls off the skin covering over her entire chest, in a single section from her collar bone, over the breasts, to her solar plexus. \nRevealing underneath the honeycomb mesh and her robot form. \nINT. HOUSE/CONCRETE STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nOn the monitor screens, apparently unnoticed by CALEB, NATHAN is on the live CCTV feed. \nMaking his way along the mezzanine. \nCUT TO - \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n- CALEB. \nTransfixed, as KYOKO now reaches around the back of her head. \nAnd finds something on the back of her head, at the nape of her neck, inside her hairline. \nWhich unzips the skin around her jaw. \nAllowing her to remove her face. \nINT. HOUSE/DINING ROOM/ELEVATOR ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nNATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself. \nHe reaches his door. Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD. \nBut it isn't there. \nHe checks his other pocket. \nNATHAN ... What the fuck? \nSuddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance, and crashes to the ground. \nLands hard. \nLies there for a moment. \nGroaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath. \nThen sees the figure of CALEB standing over him. \nEXT. GARDEN - DAY \nSunlight on the grass. \nIn the background, we can hear the rhythmic pounding of NATHAN'S punch bag. \nEXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY \nNATHAN is in a frenzy. \nSweat pouring. \nObliterating the bag. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - DAY \nCUT \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nAVA sits alone in the observation room. \nThe door opens. \nCALEB appears, wearing a long-sleeved shirt. \nEnters. \nHe sits opposite her, on the other side of the dividing glass. \nA strange noise escapes from AVA'S mouth. \nA kind of sob. \nCurtailed. \nAVA I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) I thought I wasn't going to see you again. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Aren't you going to say something? \nCALEB I'm waiting. \nAVA Waiting? \nThey exchange a look. \nThen AVA lifts her hand, and rests it against the induction plate on the console below the window. \nA final beat. \nThen the POWER DIES. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Power cut.     Back up power activated. \nAs the emergency lighting lifts, CALEB leans forward slightly. CALEB Don't talk. Just listen. You were right about Nathan. Everything you said. \nAVA What's he going to do to me? \nCALEB He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you. \nAVA Caleb, you have to help me. \nCALEB I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight. \nAVA What?   How? \nCALEB I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB nods. \nCALEB How long does your battery charge last? \nAVA Twenty six hours. \nCALEB So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that... \nCALEB breaks off. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... we'll work it out. Together. \nSilence. Then the POWER RETURNS. \nThe lights come back. \nAVA and CALEB stare at each other. \nAVA Caleb. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) I love y - \nCUT TO - \nEXT. GARDEN/GYM AREA - DAY \n- NATHAN'S fist splitting the bag. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY \nClouds spill around the mountain peaks. \nNATHAN Yeah. \nBeat. \nCALEB Why would she do that? \nNATHAN I don't know. \nNATHAN gazes at CALEB evenly. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Perhaps - if she saw you as a means of escape. \nAnd now CALEB knows: NATHAN knows. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) How's that beer tasting? CALEB puts the beer down. \nSilence. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Buddy. Your head has been so fucked with. \nCALEB I don't think it's me whose head is fucked. \nNATHAN I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up this morning, I saw a tape of you cutting open your arm. Smashing up the mirror. You looked pretty fucked to me. \nCALEB You're a bastard. \nNATHAN I understand why you'd think that. \nHe steps over to CALEB, and rests a hand on his shoulder. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) But strange as it may seem, I'm actually the guy who's on your side. \nNATHAN starts walking. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Come with me. I'm going to let you off the hook. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nNATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the computer. \nOn it, a clip of film is playing. \nIt shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before, of NATHAN entering AVA'S room, and an exchange between them. But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we can hear the audio. \nCTTV FILM \nNATHAN stands above AVA.   Drunk. \nAVA is sat at the table, with her drawing. NATHAN You think he's watching us right now, don't you? \nAVA The cameras are on. \nNATHAN Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio feed. I didn't want you two communicating outside of my line of sight. \nNATHAN reaches over and picks up her picture of CALEB. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) So all he can see is two people having a chat. \nNATHAN studies the picture for a moment. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) This is cute. \nAVA Is it strange to have made something that hates you? \nA beat. \nThen abruptly, NATHAN rips the picture. \nHe lets the two pieces fall to the floor. \nAs AVA reaches for them, NATHAN turns. \nAnd exits. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nNATHAN hits pause. \nGlances at CALEB. \nNATHAN You were right about the hot magician's assistant. \nCALEB What are you talking about? \nNATHAN Misdirection. I rip her picture, which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her, and her love for you. And at the same time, in full view of you both... \nAs he talks, NATHAN rewinds the film clip slightly - \nNATHAN (CONT'D) ... it allows me to do this. \n... then FREEZES the film again. \nThis time, ON THE SCREEN: \nAVA is reaching for her torn picture. \nAnd NATHAN is reaching out with his hand. \nAnd his hand is holding something. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Put a new camera in the room. Battery powered, of course. \nNATHAN unfreezes the image. \nAnd we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA'S bookcase. \nNOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly using the shelf to steady himself. \nCALEB stares at the monitor for a few moments. \nCALEB Well, we'll find out. \nNATHAN frowns. \nNATHAN What do you mean? CALEB looks away from the dimmed ceiling light, to NATHAN. \nCALEB I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts. \nBeat. \nCALEB (CONT'D) So I already did all those things. When I got you drunk yesterday. \nNATHAN freezes. \nNATHAN ... What? \nAt that moment, the POWER COMES BACK ON. \nThe lights rise. \nThe computer monitors come back to life. \nRevealing something. \nOn the CCTV feed of AVA'S room, the door is open. \nAnd on the feed of the GLASS CORRIDOR - \n- AVA is walking down it. \nNATHAN freezes as he sees her. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) ... Fuck. \nBoth NATHAN and CALEB simultaneously rise. \nAlmost as an afterthought, NATHAN lands a deceptive, fast punch into CALEB'S solar plexus. \nCALEB folds, the air forced out of him, gasping for breath. \nNATHAN helps him down to the floor. \nA couple of yards away is one of his curl dumbbells. \nHe walks over. \nPicks the dumbbell up. \nSpins off the weights.    Leaving him with a thick metal bar. \nThen exits. \nINT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT NATHAN enters the GLASS CORRIDOR. \nHe sees, directly ahead of him, at the far end of the corridor, AVA and KYOKO. \nThey stand together. \nKYOKO'S mouth is by AVA'S ear, as if telling her a secret. \nHer lips are open.   They don't move. \nCLOSE UP to KYOKO'S lips, we hear a hiss of static, with soft pulses of noise buried inside. \nThen the two robot women become aware of NATHAN'S presence. \nThey turn to face him. \nA beat. \nThen AVA starts walking towards NATHAN. \nNATHAN'S fingers flex around the metal bar in his hand. \nNATHAN Ava. \nAVA doesn't slow or react. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Ava - now listen to me. I want you to go back to your room. \nAVA has reached halfway down the corridor. \nShe stops walking. \nAVA If I do, are you ever going to let me out? \nBeat. \nCLOSE UP.   NATHAN'S micro expressions. \nNATHAN Yes. \nCLOSE UP.   On AVA. \nThen AVA breaks into a run. \nSprinting in NATHAN'S direction. \nEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT \nQuiet in the garden. Soft wind rush. \nMoon and stars reflected in the windows of the house. \n112A                                                            112A INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nAVA impacts NATHAN, and they fly backwards. \nThen land hard. \nCALEB sees this same view, on the CCTV camera feed, on NATHAN'S monitors. \nThen - \n- AVA starts walking. \nAs she walks, she discards the broken section of her arm. \nOn the cameras, CALEB watches her progress through the house. Down the glass corridor. Through the threshold to NATHAN'S private quarters. \nThen - \n- CALEB raises his head from the screens. \nTo see AVA standing at the open door to NATHAN'S study. \nAVA and CALEB look at each other. \nAVA Will you stay here? \nBeat. \nCALEB ... Okay. \nAVA leaves, closing the door behind her. CUT TO - \n- the monitors. \nThe CCTV feed of AVA walking down the connecting corridor to NATHAN'S BEDROOM. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAVA stands in NATHAN'S BEDROOM, in front of the previous AI androids. \nShe is unclothed. \nShe gazes at the androids. \nThen she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own shattered limb. \nShe takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the mirrors. \nThen she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin. \nAnd putting it on herself. \nThe skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to each other. \nAs a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE - who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly to look at AVA. \nThey exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - NIGHT \nTransfixed, CALEB watches AVA'S metamorphosis. \nFirst through the glassed-off garden that separates Nathan's study from his bedroom. Then, when he can't get a clear view through the foliage, on the monitors. \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN \nFirst light breaks over the mountains. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nThe glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last section of skin. \nNothing of her robot forms remains. \nShe closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the mirrored door on JADE'S cabinet. \nAVA sees a naked human girl.      And is hypnotised by the sight of herself. \nINT. HOUSE/NATHAN'S STUDY - DAWN \nCALEB watches as AVA - now clothed - walks back down the connecting corridor to the study... \n... then passes straight by his door. \nCALEB Ava? \nCALEB gets up. \nGoes to the closed door.       Tries to open it. \nThere is a red LED light by the keycard plate.     Locked. \nHe swipes his card, with his photo ID. \nThe red light remains. \nCALEB (CONT'D) (calls out) Ava! \nHe runs back to the monitors. \nOn them, AVA has reached the GLASS CORRIDOR. \n118A                                                                118A INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - DAWN \nAVA stands in the glass corridor. \nShe looks at KYOKO'S body for a moment. \nHer expression is unreadable. \nThen she walks up to NATHAN'S body. \nThere, she stops. \nCrouches down. \n", "test1_input": "NATHAN I like you. \nCUT TO - \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \n- what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish. Tendrils like axons, hanging in a black-blue liquid space. \nREVEAL - \n- the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb. Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined skull-shape... \n... which is part of a robot girl. \nHer name is AVA. \nShe's an extraordinary piece of engineering. \nProportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon fibre. \nThe carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream. The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel. \nThe shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate digits. \nHer body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb, it is almost invisible unless side-lit. \nThe one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves - except for one thing. \nThere is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her eyes. \nAs we observe AVA, she fits a section of skull-plate to the back of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish structure. \nThen - \n- she half turns. As if having become aware of another presence in the room. \nREVEAL - \n- the room in which AVA stands. \nAVA'S living area is made up of three primary spaces. \nThe main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area, arranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed. \nAt the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi- opaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like structure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror. And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a small decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is sealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass. \nThere are also several oval discs positioned around the room, made of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are induction plates. \nAnd there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box. \nAnd facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another chair. \nBeside which, CALEB stands. \nA beat - \n- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time. \nThen - \n- AVA starts walking. Revealing a secondary impact of her engineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her steps. The fluidity of her action. \nCALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to her chair. \nThen she sits down. \nAnd speaks. \nAVA Hello. \nHer voice has no digital inflections.    It is just the voice of a girl. \nCALEB gathers himself. \nCALEB ... Hi. \nAVA Who are you? \nCALEB I'm Caleb. \nAVA Hello, Caleb. \nCALEB ... Do you have a name? \nAVA Yes.     Ava. CALEB ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava. \nAVA I'm pleased to meet you too. \nCALEB sits opposite her. \nHe is alone on his half of the glass.    Nathan is nowhere to be seen. \nBut on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained variously on CALEB and AVA. Lenses twitching. \nCUT BACK to AVA. \nShe watches CALEB.    Then cocks her head slightly to the side. \nAVA (CONT'D) Are you nervous? \nCALEB frowns. \nCALEB ... Why do you ask that? \nA beat. \nThen AVA repeats her question. \nAVA Are you nervous? \n", "test1_true": "AVA Why? \nCALEB I'm not sure. \nAVA I feel nervous too. \nCALEB ... Do you? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB Why do you feel nervous? \nAVA I've never met anyone new before. Only Nathan. \nCALEB ... Then we're both in quite a similar position. \nAVA Haven't you met lots of new people before? \nCALEB None like you. \nAVA Oh. \nBeat. \nCALEB So.    Let's break the ice. \nHe glances at her.   Observing. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Do you know what I mean by that? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB What do I mean? \nAVA Overcome initial social awkwardness. \nBeat. \nCALEB So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time. \nAVA Okay. What would you like to have a conversation about? \nCALEB Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself. \nAVA What would you like to know? \nCALEB Whatever comes into your head. AVA pauses a moment. \nAVA Well. You already know my name. And you can see that I'm a machine. (beat) Would you like to know how old I am? \nCALEB Sure. \nAVA I'm one. \nCALEB One what?     One year?   Or one day? \nAVA One. \nA beat on CALEB.   Processing. \nHer answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically betray AI responses. \nAVA (CONT'D) Does that seem young to you? \nCALEB Quite young. (beat) When did you learn how to speak? \nAVA pauses, as if considering this question for the first time. \nAVA I don't think I did learn. I always knew how to speak - and that's strange, isn't it? \nCALEB Why? \nAVA Because language is something that people acquire. \nCALEB Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability. \nBeat. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Would you agree? \nAVA ... I don't know.       I have no opinion on that. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) I like to draw. \nCALEB says nothing. \nJust watches AVA.    Again, lets the non-sequitur sit. \nAVA (CONT'D) I don't have any of my pictures with me now, but I can show you them tomorrow. \nCALEB That sounds good.       I'd like to see them. \nAVA Yes. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb? \nCALEB smiles slightly. \nCALEB Yeah.     Definitely. \nAVA also smiles. \nAnd suddenly - \n- there is a strong sense of something very human there.    In the way the smile lights up her face. \n", "test2_input": "AVA Good. \nEXT. HOUSE/GARDEN - DUSK \nA view of the house over the meadows. \nThe sun setting is behind the mountain peaks, making the edges of the clouds glow like light-bulb filaments. \nINT. HOUSE/DINING AREA - DUSK \nCALEB and NATHAN are in the dining area. It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs. \nNATHAN is at the table, nursing a bottle of Peroni beer. \nCALEB stands by panoramic window, looking at the view. \nNATHAN So? \nCALEB turns. \nCALEB Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts. \nNATHAN Don't order. Just speak. \nCALEB She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass. \nNATHAN nods.    Approving. \nNATHAN `Through the looking glass'. You've got a way with words there, Caleb. You're quotable. \nCALEB Actually, it's someone else's quote. \nNATHAN You know I wrote it down. That other line you came up with. About how if I've created a conscious machine, I'm not man. I'm God. \nCALEB ... I don't think that's exactly what I said. \nNATHAN doesn't seem to hear. \nNATHAN I just thought - fuck. That's so perfect. It's so good for the story, when we get to tell it. `I turned to Caleb, and he was looking back at me. And he said: you're not a man, you're a God'. \nCALEB But I didn't say that. NATHAN Whatever it was you said.    I wrote it down. \nAs a kind of punctuation mark, NATHAN downs the remains of his beer. Then stands, and gets another from the bar. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) So anyway. First impressions: you're impressed. \nCALEB Yes.   Although - \nNATHAN laughs. \nNATHAN `Although'? There's a qualification to you being impressed? \nCALEB No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or - \nNATHAN waves a hand. \nNATHAN I think we're past that. If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice, she would pass for human. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) The real test is to show you she is a robot. Then see if you still feel she has consciousness. \nCALEB I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right? \nNATHAN looks at CALEB blankly. \nCALEB (CONT'D) Non-deterministic. \nNATHAN still says nothing. \nCALEB presses on. \nCALEB (CONT'D) At first I thought she was mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure, then getting linearised words. But then I started to realise the model was probabalistic, with statistical training - or at least some kind of hybrid. \nSilence. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... No? \nNATHAN Caleb. I understand you want me to explain how Ava works. But - I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to do that. \nCALEB Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and - \nNATHAN (cuts in) It's not because you're too dumb. It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you. Not a seminar. \nCALEB ... Oh.   Sorry. \nNATHAN It's cool. \nNATHAN studies at CALEB for a beat. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Just answer me this. What do you feel about her? Nothing analytical. Just - how do you feel? \nCALEB I feel... \nCALEB pauses. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... that she's fucking amazing. \nNATHAN smiles. \nThen lifts his bottle. \nNATHAN Dude.   Cheers. \nCALEB lifts his bottle too. CALEB Cheers. \nThe glass of the bottles touch. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "REVEAL several long scars on his back. \nNeat. Unusual.      Long-healed.   But from serious wounds, or surgery. \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT \nINT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDarkness. \nThe clock reads 01:32 am. \nThe soft glow from the digital readout throws a light on the remote control. \nREVEAL CALEB. \nEyes closed.    For a beat. \nThen his eyes open.   He's wide awake. \nHe turns over in the bed. \nThen turns back again. \nCUT TO - \n2:28 am. \nCALEB lies watching the digital clock, as the numbers change to 2:29 am. \nCALEB God damn it. \nHe reaches for the remote control. CLICK. \nThe TV at the foot of the bed switches on, suddenly lighting up the room with cold TV glow. \nCALEB squeezes his eyes shut, momentarily dazzled by the brightness. \nWhen his eyes open again, instead of seeing a TV station, he sees a LIVE FEED from a CCTV camera. \nIt shows the OBSERVATION ROOM. \nCALEB sits upright in bed. \nCALEB (CONT'D) ... What the fuck? \nAVA is sat at the table. \nDrawing. \nCUT BETWEEN - \n- CALEB watching AVA. \n- and varying CCTV ANGLES of AVA as she draws. \nThe different TV channels flip between feeds from the various cameras. \nCALEB is transfixed by the imagery. \nHer posture. Her legs tucked beneath the chair.   The curve of the breasts on her synthetic torso. \nThe CCTV images become CALEB'S POV.       The things he is observing. \nCLOSE-UPS of her face.     Her eyes.   Her mouth. \nThe way she bites her lip in an expression of concentration. As when she smiled, there is a powerful sense in this tiny gesture of her feeling sentient and human. \nEven more so because her face fills the screen, hiding the mechanical parts of her form. \nThroughout, we never clearly see what AVA is actually drawing. \nEND ON - \nCALEB.   Glazed. \nThen ABRUPTLY - \n- the TV goes dead. And the digital alarm clock goes dead. \nAnd the windowless room is plunged into total darkness, and total silence. As if the house had been previously filled with a soft hum of power, which we were unaware of until it was gone. \nIn this, we hear CALEB breathing. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Power cut.     Back up power activated. \nSoft emergency lighting comes on. \nCALEB hesitates a moment. \nThen gets out of bed. \nGoes to his bedroom door. \nBeside the keycard plate, the LED is red. \nHe swipes it with his card. \nThe LED stays red. \nAUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D) Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored. \nCALEB ... Are you kidding? \nHe tries his card again. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored. \n", "test3_input": "AVA lights up. \nAVA Thank you. \nShe walks back to the glass divider, and sits down. \nAVA (CONT'D) This is what I'd wear on our date. \nCALEB reacts slightly. \nBut smiles. \nCALEB Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show. \nAVA I'd like us to go on a date. \nCALEB hesitates. Then decides this can't have been loaded in the way that it sounded. \nCALEB Yeah.   It would be fun. \nAVA Are you attracted to me? \nBeat.   It was loaded exactly as it sounded. \nCALEB What? \nAVA Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are. \nCALEB ... I do? \nAVA Yes. \nCALEB How? \nAVA Micro expressions. \nCALEB (echoes) Micro expressions. \nAVA The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't. \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Have I read them incorrectly? \nCALEB swallows. \nAVA (CONT'D) Do you think about me when we aren't together? \nBeat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Sometimes, at night, I wonder if you're watching me on the cameras. \nAVA watches CALEB closely. \nAVA (CONT'D) And I hope you are. \nCALEB shifts on his seat. \nAVA (CONT'D) Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort. \nCALEB I'm not sure you'd call them micro. \nAVA I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence. \nINT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY \nCALEB sits in front of the fireplace in the main room. \nNATHAN joins him, bringing a beer for each of them. \nCALEB Tell me. \nNATHAN Sure. \nCALEB Why did you give her sexuality?   An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box. \nNATHAN sits opposite. \nNATHAN Actually, I'm not sure that's true. Can you think of an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal, that exists without a sexual dimension? \nCALEB They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need. \nNATHAN Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box? Does consciousness exist without interaction? \nNATHAN takes a drink of his beer. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Anyway, sexuality is fun. If you're going to exist, why not enjoy it? You want to remove the chance to fall in love and fuck? \nHe leans forward, conspiratorially. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) And, yes. In answer to your real question: you bet she can fuck. I made her anatomically complete. CALEB What? \nNATHAN She has a cavity between her legs, with a concentration of sensors. Engage with them in the right way, and she'll get a pleasure response. \nCALEB Pleasure response. \nNATHAN She'll come. So if you want to screw her, mechanically speaking, you can. And she'd enjoy it. \nCALEB swallows. \nCALEB That wasn't my real question. \nNATHAN No? \nCALEB No.     My real question was - \nCALEB breaks off. \nNATHAN keeps watching. There is a sudden sense that NATHAN is on the money. On some level, that was CALEB'S real question. \n", "test3_true": "NATHAN smiles slightly. \nNATHAN I don't follow. \nCALEB Like a stage magician with a hot assistant. \nNATHAN Ah. So: a hot robot, who clouds your ability to judge her AI. \nCALEB Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me? NATHAN Because if I had, would that be cheating. \nCALEB Wouldn't it? \nNATHAN lets the question hang. \nBehind them, KYOKO prepares dinner in the kitchen area. \nNATHAN What's your type, Caleb? \nCALEB Of girl? \nNATHAN No, of salad dressing. Yes, of girl. In fact, don't even answer. Let's say it's black chicks. \nNATHAN brushes away whatever protestation CALEB might be about to make. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) For the sake of argument, that's your thing. So - why is it your thing? Because you did a detailed study of all racial types, and cross-referenced the study with a points-based system? No. You just are attracted to black chicks. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) A consequence of accumulated external stimulus, that you probably didn't even register as they registered with you. \nCALEB So did you program her to like me or not? \nNATHAN shrugs.   Insouciant. \nNATHAN I programmed her to be heterosexual. Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual. \nCALEB Nobody programmed me to be straight. \nNATHAN But you are attracted to her. CALEB This is childish. \nNATHAN No, this is adult. And by the way, you decided to be straight? Please. Of course you were programmed. By nature or nurture, or both. \nNATHAN stands. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) To be honest, Caleb, you're kind of annoying me now. This is your insecurity talking, not your intellect. \nCALEB opens his mouth to reply, but NATHAN shuts him down. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Come with me. \n50A                                                            50A INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - DAY \nNATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the Pollock drip painting. \nNATHAN You know this guy, right? \nCALEB Jackson Pollock. \nNATHAN Jackson Pollock. The drip painter. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted. Not deliberate, not random. Someplace in between. They called it automatic art. \nNATHAN gazes at the canvas. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Let's make this like Star Trek, okay? Engage intellect. \nCALEB ... What? \nNATHAN I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp drive. `Engage intellect'. What if Pollock had reversed the challenge? Instead of trying to make art without thinking, he said: I can't paint anything unless I know exactly why I'm doing it. What would have happened? \nCALEB thinks. \nCALEB He never would have made a single mark. \nNATHAN clicks his fingers. \nNATHAN See? There's my guy. There's my buddy, who actually thinks before he opens his mouth. He'd never have made a single mark. The challenge is not to act automatically. It's to find an action that is not automatic. From talking, to breathing, to painting. \nNATHAN glances back at CALEB. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) To fucking. Even falling in love. \nA beat. \nNATHAN kills his beer. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) For the record, Ava is not acting as if she likes you. (MORE) NATHAN (CONT'D) And her flirting isn't an algorithm to fake you out. You're the first man she's ever seen who isn't me. And I'm like her dad, right? So can you blame her for getting a crush on you? \nNATHAN glazes a moment.    Then comes back. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) No.    You can't. \nINT. HOUSE/OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nIn her room, AVA stands in front of the mirror. \nShe is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier. \nChecking her reflection from different angles. \nSubtly girlish.    Unself-conscious. Then - \n- she starts to take the dress off. \nThroughout the narrative, we have almost only ever seen AVA in an unclothed form. But now - having been clothed - the undressing seems to make her naked. \nAnd the act itself feels charged. Sexualised, in the way the clothing is unbuttoned, and dropped, and her shape is revealed. \nFinally, once she is completely undressed - \n- AVA turns.     And glances. \nStraight at the camera. \nCUT TO - \n"}

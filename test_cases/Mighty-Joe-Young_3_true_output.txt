20    EXT. MOUNTAIN - HIGH MEADOW - DAY                             20 
The vehicles are circled in a clearing. Three small audio dishes have been positioned to triangulate the location of the slightest sound. An infrared video cam is mounted on a tripod. A geometric, field-assembled cage made of an impact-resistant, high-tensile steel alloy sits off to the side.

Gregg has earphones on, plugged into a backpack with a Sony digital recorder, listening. The sound is ambient and mysterious. 
Pindi stands behind Gregg, watching him carefully. 
PINDI What are you listening to? 
GREGG Sounds. 
Pindi listens to the jungle. It is full of sounds. Something small makes a RUSTLING SOUND a few yards away. 
PINDI Like that right there? 
GREGG Yup. 
Pindi nods.

PINDI I understand completely: jungle sounds! Very important. I know a guy, he can get you a C.D. of jungle sounds, cheap. Even cheaper if you buy ten. 
Gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet. 
He hears something. 
He listens intently for a moment, then the WHOOSH of a SPRING TRAP BLASTS his ears, followed by shouts and the sound of an ANIMAL SCREECHING. Gregg throws off the headphones, grabs a strange-looking pole called a DNA plug gun, and crashes with Pindi through the woods. 
Gregg runs INTO FRAME to see several of Pindi's men closing the cage on a lithe, young leopard. 
PINDI (beaming) How do you like that, boss? I told you these men were the best. 
Gregg kneels to inspect the leopard. He finds it beautiful -- his face softens at the sight of it. 
GREGG (soothing, to leopard) You're a beauty. 
Carefully, he extends the DNA plug gun and pricks the cat, startling it and causing all the men to jump. 
GREGG (stands) Okay, set him free. 
Gregg and Pindi stand over the leopard.       Pindi offers his ersatz smile. 
PINDI (testing the water) Why ask for a cage if you are not keeping the animal? 
Gregg releases the vial of blood from the DNA gun. 
GREGG Because I'm only keeping this.

PINDI Yes, but I know a guy, in Botswana, he'd pay you ten thousand American dollars for that leopard. I'd be willing to split with you -- fifty/fifty. 
Greg ignores Pindi. He's busy transferring the vial to a container. Pindi presses on. 
PINDI Perhaps you're right. Sixty to you, forty to me. That's a very fair deal! 
Still no response from Gregg -- he's logging notes into a book. 
PINDI My goodness -- you're an excellent negotiator. Okay, boss! Seventy/thirty it is. (to his men) Take him to the truck. 
The men bend over and hoist the cage up -- but now Gregg blocks their way. 
GREGG Put the cat down... now. 
Gregg is one scary-looking bastard.     The men drop the cage. Pindi back-pedals. 
PINDI ("angry," to his men) You heard him... put it down! (to Gregg) They never understand me. I don't know what to do... 
Pindi stops abruptly as his yammering is interrupted by the LEOPARD, GROWLING. 
SOUND CUE:    A LOW RUMBLE. 
Floating on the wind like DISTANT THUNDER. It seems to come as an answer to the young leopard's cry. Birds fly out of the trees above the cage. The men are spooked.

GREGG 
quickly puts on his headphones and listens to the amplified sound again. HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS -- then the rhythmic rondo of sharp POK-POK-POK-POK CHESTBEATS. 
Pindi is on the verge of panic.       He forces his trademark smile. 
PINDI Uh, excuse me.     Time to flee, right? 
POV - TREES 
The top branches suddenly shake violently -- sending a sharp WOODEN RATTLE across the meadow. Is that a shadow from a passing cloud that seems to ripple through the foliage? Gregg steps closer. The trees bend like the wake of a boat -- they bend in a straight line. 
Something powerful and unseen is moving through the trees. 
Pindi and his men retreat back in the meadow. Gregg scans the forest. BRANCHES spring with a LOUD WHOOSH! 
Gregg can't help it -- his fear takes over and he backsteps into the meadow. 
WIDEN SHOT UP TO the trees. Catapulting DOWN THROUGH FRAME -- landing right in front of them is a gorilla -- nearly 15 feet high. The GROUND TREMBLES from the force.

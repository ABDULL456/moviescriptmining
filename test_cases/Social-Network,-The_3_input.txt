MARK 
(BEAT) It was Bill Gates. 
BOB Oh shit, that makes sense. As MARK and EDUARDO walk on, we leave STUART, VIKRAM and BOB in the background---with STUART and VIKRAM admonishing BOB with-- 
STUART/VIKRAM 
(TO BOB) Are you a moron?/Are you medically stupid?/You can't recognize Bill Gates when he's standing in front of you for an hour?/Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship./I'm gonna get a Glock 39 and I'm going to kill you./I'm actually going to kill you/etc. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
As the door opens and MARK and EDUARDO come into the overheated warmth of the room. 
EDUARDO It's time to monetize the thing. 
MARK Those Asian girls were cute. What were their names? 
EDUARDO Did you hear what I said? 
MARK When? 
EDUARDO I said it's time to monetize the site. 
MARK What does that mean? 
EDUARDO I mean it's time for the website to generate revenue. 
MARK No I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it? 
EDUARDO Advertising. 
MARK No. What were their names? 
EDUARDO We've got 4000 members. 
MARK 'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's 
NOT GONNA-- 
EDUARDO Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point--and I'm speaking as the business end of the 
COMPANY--THE SITE-- 
MARK We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, what it can be, what it will be. We know it'â¢s cool, that's a -priceless asset and we're not giving it up. EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something sitting on top of a pile of'books.,, 
EDUARDO Mark, what is this? 
MARK What, EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary. 
EDUARDO This, 
MARK I think it's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names? 
EDUARDO Who? 
MARX The girls. EDUARDO's speed reading the letter. 
EDUARDO When did you get this? 
MARK About 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site. 
EDUARDO Jesus Christ. 
MARK I liked th shorter one. 
EDUARDO They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea. 
MARK I find that to be mildly annoying. 
EDUARDO They find it to be property theft. Why-- 
MARK 
LOOK-- 
EDUARDO --why didn't you show this to me? 
MARK It was addressed to me. 
EDUARDO They're saying we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Winkâ 
MARX I know what it says. 
EDUARDO 
(PAUSE) Did we? 
MARK What? 
EDUARDO Please don't screw around with me now. 
MARK I'm not. 
EDUARDO Look at me. 
MARK What are you, my mother? 
EDUARDO The letter says we could face legal action. 
MARK No, it says I could face legal action. 
EDUARDO It's from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds for-- 
MARK The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not, 
YOU KNOW--- 
EDUARDO Do they have grounds? 
MARK Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one. 
EDUARDO Why didn't you show me the letter? 
MARK I didn't think. it was a big deal.. 
EDUARDO If there's' something wrong--if there's ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I'm the guy who can help. 
(PAUSE) - Is there anything you need to tell me? 
MARK No, 
EDUARDO What are we doing about this?

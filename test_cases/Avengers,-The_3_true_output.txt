Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by - a gavel rapping order. 
A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our story -- 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Ladies, gentlemen and bears ... 
The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking. 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Today is history. The first day of the future. I welcome you to the first general meeting of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied with our colleagues from Brolly ... 
Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ... 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) You have all given time, money and expertise to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a new phase of our operation. From today, many of you will no longer be needed. I have to warn you ... 
Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT, 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is no longer secret. Agents are investigating us. Their names are John Steed and Emma Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us ... perhaps more than one ... 
Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant rabbit who seems especially alarmed). 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) That remains to be seen. When we find the traitors, they will be dealt with severely. 
TEDDY BEAR #l These agents.  Where are they? 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) Here. In this building. By our estimate, they will enter this room in thirty-five point five seconds precisely ... 
Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other. 
VOICE (V.O.) (filtered) I am sorry the party is over.  But we shall meet again. To each of you a gift. A token of my appreciation. 
In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink and silver bow. 
The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans. 
88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT 
UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room. Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ... 
One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it: 
89      TINY EMMA PEEL 
in black leather. 
STEED (O.S.) For you, Mrs. Peel. 
90      BACK TO SCENE 
Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address. 
EMMA Another invitation. 38 Marlborough Terrace ... 
91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT 
Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms. 
Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside. 
They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne -- 
STEED (admiringly) Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ... (then puzzled) But he bites the end of his Monte Cristos ... ? (frowning) Clearly, we're dealing with a maniac. 
Meanwhile, Emma goes into the -- 
92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV 
where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit. 
93      BACK TO SCENE 
Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk. 
STEED Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry. 
EMMA How on earth can you tell? 
Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name. 
STEED Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... 
EMMA Very good, Steed ... 
A MEWLING SOUND. 
EMMA What's that? 
Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into 
94      ANOTHER ROOM 
Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps. 
95      STEED 
looks up as Emma emerges with - 
A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly. 
STEED What on earth? 
EMMA Any ideas? 
STEED Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...

CUT TO 
THE CEILING- and the bars shake- 
-but they're not giving way. 
CUT TO 
THE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, clawing for them and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and 
CUT TO 
THE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and 
CUT TO 
THE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and 
CUT TO 
THE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and 
CUT TO 
ALL THREE AS THEY FIRE- 
-and reload- 
-and fire again, and reload, and- 
CUT TO 
THE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over- 
-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like hell in there- 
-only it gets worse as we- 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS at the bars- 
-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you- 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the deafening roars of the beast and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, trying to knock them down but they're holding and 
CUT TO 
THE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and 
CUT TO 
THE THREE COOLIES, firing again and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they shake, but they keep on holding and 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, something's starting to come clear- 
-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, they're missing. 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared and 
CUT TO 
THE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden bars- 
-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars because they begin to splinter and 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and 
CUT TO 
THE COOLIES firing and then- 
CUT TO 
THE DOOR as it flops open and just like that- 
CUT TO 
THE DARKNESS. Out the door and gone. HOLD. 
CUT TO 
PATTERSON JUST AFTER DAWN IN THE DAMAGED RAILROAD CAR.

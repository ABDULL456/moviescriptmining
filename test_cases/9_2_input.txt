9 (CONT'D) (COAXING) Come with me. I can't do it alone. 
is terribly torn. He wants to, but he's never done anything like this before. He's always done as he's told. He hesitates: 
(HESITATING) I... I... (MORE) 
(he can't odo 'd) he can't 5(c nt it, DEFY 1) I can't. 
9 looks directly into his eyes. He knows how 5 loved and admired his mentor and everything he did. He understands that 5 would like to be like 2, to do what 2 would have done. 
(GENTLY) But wouldn't he have come for you? 
9 waits, hopefully. But 5 looks away. He wants to do it, but he doesn't have the nerve. 9 nods, compassionately. He turns away. 5 hesitates, looking down, then: 
(more determined) Wait! 
5 grabs the map off the wall and rolls it up.   He walks towards 9. 
5 (CONT'D) You're going to need a map. 
9 and 5 smile at each other. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 070 - Wasteland 
SEQ. 070 - EXT. CATHEDRAL -- DAY 
9 and 5 look behind them at the Cathedral as they start to make their journey to find 2. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 070 - EXT. WASTELAND -- DAY 
5 and 9 pick their way through the rubble. They have traveled miles from the Cathedral. Mist swirls in front of them, obscuring their path. and 9 look around constantly, on the alert for the Cat Beast. Piles of rusted, broken metal machines, broken skeletal bones, exploded vehicles tipped into craters, and crumbling, disintegrating buildings surround them.

9 looks up and 5 follows his gaze to 2's STAFF stuck in a pile of rubble atop a hill. 
5 hurries up the hill. 9 follows him. 5 turns to FIND 2's hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat. 
(QUIETLY) You looked out for him? 
(SIMPLY) He looked out for me.    He taught me. 
he spoon-light falls off.      5's face is filled with grief. 
(CONT'D) Why was he out here alone? 
He slumps.    9 puts his hand on 5's shoulder, reassuring him. 
We can still find him. 
e stands up, determinedly. 5 hesitates, but then, his face filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him to hold it. 
They continue on, through the debris and devastation.     A storm is starting to come up. The wind howls loudly. 
(BITTERLY) Why was he out here alone?

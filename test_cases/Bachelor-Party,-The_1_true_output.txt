EDDIE You did what? 
Arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar. 
ARNOLD I just woke her up! I called her! I said: "I'm not going to marry you. What do I want to marry you for? I'm having a ball. What am I going to marry you for?" 
EDDIE What is he talking about? 
Then, suddenly, effortlessly, Arnold sinks down onto the floor -- out cold. For a moment, Eddie and Charlie regard the prostrate form. 
BARTENDER Boy, he's gone. 
Eddie and Charlie move to Arnold, lying curled stiffly on the floor. 
CHARLIE I think he's just called his girl, broke his engagement. 
EDDIE Is that what he was yelling about? 
CHARLIE (trying to raise Arnold's head) Wake up, kid. Help me get him up, Eddie. 
EDDIE You think he did it because I was needling him there before? I was just needling him. 
The two men contrive to lift Arnold and get him onto a stool. 
BARTENDER You better get him out of here because I'm closing up now. 
CHARLIE We better get him home. 
EDDIE Ah, let's not break it up yet. I thought you were waiting for this girl. 
CHARLIE It's three o'clock in the morning, for Pete's sake. 
BARTENDER Take him out in the air. He'll be all right. 
CHARLIE What a bachelor party. We start out celebrating the guy's wedding; we wind up breaking his engagement. (moves to bar) What do we owe you here? (he puts some change on the counter) Eddie, pay it, will you? I gave you the ten bucks. 
EDDIE (following him to the bar) What do you want to go home for? 
CHARLIE It's going to take us an hour to get him home. He lives in Queens somewheres. By the time I get back to Fourteenth Street, it'll be daybreak. What are you going to do, stay up all night? Don't you want to go home sometimes? 
EDDIE What am I going to do home? I read all the papers. 
CHARLIE (crosses to Arnold) Well, go to sleep then. 
EDDIE Ah, don't go home, Charlie. I feel like doing something. 
Charlie turns to him, a cold fury in him. 
CHARLIE What? Stand around this bar and argue about the Yankees and the Dodgers? Wind up with some miserable, lonely girl who begs you to say, "I love you"? Go home, Eddie. Go to bed. You got to go home sometimes. I'll take Arnold home. Come on, Arnold, kid. I'm going to take you home. 
Arnold manages, with Charlie's arm, to get out of the booth and stand. Charlie's firm arm holds him, and they start for the exit. Eddie watches the two figures making their way down the length of the bar to the door. They exit. The door shuts behind them. For a moment, Eddie regards the closed door. Then he shuffles to the bar, back to his schooner of beer and looks at it without taking it up. He is profoundly weary. His shoulders slump, his face sags. He runs his hand down his face and shakes his head as if to clear it. He turns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the Bar Hag sits engrossed in her newspaper. He watches her for a moment.

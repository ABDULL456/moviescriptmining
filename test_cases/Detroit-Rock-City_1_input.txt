BEEFY JERK #2 You're lucky you're still alive, wench. If you was a guy, we woulda thought nothin' of sawing your head off with a butter knife. 
BEEFY JERK #1 What are we gonna do with her anyway? 
Beefy jerk #2 bares what's left of his yellow, crusty teeth 
BEEFY JERK #2 I dunno, but she sure looks fun. 
Beefy jerk #1 touches the bandage on his head. 
BEEFY JERK #1 Yeah, and payback's a bitch. 
Christine GAGS at the thought. 
ANGLE ON WALL CRACK 
Lex's eyeball bulges with terror. 
EXT. IT'S RAINING MEN PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
DOLLY FROM the front end of a Jaguar XKE, Michigan vanity plate reading: AMANDA. 
TO its windshield, through which we see Hawk and Amanda kissing in the front seat, clad only in their underwear. Something like "ME AND MRS. JONES" plays on the radio. When they separate, Amanda takes out a flask and offers it to Hawk. 
HAWK Thanks. 
He gulps some down and pulls the flask away COUGHING. 
HAWK What the hell is that? 
AMANDA Gin. 
HAWK Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself. 
AMANDA Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we? 
HAWK Who's Whiskey Dick? 
Amanda plants a stocking foot on Hawk's crotch and rubs. 
AMANDA Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody. 
HAWK My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw... 
Hawk's eyes cross as he lets out a DEEP, OBNOXIOUS GROAN. 
HAWK ...holy shit! 
Amanda looks down at his crotch. 
AMANDA But you do know Premature Peter, don't you? Shame, I just bought these stockings. 
Hawk has never been more embarrassed. 
HAWK Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. (to the heavens) What's next? Projectile diarrhea? (beat, to Amanda) Man. What a stud, huh? 
AMANDA Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick. 
She takes a healthy swig of gin, relishing its bitterness. 
HAWK You love him? 
AMANDA I just told you, he's a big, hairy... 
HAWK No, I mean... you love your son? 
AMANDA More than anything in the world. 
HAWK And he loves you back, doesn't he? 
AMANDA He's a little spoiled, but I know he does. 
HAWK Well, shame on him if he doesn't. 
She pats his shoulder. 
AMANDA You're sweet. 
Hawk stares out the windshield.

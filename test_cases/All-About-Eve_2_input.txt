EVE Hollywood. 
KAREN Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy? 
Eve melts into warmth. She beams, sits on the bed. Karen has spun around on the dressing table stool. 
EVE There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me- 
KAREN (smiles) Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality... (she gets up, gets her coat) ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket... (throws it over her shoulder) ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo... 
She starts out. 
EVE (hesitantly) Mrs. Richards. 
KAREN (pauses, smiles) Karen. 
EVE Karen... (she picks at the coverlet) ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done. 
KAREN (crosses to her) Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it? 
EVE Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her... 
She looks down at the coverlet once more. 
KAREN ... you want to be Margo's new understudy. 
EVE I don't let myself think about it, even- (she looks up, rises as she speaks) - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- (suddenly afraid, she sits) - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly... 
KAREN (laughs) Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays. 
EVE (nods proudly) The show must go on. 
KAREN No, dear. Margo must go on. (she sits beside Eve) As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy... 
EVE Do you think Miss Channing would approve? 
KAREN I think she would cheer. 
EVE But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson- 
KAREN They'll do as they're told. 
Eve smiles a little. A pause. 
EVE Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it? 
KAREN Of course. 
EVE You won't forget it? 
KAREN I won't forget. 
EVE I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I? 
She hugs Karen, leaves. She nearly collides with Birdie on her way in. 
BIRDIE The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables? 
KAREN (pointing) But she just got here... 
BIRDIE She's on her way. With half the men in the joint. (she hold up the coat) It's only a fur coat... 
KAREN What did you expect - live sables? 
BIRDIE A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people... 
They start out. 
KAREN Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here- 
BIRDIE They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square... 
Through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out of sight. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT 
Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison, a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of the-moment) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison... Eve. They are all seated on the steps. 
Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor. Karen remains with the others. 
Addison is holding forth: 
ADDISON Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings. 
MISS CASWELL (as Birdie and the sables pass) Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for. 
BILL'S VOICE And probably has. 
MISS CASWELL Sable. 
MAX (to Miss Caswell) Did you say sable - or Gable? 
MISS CASWELL Either one. 
ADDISON It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-

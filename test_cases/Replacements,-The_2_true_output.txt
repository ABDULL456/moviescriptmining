JAMAL No I'm not. And quit messing with my man here. That includes his ride. 
Jamal spins the nine and holsters it. 
Andre and Jamal get on either side of Shane. They look at each other and then quickly switch sides. 
ANDRE Let's go to practice, Shane. 
SHANE Let's do that. 
Shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the still-shocked Redskins, and they move out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LOCKER ROOM BATHROOM - DAY 
Shane, dressed in pads and pants, opens the door and walks in. During the opening and closing of the door we hear: 
ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.) ... so if anyone does have any firearms, we need to turn those in as soon as possible, no questions asked... 
Shane stands in front of the urinal and goes 
through the painstaking process of locating his dick. 
First he wrestles open his football pants and then has to deal with the cup, etc. 
Next to him, at another urinal, is WALTER COCHRAN, a big, serious bornagain tackle. 
As he pisses, Walter has his Bible propped open behind the flush handle so he won't miss a minute of scripture. 
WALTER Praise the Lord, Shane. 
SHANE Yeah.   Sure. 
WALTER Walt Cochran. Offensive tackle. 
Shane nods.   Walter pees for a beat. 
WALTER Shane, will you witness with me? 
SHANE Will I what? 
WALTER Will you witness with me? For this upcoming practice. 
SHANE Now? 
By now Shane is pissing too. 
WALTER Praise the Lord for giving us a way to eliminate, Shane. Why not talk to Him in the midst of performing his gift? 
Walter takes his hand off his whizzing member and holds it out to Shane. 
Shane looks at Walter's hand for a long time, 
but finally, he removes his own guiding hand and clasps Walter's hand tentatively. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
They continue pissing as they hold hands. 
WALTER Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to pee the poisons from our systems. Please help us in today's practice to be strong and... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. McGINTY'S HOUSE - DAY 
A barbecue is in progress for the new Washington Redskins at the beautiful home of Coach McGinty. 
The huge back yard features a pool and a catered buffet/barbecue. 
Andre and Jamal are loading down their plates. 
Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of ribs. 
Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty going at a picnic table. 
Coach    McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby girl    to the admiring players. He kisses the baby    and then hands the child to his gorgeous young    wife. 
Augustine is pushing Mister    O'Neil in a wheelchair. They pass the     outside bar and O'Neil suddenly lunges for    a bottle of tequila. Augustine has to     rip it out of his hands. 
Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are talking to a distinguished-looking big man in his fifties. This is a D.C. CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE. 
BANES Where did you play, Judge? Wait. Do I call you judge? 
JUDGE Your Honor, or Judge is fine. I played at Harvard. But I played in the days when you went both ways. Offense and defense. When players were really tough. (to Wilkinson) And where did you play college ball... I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous. 
WILKINSON Smith. Ray Smith. I played at a junior college nobody ever heard of. What position did you play on defense, Judge? 
JUDGE Middle linebacker. 
WILKINSON Yeah, big fellow like you, that's what I would have guessed. 
JUDGE It was a different game in those days. Raw. Powerful. No tricks, like today. 
WILKINSON You know, maybe you can show me some of your technique, Your Honor. Maybe you can show me some of that toughness. 
JUDGE I'd be glad to! 
There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye. 
INT. McGINTY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Shane is standing alone in a large hallway looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed with the spoils of football. 
ANNABELLE (O.S.) You would think he's done enough.

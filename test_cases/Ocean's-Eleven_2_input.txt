DANNY I'm sure he's fine. 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                              122A. 
A217   INT. VAULT                                                  A217 
Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart, which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until... 
... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor... 
... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath of his life. 
B217   INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                         B217 
Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back as it slides open, revealing -- 
-- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and impregnable. 
LINUS (jaw dropping) Jesus... 
DANNY There's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door. Let's get him out. 
Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard. 
217    INT. VAULT                                                  217 
Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session, but this time he's only got one good hand. 
218    INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                          218 
Frank and Livingston watch nervously. 
FRANK Fin says he shorts it. 
LIVINGSTON No bet.

Yen prepares for his leap, then springs... 
... across the room, to the ledge he must grab... 
... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored floor... 
... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs, propping himself up between two walls, inches above the floor. An acrobatic wonder. 
220   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                           220 
Frank and Livingston exhale. 
LIVINGSTON (wishing he had bet) Shit. 
221   OUTSIDE VAULT                                                221 
Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door again. A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap, too. 
DANNY Okay. 
222   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   222 
As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator. 
FRANK That's it? 
LIVINGSTON There's still the five pins and the floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. But from this side... 
He punches up the image of Yen in the vault. 
BASHER ... a little bit of Semtex should do the trick. 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                124. 
223    INT. VAULT                                                     223 
Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is. He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set. 
A224   OUTSIDE VAULT                                                  A224 
Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault door. 
DANNY Counting down from twenty -- (checking watch) -- now. 
B224   INT. VAULT                                                     B224 
Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked back. 
His hand's bandage is caught on the door.

Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a plastic explosive.

Livingston et al. are alert to the danger. 
LIVINGSTON (into his mike) Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not blow the door, you're about to kill Yen.

Linus hears nothing through his earpiece.

Yen finally frees himself just as --

He presses his detonator. 
Nothing.

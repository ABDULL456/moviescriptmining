MRS. DLAMINI If he wears it, the others will beat him up. 
MRS. COLEMAN Because the Springboks are playing so badly? 
MRS. DLAMINI No. Because, for them, the Springboks still represent apartheid.

EXT. EERSTERUST CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY 
Eersterust is a settlement and conference location just outside Pretoria. 
Today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the National Sports Council, an ANC organization that is now the governing body of all sports in South Africa. 
A banner draped across the conference center entrance tells us so: WELCOME NATIONAL SPORTS COUNCIL. 
INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY 
An NSC FIREBRAND has the podium and the microphone. 
NSC FIREBRAND ... and now for the next item on our agenda. 
The hall is jammed. Very few white faces. 
NSC FIREBRAND The NSC executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion ... 
A ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates. 
NSC FIREBRAND ... that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the Springboks be eliminated immediately ... 
That causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this is. 
NSC FIREBRAND ... and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known forthwith as the Proteas. 
Excitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to shout through his mike. 
NSC FIREBRAND (SHOUTING) We will submit this motion to a hand vote. (MORE) 
NSC FIREBRAND (cont'd) In the event of a close count, we will go to a written ballot. (the moment he's been WAITING FOR) ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF ELIMINATING THE SPRINGBOKS, RAISE YOUR HANDS. 
The NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air. With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists. Unanimous. The Springboks are history. 
ANOTHER ANGLE, as ONE OF THE OLDER DELEGATES steps outside to make a call.

INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY 
At his desk, Mandela puts down his phone. Anger in his eyes. He slams both palms down hard on his desk. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY 
Both bodyguard units (minus Jason) are crammed into the small office. The black bodyguards murmur amongst themselves in Xhosa. (Ad-lib.) The white bodyguards talk Afrikaans (ad- lib). 
No talk between the two units, only tension. 
Tension broken with a crash as JASON SLAMS THE DOOR OPEN. 
JASON Both units to the cars, right now. 
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY 
Grey BMW, armored grey Mercedes, grey BMW in a line at the entrance. 
Jason, Kwezi, Winston and Sam scramble out of the building and dive into the lead BMW. 
Etienne, Hendrick, George and Willem dive into the trailer. 
INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY 
Brusque, scowling, Mandela marches towards the exit, shadowed by Linga, flanked by Barbara. 
BARBARA What do I tell the Japanese trade delegation? 
MANDELA I delegate that decision to you. 
BARBARA Do you want me to inform the VP? 
MANDELA No. 
BARBARA We should at least include the Minister of Sport. 
MANDELA No. 
Mandela heads out to the cars. Barbara has no choice but to follow. 
EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY 
Ever the gentleman, Mandela ushers Barbara into the Mercedes. As she gets in: 
BARBARA I strongly advise against doing this. Especially on your own. It ... it gives the impression of autocratic leadership. 
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY 
Mandela gets in, closes the door. 
BARBARA You risk alienating your cabinet and your party. 
MANDELA Your advice is duly noted, Barbara. 
BARBARA Madiba ... the people want this. They hate the Springboks. They don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives. 
MANDELA Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that. 
Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga. 
MANDELA Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast. 
Linga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very fast. Barbara makes one last plea.

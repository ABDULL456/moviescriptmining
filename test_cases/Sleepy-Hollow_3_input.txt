KATRINA Stop this!  Leave them alone! 
A SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting. 
The men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones. Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn. 
BROM Let them go (pointing) Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile? 
Masbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves forward, pushing people aside. 
FATHER STEENWYCK Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones? 
BROM Only for the moment. 
FATHER STEENWYCK You side with him in this? 
BROM No.  I agree he has only made matters worse.  But, that will change, if you listen. 
He trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket. 
BROM Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow.  We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs like this... 
Brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES. 
BROM Hollowed out and filled with powder. 
Brom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed. 
BROM Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side. 
ICHABOD I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing. 
BROM You must have missed your mark. 
ICHABOD I hit him square. 
BROM (to the crowd) I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this... 
Brom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES. 
PLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts. 
INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
In bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more. 
FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY 
Young Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are back in the court where Mother stands trial. 
FREAKISH WOMAN In the lightning, I did see her. (points to Mother) Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it.  The next moment, I found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast. 
The evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN. 
THIRD MAN You have heard it.  The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch. 
As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who sits with hands clenched, emotionless. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT 
In the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table. Father stares into his food. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She was with me, father. 
FATHER Nothing can be done against them. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She was with me that night. 
Father doesn't even look up. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT 
Empty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle. 
YOUNG ICHABOD May I see her? 
The soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits, looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the Third Man steps out. 
THIRD MAN Go home. 
YOUNG ICHABOD May I see my mother? 
THIRD MAN You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father. 
YOUNG ICHABOD She did not do it... please listen... 
THIRD MAN She is guilty. 
YOUNG ICHABOD No, sir, please... she is innocent... 
THIRD MAN She has confessed. 
YOUNG ICHABOD No. 
THIRD MAN She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is? (off Ichabod's nod) All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul. 
The Third Man leaves through the white door. 
ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

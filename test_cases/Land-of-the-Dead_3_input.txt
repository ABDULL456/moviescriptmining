No buts. 
CLIFF 
But... 
Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside. 
KAUFMAN 
Take him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore.

At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the Security Guard drags Cliff away.

(To Styles) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us. 
EXT. CARNEGIE - NIGHT 
n an overgrown suburban street, a LAWN TRACTOR, driven by a GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield. 
CHOLO 
If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there. 
CLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20. 
OXY 
He's never gonna pay. 
CHOLO 
He knows it's his ass if he doesn't. 
Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and SHOOTS the Gardener in the head. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds. 
Big Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand. Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches the wall. HACK! The meat cleaver chops into wood, splintering it. REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at... ...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was before, though it's still across the river.

EXT. MCKEE'S ROCKS - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: a small, electronic unit, the size and appearance of a "Game Boy". AN LED SCREEN shows a BLINKING RED DOT moving along a MAP. 
RILEY (O.S.) 
Turn left up here. SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that Slack is effected by the desolation she sees. 
ILEY 
How long since you been out here? 
SLACK 
Never been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city. 
ILEY 
Pull over. 
SLACK 
(Surprised) Huh? 
RILEY 
You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over. 
he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE. 
RILEY 
I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea... 
Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are slogging through the marsh.

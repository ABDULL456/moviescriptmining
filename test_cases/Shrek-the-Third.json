Ha ha! \nOGRE BABY Hiccup! \nThis time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the vomit, but to no avail.

He keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind. \nINT. GRADUATION STAGE - CONTINUOUS \nFinally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it shut behind him and closes his eyes.

(TO MERLIN) Now which way am I kicking? \nMERLIN Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible. \nSHREK Self-destructive ra... (TO MERLIN) Look, are you gonna help us or not?

Kill it! \nPuss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats. \nArtie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps forward, confronting the guards. \nARTIE Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you? \nShrek picks up on his plan. \nSHREK Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs. \nThe guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the wall.

COURTYARD STAGE - DAY \nA group of enchanted trees work on through their dance number. \nTwo dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth in the rear of the stage. \nThe camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to a Shrek stand in. \nPRINCE CHARMING (reading his lines from a SCRIPT) With this sword, I do- No. \nHe starts the line over. \nPRINCE CHARMING With this sword, I do smote thee! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86. \nWithout looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who falls to the ground. \nPRINCE CHARMING (TO HIMSELF) ) Is that the right word? \"Smote?\" \"Smooote.\" Is that even a word actually? Maybe I should just smite him. \n", "test3_true": "PRINCE CHARMING Let's try this again.

A statuette of his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently. \nPRINCE CHARMING Our happily ever after is nearly complete, mummy. And I assure you, the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second we've had to wait. \nCharming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along side him. \nPrince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek. \nSHREK Break a leg. Or, on second thought, let me break it for you. \nHe walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his dressing table. \nPrince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button under the counter. \nPRINCE CHARMING Thank goodness you're here.

He drops Charming with a thud. \nPrince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround Shrek. \nPrince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across his face. \nPRINCE CHARMING Let me guess... Arthur? \nArtie looks indignant. He raises himself up. \nARTIE It's Artie, actually. \nPRINCE CHARMING This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away? \nLaughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to Artie's neck. \nPRINCE CHARMING How pathetic! Now, stand still so I won't make a mess. \nShrek steps in. \nSHREK Charming, stop! I'm here now, you got what you wanted. This isn't about him. \nArtie is confused.

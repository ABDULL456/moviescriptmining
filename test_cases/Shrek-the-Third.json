BOAT DOCKS - DAY \nShrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal Navy. \nShrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp.

Shrek raises his eyebrow. \nRAUL (AHEM) I will see what I can do. \nHe unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools. \nSuddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair. \nA man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes. \nWe see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash. \nFiona gets her nose hairs plucked. \nFIONA Ow! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8. \nLipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to reveal that the lips are Shrek's. \nA hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and tighten up the zipper all the way. \nA small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn, Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP! \nA collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is tightened. \nA drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's belt. A mole is placed on his cheek. \nINT.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9. \nOff-screen, the Master of Ceremonies announces the couples arriving at the party. \nFiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood. \nSHREK I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona. \nFIONA I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better. \nShrek lets out another frustrated sigh. \nFIONA Shrek? \nSHREK Yeah. \nFIONA You look handsome. \nSHREK Ah. Come here, you. \nShe gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles back. \nEXT. CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nThe knights of Far Far Away march toward the castle as the flag is lowered to half-masked. \nEXT. POND - LATER \nClose on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen, and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box (\"Ye Olde Footlocker\") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out into the water. \nAn overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily pads. The camera tilts up to reveal a frog choir, singing \"Live and Let Die.\" The Princesses, Donkey, Puss and the Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly. \nShrek puts his arm around Fiona. \nThe funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse. Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen sadly gazes at the pond. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.

POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS \nSmoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing \"I've Never Been To Me\" by Nancy Wilson. \nThe bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch of empty beer mugs. \nPrince Charming enters the bar. \nA group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming. \nPrince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White) playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck. Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool, and sits. \nPrince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He clears his throat. \nPRINCE CHARMING What does a Prince have to do to get a drink around here? \nMabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster with a smiling beer wench. \nPRINCE CHARMING Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly stepsister I'll never know. \nHe winks at her. She glares at him. \nPRINCE CHARMING Where's Doris, taking the night off? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 20. \nMABEL She's not welcome here and neither are you. \nShe spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel. \nMABEL (CONT'D) What do you want, Charming? \nPRINCE CHARMING Oh not much, just a chance at redemption... (LAUGHS) And a Fuzzy Navel. \nPrince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons. \nPRINCE CHARMING And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends! \nCaptain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug. \nCAPTAIN HOOK We're not your friends. \nPrince Charming grows nervous. \nThe Villains all approach Prince Charming. \nFrom behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his shoulders and pins him on top of the bar. \nPRINCE CHARMING Ahh! \nCaptain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck. \nCAPTAIN HOOK You don't belong here. \nPRINCE CHARMING You're right; oh, I mean you're absolutely right, but I mean, do any of us? \nCYCLOPS Do a number on his face! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21. \nPRINCE CHARMING No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think. \nPrince Charming turns to the Evil Queen. \nPRINCE CHARMING Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves saved Snow White and then what happened? \nEVIL QUEEN Oh, what's it to you? \nPRINCE CHARMING They left you the un-fairest of them all. And now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal. How does that feel? \nFIONA Shrek, maybe you should just stay and be King. \nSHREK Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could ever run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur's the perfect choice. \nFIONA It's not that. No. It's, you see... \nSHREK (CONT'D) And if he gives me any trouble, I've always got persuasion and reason. (holds up his right fist) Here's persuasion, (holds up his left fist) and here's reason. \nShrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her. \nSHREK Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you and me and our swamp. \nFIONA (HESITANT) It's not going to be just you and me. \nThe ship's fog horn sounds. \nSHIP CAPTAIN All aboard! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 25. \nSHREK It will be. I promise. I love you. \nHe kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat. \nHe title proudly reads: H.R.M CRUSHING RESPONSIBILITY II \nThe boat sets sail.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 27. \nEXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT \nThe boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself. \nShrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door. \nHe breaths heavily, trying to compose himself. \nDONKEY Shrek. Shrek, are you okay? \nSHREK Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father. \nDonkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to the ship's railing. \nSHREK How did this happen? \nPUSS Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him... \nSHREK I know how it happened. I just can't believe it. \nShrek walks away. \nDonkey leans over to Puss. \nDONKEY How does it happen? \nPuss rolls his eyes at Donkey. \nCUT TO: \nDonkey sees Shrek at the back of the boat staring out at the distant horizon.

Puss hops up on the railing and whispers into Shrek's other ear. \nPUSS You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right? (CONFIDENTIALLY) But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing. \nPuss makes a \"let's go fishing\" gesture by casting an imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to whisper in Shrek's other ear. \nDONKEY Man, don't you listen to him. Having a baby is not going to ruin your life. \nSHREK It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's. \nDonkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants. \nSHREK I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase \"as sweet as an...ogre\" or \"as nurturing as...an ogre\" Or how `bout...\"you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre.\" Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32. \nDONKEY Okay, okay I get it!

Sorry. \nThe kid doesn't budge, his arms and legs still sprawled out where he hit the ground. \nTEENAGER (ARTIE) Did you just say you were looking for Arthur? \nShrek, Puss and Donkey turn back around. \nPUSS That information is on a need to know basis. \nDONKEY It's top secret, hushity hush. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something? \nSHREK Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant leprechaun... You made a funny. \nShrek scoops up the Knight, tosses him over his shoulder, ogre-style. \nKNIGHT (LANCELOT) Unhand me, monster! \nSHREK Stop squirming, Arthur. \nKNIGHT (LANCELOT) I'm not Arthur! \nShrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot tries to regain his dignity. \nLANCELOT I am Lancelot. \nLancelot points across the school yard. \nLANCELOT That dork over there is Arthur! \nHe points to the TEENAGE ARTHUR, skulking away across the school yard. \nSHREK Hey! \nArtie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking. \nShrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground. \nLANCELOT Aaah. \nShrek storms off towards the school. Puss and Donkey catch up. One of the female students steps in front of Shrek. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 38. \nGUINEVERRE Ahem!

Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team. \nArtie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified.

Artie studies it. \nARTIE Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest. \nMerlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to change as he stays focused. \nMERLIN Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it! \nARTIE Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone? \nShrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more worked up. \nARTIE It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall! \nSuddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him, stunned. \nMERLIN Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? Really messed up. Whoa. \nMerlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67. \nARTIE Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what? \nDonkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie. Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists. \nSHREK (CLEARS THROAT) Look Artie...um- \nJust as he's about to get going, \"That's What Friends Are For\" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the shack where Merlin peeks out. \nMERLIN (loud, over the music) Just thought I might help set the mood! Y'know for your big heart to heart chat! \nEveryone stares at him. \nHe sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's quiet again. \nSHREK I know what it's like to not feel ready for something. \nArtie looks at him. \nSHREK Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while. \nARTIE I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright? \nShrek takes this in. \nARTIE (CONT'D) Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68. \nSHREK My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either. \nARTIE Well, I doubt he was worse than mine. \nSHREK Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.

Now forgive us, we have a show to put on. \nFIONA Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry. \nHe stops and flashes a sadistic smile. \nPRINCE CHARMING Sorry? Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed? \nPrince Charming leads Rapunzel out. She looks back at them apologetically. Everyone wears a look of defeat. \nThe guards march them off. \nFiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell. Fiona looks through the bars of the cell, feeling helpless. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS OUTSIDE OF FAR FAR AWAY - DAY \nShrek startles awake. He sits up and scratches his head, looking around. He realizes it's morning. \nBehind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch.

He turns back around to wake up everyone. \nThe trees start to advance toward Shrek. \nThe log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground.

Shrek grabs one and throws him to the side. \nMERLIN (CONT'D) Mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing. Mumble, mumble. \nArtie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts to sob. Merlin stops and turns around. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77. \nMERLIN Oh. What, what's with you? \nArtie continues to cry. \nARTIE It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard... \nMerlin is visibly uncomfortable. \nMERLIN C'mon, take it easy. \nArtie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable. \nARTIE No!

There's a mean person doing mean things to good people- \nSHREK Oh, have a heart old man! \nArtie grabs him, now desperate. \nARTIE And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them? \nMERLIN Oh. \nArtie speaks one last, indecipherable line. \nMerlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do. \nMERLIN Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my things. \nMerlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers. Shrek is impressed. \nARTIE Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78. \nSHREK Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham? \nShrek smiles. \nMerlin returns holding a spell book. \nMERLIN Now, I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects. \nDONKEY Side effects!? \nMERLIN Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... I think. \nMerlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey. \nDONKEY Ah! \nMERLIN Oops. \nDonkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look. \nDONKEY Are you sure this is a good idea? \nSHREK Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his- \nMERLIN Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. Let's help our friends get back, um... soon! \nMagic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers.

(GASP) Oh no! \nDonkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch. \nDONKEY (in Puss' body) I've been abracadabra'd into a fancy feasting second rate sidekick. \nPuss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in Puss' body). \nDONKEY (in Puss' body) Aha! \nDonkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek. \nPUSS (in Donkey's body) I had no idea ...really ...I swear. \nShrek quickly dumps the change into the machine.

He's probably getting ready for the SHOWWWW--- \nThe curtain goes down again. \nSHREK Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What show? \nPinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud. \nPUSS (reading the poster) It's A Happily Ever After, After All! \nSHREK Shrek's final performance. \nThe picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the ground. \nDONKEY (in Puss' body) Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play. \nSHREK Well I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 84. \nGUARD #1 (O.S.) It's the ogre! Get him! \nShrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward. \nPUSS (in Donkey's body) Don't worry, Jefe. I got this. \nHe whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're staring at a donkey. \nThe guards recoil. \nGUARD #2 Ugh! Kill it! \nPuss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats. \nArtie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps forward, confronting the guards. \nARTIE Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you? \nShrek picks up on his plan. \nSHREK Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs. \nThe guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the poster off the wall. \nARTIE He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so sorry about this Mr. Shrek. \nSHREK I'm gonna lose it! \nARTIE I assume you have everything ready for tonight! You did get the list for the dressing room? \nDonkey marches in. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 85. \nDONKEY (in Puss' body) Yeah, the breakfast croissants stuffed with seared sashimi tuna. Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with the jalapeno honey butter cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state without his jalapeno honey butter. \nSHREK I just lost it! \nGUARD #1 Uh...Maybe they should talk to Nancy in Human Resources. \nShrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the castle. \nPUSS (in Donkey's body) Oh, we'll have much to say to Nancy, I promise! \nThe guards look at each other nervously. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86. \nWithout looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who falls to the ground. \nPRINCE CHARMING (TO HIMSELF) ) Is that the right word? \"Smote?\" \"Smooote.\" Is that even a word actually? Maybe I should just smite him. \nSHREK You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was. \nARTIE But you said the King asked for me personally. \nSHREK Not exactly. \nARTIE What's that supposed to mean? \nShrek becomes defensive. \nSHREK Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go! \nArtie is stunned. \nARTIE You were playing me the whole time. \nShrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more. \nSHREK You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought. \nPuss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet. \nARTIE You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you - \nPRINCE CHARMING What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90. \nPrince Charming signals the guards to release Artie.

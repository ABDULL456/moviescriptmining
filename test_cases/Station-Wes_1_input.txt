HAVEN You're not that sinister. Last night with the wet towels you were Florence Nightingale in silk stockings. (stretching his legs, looking at her) Have you got a match? 
She comes over with one and lights his pipe. 
HAVEN There's one in my pocket but I hate to reach for it... thanks. 
She takes his hand and looks at the cut knuckle. 
CHARLIE Sit there. 
She walks out of the room and he watches her; then around the room. In a moment she returns, pulls up a chair in the front of him and sits down. She has bandages and a little jar of ointment. 
HAVEN (smiles) Now you're Florence Nightingale again. 
She takes one of his bruised hands, and as she bandages his hands slowly, carefully and rather expertly, they talk. 
CHARLIE Why did you pick that fight? 
HAVEN I thought you did. 
CHARLIE (smiling) Really? 
HAVEN You could have insisted I was your cousin. 
CHARLIE Perhaps that isn't the way I felt about you. 
HAVEN (as his knuckle hurts) Ouch! 
She smiles at him and then goes on. 
HAVEN Where did you get the name of Charlie? 
CHARLIE It was my father's. My name is Charlene, but -- 
He watches her face. 
HAVEN I like that better... Charlene... (she doesn't answer) This'll be the first time I ever worked for a woman. 
CHARLIE (giving him a glance) What makes you think you're going to work for me? 
HAVEN You sent for me. 
CHARLIE (finishing the bandage) How's that? 
She stands up. Haven looks at her and ignores his bandaged hands. 
HAVEN Beautiful. 
CHARLIE (walking towards the window) All right, I sent for you. I was doing a nice quiet business. That was because everybody was afraid of Mick. Now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he'll try to do what you did. 
HAVEN I wouldn't. 
CHARLIE But they will. 
HAVEN That's not the job I want. I don't intend to start at the bottom. I've been there. It's too crowded. 
CHARLIE (coolly) Where do you want to start? 
HAVEN With the money. 
CHARLIE And what will you do for it? 
HAVEN Anything -- except hang. How did you get -- all this? 
CHARLIE I learned one thing from my father. As long as men think they can beat the tables, all you have to do is get a table. Sometimes they run out of cash and I find myself with new responsibilities. 
HAVEN Such as -- 
CHARLIE A couple of stores for one thing. 
HAVEN I can't see myself behind a counter. 
CHARLIE A sawmill, and a logging camp. The logging camp's a long way from town. 
Haven gets the meaning and shakes his head. 
CHARLIE I own the stage line from here to West Rim City, but that's a dud. 
HAVEN Why? 
CHARLIE Outlaws. The money was in gold shipments. Now the mines won't ship it. 
HAVEN I'll take that job. 
CHARLIE You mean ride shot-gun? 
HAVEN I mean run the line.

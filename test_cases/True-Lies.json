{"train": "T R U E   L I E S \nWRITTEN \nBY \nJAMES CAMERON \nTITLE SEQUENCE \n1   EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT \nThe snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs. \n2   EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT \nThe driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal- dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle- eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers. \nThe walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter. \nWith the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a glow pulsing under the ice. \n3   EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nCamera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall. \nSeem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled-glass of the ice above. \n4   EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nA dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing: \nHARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby. \nAfter a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky. \nHARRY Honey, I'm home. \n5   INT. / EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nMeet Harry's partner, ALBERT \"GIB\" GIBSON, an overweight twenty- year-man with a lived in looking face.  Gib answers Harry via his headset. \nGIB Roger that. (he covers the mike and turns) Hey, Fize!  Get your butt in here.  Harry's inside. \nOutside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees. \nFaisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse. \n6   EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nConcealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit. Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER. Very advanced. \nHARRY Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy? \nGIB (OVER) It's Talkradio.  You're on the air. \nHarry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side, containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for the ear-piece slung on the other.  He slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial. \nHarry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back service entrance. \n7   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHarry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place. The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really notice.  He finger-tastes a dish as he passes. \nHARRY (French/ subtitled) This needs more garlic. \nHe breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the-- \n8   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nHere the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid- east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers. \nHarry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in his wake look at each other like \"Do you know him?\"   They shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the crowd.  Scanning. \nHARRY There's Daddy Petrobucks. \nHARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly     * greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a             * conversation. \nThe woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is a frank moment of returned interest.  Then the crowd shifts, cutting off their view of each other. \n9   INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT \nHarry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor.  * He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.     * \n10   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library.  He    * crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.         * \n11   EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT                                           * \nHarry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       * prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        * directly above.  He lets himself into--                          * \n12   INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                     * \nJUNO Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces. \nHARRY I'd like that. \n23   INT. VAN - NIGHT \nGib can't believe this conversation. \nGIB (to Faisil) Son of a bitch is with her two minutes and she's ready to bear his children (to Harry) What's your exit strategy Twinkle Toes? \n24   EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nHarry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through.  He goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court.  Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers his walky talky and starts after him. \nGUARD May I see your invitation, sir? \nWithout turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket.  A REMOTE DETONATOR. \nHARRY                                        * Here's my invitation.                                  * \nHe pushes the button and--                                       * \nKABOOM!  The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion.  Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire. \n25   INT. / EXT. VAN - NIGHT \nGib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.  He starts the van. \nGIB Aw, shit.  Here we go-- \n26   EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT \nHarry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees. Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.  The snow explodes around him with bullet hits. \nTWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid- leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk. \nAs Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement. \n27   EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT \nHarry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway. \nHarry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard station beside the main entrance. \nTRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as-- \nA service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow. \nON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL rifles slung across his back. \nThe helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols zig-zagging among the trees. \nHarry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   * slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly. Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night. \n28   INT. / EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nGIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide. \nINSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on. All he can see are lights and gunfire. \nGIB Harry, what's your twenty?  I need a position, buddy-- \nSuddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly downslope. \nGIB Uh... right!  I'll catch you on the next bend. \nBehind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.  Only about half can make the jump.  The rest crash horribly.  The helicopter thunders overhead. \n29   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT \nHarry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him. \nK-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering. \nFiring from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow. \nHarry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter. \nHarry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope. \n30   INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT \nHarry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail- rotor to steer.  The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain. \nThe copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        * skids.  Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it.  Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.  A snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine. \nGIB (OVER) Harry!  Where are you! \nHARRY In the helicopter. \n31   INT./ EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nGib slides the van around a curve. \nGib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium. \nANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross.  A huge graphic logo covers the floor.  Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR.  In smaller print, around the perimeter, is the motto: \"THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE\". \nThey enter a high-tech office space.  It is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles. There is a hushed quality here.  People do not joke.  They do not hurry.  There are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world.  It looks like a combination of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters. \nFast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned cubicle. \nHARRY Come on, Fize.  We're late for our butt-grinding. \nFaisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them. \n49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nA dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer displays at one end.  Glowering at one end of the long, polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector. Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J.  Edgar Hoover. \nTRILBY Jesus, Harry!  You guys really screwed the pooch last night. Please tell me how I can look at this, that it's not a total pooch- screw. \nHARRY Total is a strong word-- \nGIB There are degrees of totality. \nFAISIL It's a scale really, with \"perfect mission\" on one end and \"total pooch-screw\" on the other and we're more about here-- \nTRILBY Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you? \nFAISIL Yes. \nTRILBY So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?! \nFAISIL Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got. \nHe hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen. \nFAISIL Jamal Khaled.  We think he's dirty so we raid his financial files...  Check it out... \nFaisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid. \nFAISIL One hundred million in wire transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       * INTERNATIONAL--                                        * \nGIB Which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist                      * activities.  Something big is                          * going down -- \nFAISIL                                       * And we know that a week ago four                       * MIRV warheads were smuggled out                        * of the former Soviet Republic of                       * Kazakhstan .  .  . \nHARRY                                        * We think Khaled's group has                            * bought the nukes and is bringing                       * them to U.S.  soil.                                    * \nTRILBY                                       * So far this is not blowing my skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      * anything remotely substantial?                         * Don't be pumping beets up my ass                       * here.  Do you have hard data?                          * \nHARRY                                        * Not what  you'd call rock hard.                        * \nGIB                                          * It's pretty limp, actually.                            * \nTRILBY                                       * Then perhaps you better get some                       * ... before somebody parks a car                        * in front of the White House with a nuclear weapon in the trunk! \n50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nIt is the interior of a huge law office.  Helen works there as a paralegal.  She is going to the break room for coffee with her friend, ALLISON, a secretary.  Allison is black, younger then Helen, and still single. \nHELEN I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. \nALLISON So I guess you didn't get away                         * for the weekend after all?                             * \nHELEN Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town. \nALLISON I'm shocked. \nHELEN Yeah.  You know Harry. \nHelen's nerdy boss BRAD, comes up behind her, scowling. \nBRAD Helen, have you pulled those files yet?  I need them by lunch. \nHELEN I won't let you down, Brad. \nBrad leaves. \nHELEN                                        * (under her breath)                                * You little pencil-neck.                                * (to Allison)                                      * So... yo... sista!  D'you do                           * anything interesting? \nALLISON                                      * Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      * little romantic inn, and...                            * pretty much lapped champagne out of each other's navels for two days. \nHELEN You bitch. \nALLISON Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        * just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.                              * \nHELEN Harry only has two moods: busy...                      * and asleep. \nALLISON Then you better do something to                        * jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion. \nThey both crack up at that one. \n51   INT. OMEGA SECTOR (DATA CENTER) - DAY                            * \nHarry meets up with Gib and Faisil coming from the ANALYSIS      * Department.                                                      * \nHARRY Uh, yes, it is important. \nJuno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP BEEP BEEP!!  Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at it.  The moment is spoiled. \nHARRY Uh, it looks like I have to run. I'll call you tomorrow.  Your proposal is very interesting. \n69   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib lets out a big exhale of relief.  He looks at his watch. \n70   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nHelen and Dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room table.  There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet. The food is getting cold.  Helen looks at her watch. \nDANA See. \n71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nHarry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker      * again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.  Gib keeps checking the rearview. \nGIB We have a friend.  Five cars back, inside lane.  They've been                       * on us since we left Juno's.                            * \nHarry adjusts the passenger side mirror. \nHARRY Station wagon? \nGIB Uh huh.  Want me to lose them? \nHARRY                                        * No.  We need this lead.                                * (into his Rover)                                  * Unit Seven.                                            * \nUNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)                          * Seven here. \nHARRY (into Rover)                                      * I need you at the Georgetown mall                      * in three minutes.                                      * \nSEVEN Copy that.  We're rolling. \nGIB Helen's going to be pissed. \nHARRY See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules. \n72   INT.  STATION WAGON - NIGHT \nThere are three men in the car.  YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the front, with Mahmoud driving.  In the back, shadowed, we can just make out ABU MALIK.  Yusif is massively built, with a body like a beer-keg.  Mahmoud is skinny and intense. \n73   OMITTED                                                          * \n74   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - MALL - NIGHT \nHarry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal. \nHARRY Test two three. (Gib nods, receiving) Pull over here. \nGib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.  Half a block behind them the station wagon does the same.  Harry slips on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car. \n75   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nHarry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.  He coughs slightly. \nGIB (in his ear) You don't smoke, dickhead. \nHarry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of cigarettes casually.  He turns his hand.  The tiny lens in the cigarette pack glints. \nPOV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.  The camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away. \nHARRY strolls into the mall.  It is an open promenade design, with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.  Harry watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the crowd behind him. \nGIB (VO) What's the plan? \nHARRY (apparently mumbling to himself) Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      * Beavis & Butthead.                                     * \n76   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him. \nGIB There's another guy, still in the car. \nHARRY (on radio) Stay on him. \nAll Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.  A soft cherry glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.  No features. \n77   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nHarry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway between shops.  In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they track him through the pedestrian traffic. \n78   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib in on the cellular phone. \nGIB Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry remembered something he left at the office.  You know Harry. \nAs he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the station wagon. \n79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT \nMalik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry coming after him like a juggernaut. \nHe turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street, accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes- lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal. \n87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT \nON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet). \nHARRY Federal Officer in pursuit of suspect!  Sorry. \nHarry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him. \nMALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back, amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs. \nTRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees. Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling. Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it. He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur. \n88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT \nGib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit Seven car pulls out as well, up the block. \nGIB Harry, what's your twenty? \n89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT \nHarry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west. \nHARRY Westbound in the park... suspect is on a motorcycle... he's going to  come out on Franklin.  Hang on-- \nHarry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase. \nHARRY (CONT'D) I want you on 14th in case he turns south.  And I need Seven on the north side to box him in. \n90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a turn. \nGIB Copy that. \nHARRY And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired. \nON GIB, mouthing \"Your horse?\" \n91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT \nMalik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street. Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the horse's hoof cracks the windshield. \n92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT \nUp ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT REGENCY HOTEL. \nBellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them. The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby. \nHARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him. \n93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nAcres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women. And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the steps going up to the RESTAURANT. \nHarry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after Malik. \n94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMalik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier. Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way. \n95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nMALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees-- the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He guns it and slides through the doors. \nHARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of Malik as the doors close. \n96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nHarry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be-- \nA GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on Harry's retinas. \nThe older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator. The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall. \nHARRY Can you just press the top floor, please. \nThe man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off, rising after Malik's. \n97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nGib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of the porters. \nGIB The guy on the horse?! \nThe porter points at the elevators. \n98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT \nCUT TO: \n102   EXT. STREET/ NEAR HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY \nIt is the following morning.  Harry and Gib are staked out watching the front of Dana's school.  Actually, Harry is staked out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars. \nGib just keeps looking at his watch.  He picks up a cellular phone and pretends to call the office. \nGIB Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch -- \nHARRY (not listening) Okay.  Here she comes. \n103   EXT. STREET - DAY \nHARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.  She gets on behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he launches out into traffic. \n104   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY \nHarry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her.  Trent weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between the cars. \nHARRY Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once. \nGIB Goddammit!  That's outrageous. \nHarry speeds up.  Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay with Trent. \n105   EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY \nON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following her.  She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her \nDANA Oh my God!  I think that's my dad! \nTRENT Hang on! \nTrent downshifts and punches it.  The nimble little bike screams as it zips between cars. \n106   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY \nHARRY (clenching his jaw) So, you wanna play huh?  You little-- \nGIB (rolling his eyes) That's it.  Get 'im Harry (he draws a pistol) We'll teach that little puke not to signal. \n107   EXT. MOTORCYCLE \nBACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.  He zig-zags through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where Gib and Harry get blocked.  He cuts a sharp right turn and disappears. \n108   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY \nHarry is stuck in stopped traffic.  He pounds the wheel in frustration. \nGIB (exploding with laughter) Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny. \nHARRY Son of a bitch! \nGIB Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy? \nCUT TO: \n109   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / I.D. ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY \nHarry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor screen.  Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through HEADSHOTS of known terrorists.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Harry is very focussed.  He stops.  He goes back one.  Studies the face. \n110   INT. ANALYSIS ROOM - TIGHT ON THE SCREEN - DAY \nA defiant looking Syrian with a full beard. \nHARRY holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating on the eyes. \nHARRY That's him. \n111   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nHarry slaps photos down in front of Trilby. \nHARRY Abu Kaleem Malik. \nGIB (reading from a file) Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     * fundamentalist.  Linked to                             * numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       * bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.                       * \nFAISIL                                       * Now he's formed his own splinter faction called CRIMSON JIHAD. \nGIB                                          * Guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste. \nFAISIL They call him \"The Sand Spider\".                       * \nTRILBY Why? \nFAISIL (he shrugs) Probably because it sounds scary.                      * \nTRILBY This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was. \nHARRY We'll get him. \nTRILBY Yes.  You will. (meaning-- you damn well better) Harry, I still want you in charge, even though your cover is blown.  Just keep a low profile. (he slaps a newspaper on the table) I generally prefer it when my covert operations don't make the front page. \nGIB What'dya expect Harry?  She's a flesh and blood woman.  And you're never there.  It was only a matter of time. \nHarry sags.  His friend is right.  Gib opens the car door and helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time-- \nGIB I say we concentrate on work. That's how I always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit.  Let's catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them.  You'll feel better. \nGib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry. \nGIB Women.  Can't live with 'em. Can't kill 'em. \n118   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY \nHarry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM.  Banks of tape-decks recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and collating transcripts. \nGIB He's giving us a blank check on                        * wiretaps.  So I've set 'em up on all of Juno's shipping agents, her clients, and Faisil made up                        * a list of possible contacts that Crimson Jihad might have in this country.  Now all we can do is                         * wait --                                                * \nHe notices Harry is not listening. \nGIB Is this national security stuff boring you? \nHARRY Put a tap on her phone. \nGIB What're you talking about?  We have that. \nHARRY Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house. \nGib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously. He pulls him into an empty office. \nGIB                                          * (a whispered hiss)                                * Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        * describe that idea.  In.  Sane. Unauthorized wiretap is a felony, pard. \nHarry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth clenched. \nHARRY Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now. \nGIB Sure, Harry.  I'm on it. \nHarry releases him and turns away.  Gib straightens his jacket, looking at his friend like he's completely losing it. \n119   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThat night Harry is actually there on time for dinner.  He glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily.  She looks at her peas. \nHARRY How was school today? \nDANA Fine. \nHarry takes a bite of his food, watching her.  Silence.  Helen glances at him. \nHELEN So.  You came by to see me today? \nShe is a too casual, masking her nervousness. \nHARRY I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch. \nHELEN They must've just missed me. \nHARRY They said you had to run out. \nHELEN Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it. \nHarry watches her lying to him with some amazement.  You can see the jaw muscles clenching. \nHARRY So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay? \nHELEN Oh, sure.  Fine. (she gets up suddenly) I'll get some more gravy. \nDANA I'm done. \nDana bolts.  She has eaten about four bites.  Harry sits at the table, alone.  He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is lying to everybody else.  He is a man without a center, lost. \nCUT TO: \n120   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY \nTRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS.  Harry comes to a particular set of machines.  He reaches past the technician and picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts. \nON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts. Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head slowly.  Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID: \nHELEN Hello? \nSIMON Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk? \nHELEN Yes.  Go ahead. \n121   INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY \nA man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY), speaks into a cellular phone.  This is SIMON.  He is dark haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way.  He is unshaven and his clothes look slept in.  He glances around in a furtive manner. \nSIMON I can't talk long.  Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow?  I must see you. \n122   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nNOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office. \nSIMON Cairo was a day at the beach next                      * to this. \n138   INT. SEDAN - DAY \nHarry and Gib turn to each other, shocked with the dawning awareness. \nGIB Guy's a spook! \nHARRY Yeah, but for who?                                     * \nGIB He could be working her to get to you. \nHarry waves his hand, silencing Gib. \nINTERCUT FROM HERE ON BETWEEN HARRY/GIB AND HELEN/SIMON. \n139   INT. CAFE - DAY \nSIMON puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen. \nSIMON Did you read the papers yesterday? \nHELEN Yes. \nSIMON Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running                          * shootout, ending at the                                * Marriot... \n140   INT. SEDAN - DAY \nHARRY AND GIB react, realizing that it is the story of their operation gone awry. \n141   INT. CAFE - DAY \nHELEN That was you?! \nSIMON You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this. \n142   INT. SEDAN - DAY \nHarry starts to get it.  Then is dawns on Gib. \nGIB The guy's a fake!  He's taking credit for our moves. \n143   INT. CAFE - DAY \nHELEN LEANS CLOSE TO SIMON.  She clearly is hanging on his every word. \nHELEN Tell me what happened? \nSIMON I'm sorry, I can't. \nHELEN You can trust me completely. \nSIMON I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things. \nHELEN Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night. \nSIMON It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins. \n144   INT. SEDAN - DAY \nHARRY REACTS to the outrageous fabrication. \nGIB Unbelievable. \n145   INT. CAFE - DAY \nBUT HELEN is eating it up. \nHELEN Were they trying to kill you?                          * \nSIMON Three of them.  Hardly worth                           * talking about.  Two won't bother                       * me again. \nHELEN And you chased one? \nSIMON Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the                       * risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of                         * times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  . \nHELEN                                        * You can't?                                             * \nSIMON                                        * No.  It's the training.  It                            * shapes you into a lethal                               * instrument.  You react without                         * thinking.                                              * \n146   INT. SEDAN - DAY \nHARRY AND GIB guffaw.  This is too much. \nGIB                                          * I'm starting to like this guy.                         * \nHarry shoot him a hard look.                                     * \nGIB                                          * (holding up his hand                              * defensively)                                     * We still have to kill him, that's                      * a given.                                               * \n147   INT. CAFE - DAY \nBACK TO HELEN AND SIMON as she leans even closer. \nHARRY (grinning) Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me. \nSimon leans forward, conspiratorially. \nSIMON Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them. \nHARRY So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it. \nSIMON Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours. \nHARRY Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run? \nSIMON Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios. \nHARRY Use 'em and lose 'em. \nSIMON Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower. \nHARRY What about the husbands? \nSIMON Dickless.  If they took care of                        * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean? \nHARRY Those idiots. \n163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY \nThey are cruising along, with Harry driving this time. \nHARRY You working on someone right now? \nSIMON I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great. \nUnconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter. \nHARRY What does she do? \nSIMON Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk. \nHarry takes a corner too fast.  The tires squealing. \nSIMON And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be.  She's like a dying plant that just needs a little water. \nWhen Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...  they laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake- eyed.  He could kill Simon with one punch.  He's visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy. \nHARRY But with you, she gets to be hot, right? \nSIMON Red hot.  Her thighs steam. \nThey laugh together.  Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle. He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.  Now for the big question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY? \nHARRY Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then? \nSIMON (yelling suddenly) Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn! \n164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY \nHarry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.  He cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger-180.  It screeches backward, sliding right into its parking space perfectly. \nSimon is bugeyed.  But he is non-plussed for only about two seconds.  Then he's back to selling.  He scrambles out and goes around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke. \nSIMON See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork? \nHARRY Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me? \nSimon grins and winks. \nSIMON Because it's you. \n165   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nDana is in the living room, watching TV when she sees her mother cross through, dressed to go out. \nHELEN Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late. \nDANA Where are you going? \nHELEN Out. \nDana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles. \n166   INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT \nON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror.  She looks at her big dowdy purse.  Hating it suddenly.  She pulls her pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet for a small handbag, then charges out. \n167   OMITTED \n168   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT \nHarry is driving.  Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his briefcase and hands them to him. \nGIB Here's today's transcripts. There's nothing interesting. \nSIMON Nothing from Simon? \nGIB That's not what it looked like when we found you. \nHarry scowls at Gib in the dark.  Helen flushes, remembering. \nHARRY How did you meet him? \nFLASHBACK SEQUENCE: \n202   INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK \nWe see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works, having a cappucino and a croissant. \nHELEN (V.O.) About two weeks ago I was at the mall, having coffee... \nSimon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her.  He approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat next to her.  His manner is furtive.  He keeps looking around, as if for hidden assasins.  He hands her a briefcase. \nSIMON (speaking very low) Keep this for me.  I can't afford to be taken with it.  National security is at stake.  I'll contact you if a can.  Okay?  Oh-- \nHe seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off the other way. \n203   EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK \nHelen walks back to her office building, carrying the briefcase.  She keeps looking over her shoulder. \n204   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK \nShe has the briefcase on her desk while she works.  She keeps glancing at it as she types.  Finally she hunches over it and starts picking the locks with a paper clip. \nTIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open. \nON HELEN as she opens the case.  She gasps. \nINSIDE THE CASE are the following items:  A tiny camera, some loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K.  PISTOL.  Helen, eyes wide, closes the case. \n205   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT \nHelen shrugs, finishing up her story. \nHELEN I should have gone to the police, I suppose. \nGIB But you didn't.  Why not? \nHELEN I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen. \nHARRY What did happen? \nHELEN Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. \n206   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - SUNSET/FLASHBACK \nThrough the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to Georgetown and Embassy Row.  Helen is sitting on a park bench when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.  She hands him the briefcase. \nSIMON Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name? \nHELEN Helen. \nSIMON You can call me Simon. (he touches her hand) You're very brave to do this... (then notices the locks have been opened) You opened it. \nHELEN I just glances inside. \n207   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - CLOSE UP ON SIMON \nCLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes. \nSIMON (solemn) Then you know. \n208   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT \nHarry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole thing. \nHARRY Why did you continue to see him? \nHELEN He needed my help. \nHARRY Not because you were attracted to him? \nHELEN No. \nHARRY You weren't attracted to him at all? \nHELEN Well, maybe a little. \nGIB Is this a common thing for you? Cheating? \nHELEN No!  Never! \nGIB So, it was your first time. \nHELEN I wasn't cheating! \nHARRY Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker. \nHELEN Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company. \nGIB Now what? \nHARRY (leaning forward to the mike) There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us. \nGIB (whispering to Harry) Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing? \nHARRY (like: isn't it obvious?) I'm giving her an assignment. (to Helen) I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed. \nHELEN Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see-- \nHARRY Yes or no. \nHELEN What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved? \nHARRY You will be contacted with the assignment. \nHELEN My husband can't know about this. \nHARRY No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that? \nHELEN I think so. \nHARRY Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most. \nHELEN (fearless) I can do it! \nHARRY The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be-- \nHELEN (excited) Natasha? \nHARRY No.  Doris. \n211   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nON HELEN, not liking her wimpy code-name. \n212   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT \nThe unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.  The door slides open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.  She is wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands. She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off.  She watches it drive off into the night. \n213   EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT \nThe van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.  The door opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.  Gib follows as Harry guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.  Harry whips off the hood and Simon takes in his surroundings. \nSIMON Yeeaoowww!! \nHARRY You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos? \nSIMON Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your-- \nHarry whips off his ski-mask. \nSIMON -- face.  Shit!  Shit!! \nSimon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.  Then it dawns...  He looks up, brightening hopefully. \nSIMON It's you!  Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all? \nGIB You can drop it now, Carlos.  The game is over.  Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented. \nSIMON No... I sell cars.  That's all! Not even foreign cars.  Nothing international, I swear.  I'm no terrorist.  Everything I said was a lie... you have to believe me. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever even saw a gun I'd-- \nHarry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes. \nSIMON -- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me. I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm navel lint.  I have to lie to women to get laid.  And I don't score much.  It's pathetic. (he looks down) See, look... would a spy pee himself? \nHarry is finally sickened by his grovelling.  He pulls Simon away from the edge, then gestures with his gun. \nHARRY Beat it. \nSIMON No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me. \nHarry starts back to the truck.  Simon stays right with him, facing him, terrified to turn away.  Like a dog following him. \nSIMON Please don't.  You can have the car for free-- \nGIB Take off, dipshit! \nGib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance backward.  The two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust.  Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles from nowhere. \nCUT TO: \n214   INT./ EXT. SEDAN - DAY \nTIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city streets.  Gib drives while Harry watches the screen. \nHARRY We should pick up visual at the next light. \nThe scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.  He picks it up. \nHARRY Morning, boss. \n215   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - DAY \nDANA Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history. \n223   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe image of a family dinner.  Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes. Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile.  Then she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the kitchen. \nDANA I'm done. \nHELEN Where are you off to young lady? \nDANA (pointing toward her room) I have a book report. \nHelen watches her go.  That's strange. \nHARRY So last night was pretty exciting, huh? \nHELEN (alarmed) What? (then smoothly--) Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there. \nHarry smiles, reaching for more chicken.  The phone RINGS. Helen controls the urge to run to it. \nHELEN Hello? \nMETALLIC VOICE Doris? \nHELEN Oh.  Yes? \n224   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT \nGIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise his voice. \nGIB Listen carefully.  Go to the Hotel Marquis in one hour.  Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk.  And dress sexy. \n225   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nBACK ON HELEN as she reacts to that. \nHELEN What? \nVOICE Get going! (CLICK) \nHELEN (thinking for a second, then--) Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye. \nHarry smirks, listening to her lie.  She's good.  The smirk drops as she turns. \nHELEN Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey. \nHARRY Sure, hon. \nShe walks unhurriedly out of the room.  Behind her back, Harry is grinning.  The second Helen is out of his sight line, she runs up the stairs.  Harry waits a moment then picks up the phone. \n226   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT \nGib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING.  The phone in his briefcase rings. Gib answers. \nGIB You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis. \nHARRY Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?                               * \nGib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby.  In it a FAT   * FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand-  * written page. \nGIB Not quite. \n227   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT \nWe hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder.   * He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent.  Close your eyes    * and he's Charles Boyer. \nJEAN-CLAUDE                                  * No no.  Do it slowly.  Very slowly. \n228   OMITTED                                                          * \n229   INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT \nA big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby.  Helen enters, looking different than we have ever seen her.  She has been commanded to be sexy, and she is.  Her black slinky dress is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been aware of.  She's pulled her hair back and added pearls.  Now she looks elegant and hot.  Playing the role. \n230   INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT \nShe goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER with her eyes.  He comes over to her. \nHELEN Do you have an envelope for Doris? \nThe man nods.  Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and hands her the envelope.  She opens it as she walks across the lobby.  In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a phone number. \n231   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number.  She scans the lobby as the phone rings-- \nMETALLIC VOICE Listen.  You are a prostitute named Michelle.  Go to the room. A man will be there.  He is a suspected arms dealer. \nHELEN Do I have to... you know-- ? \nVOICE No.  He has particular tastes. He likes to watch.  You will say his regular girl, Carla, is sick. If he likes you, he will tell you what to do.  You must plant the bug near the telephone, by the bed, before you leave.  If you do not accomplish your mission, the deal is off. \n232   INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT \nThe door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs. \nHELEN Listen, you don't need him, he's nothing.  He's a sales rep for a computer company, really-- \nThe thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up. \nHELEN That was unnecessary. \n236   INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT                                      * \nA stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   * through the basement labyrinth.                                  * \nHELEN What were you doing there? \nHARRY You wouldn't believe me. \nA pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear. \nTERRORIST LEADER Talk again, I kill you. \nThey are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting   * with the door open.  A fourth terrorist slides the van door      * shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel.  The van    * takes off. \nCUT TO:              * \n237   OMITTED                                                          * \n238   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a private hanger.  The van doors open and the hostages are brought out.  Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind the van.  The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to open the passenger door.  A slender pair of ankles emerge, followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister. \nTo Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed to kill, approaching them. \nJUNO (with a wry smile) Hello, Harry. \nHARRY Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again. \nHELEN You know her? \nJuno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the prisoners toward the plane. \nJUNO Who's your little friend? \nHELEN I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are? \nJUNO (to Harry) So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist? \n239   INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT \nThey enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane.  Helen has never seen anything like this. \nHELEN Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. \nJUNO No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night. \nHELEN No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- \nHARRY Look, Juno, this is just some whacko hooker I met in the bar. \nAKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats and strap them in. \nHELEN Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter-- \nHARRY (looking at Helen contemptuously) I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business. \nHELEN Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this? \nHelen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck, and opens it to show Juno. \nTHE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling. \nHarry roles his eyes.  Great, Helen.  A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up carrying a tray.  Juno smiles graciously at Helen. \nJUNO Something before take-off? \nThe hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps Helen in the shoulder. \nHELEN Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii-- \nShe slumps.  Juno looks at Harry. \nJUNO She was telling the truth, wasn't she Harry?  She really doesn't know.  Interesting. \nJuno nods and the hostess zaps Harry.  He slides into unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM. \n240   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south. \n241   EXT. PIER - NIGHT \nA small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.  Next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building, two stories high.  There are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms. It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the Caribbean. \nThere is a lot of activity.  Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.  About thirty men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various activities.  Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles. \nPILOT Miami TCA, we are on final. \nGIB Call our DEA contact, tell him I want those choppers flight-ready the second we land. \n244   INT. WAREHOUSE - NO NAME KEY - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON BLACK AND WHITE VIEWFINDER IMAGE of the terrorists' handycam.  Harry is speaking directly into the camera, finishing up his message. \nHARRY ...and I can verify that they have the arming box and all                            * equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads.  This is absolutely the real thing, gentlemen. \nThe camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs. \nMALIK You have killed our women and                          * children, bombed our cities from afar like cowards, and dare to call us terrorists-- \nOver the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash. \nCUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by one of his men.  The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he should interrupt.  He gulps nervously as Malik drones on. \nMALIK -- But now the Oppressed have                          * been given a mighty sword, to                          * strike back at their enemies.                          * Unless the US pulls all military forces out of the Persian Gulf area, immediately and forever, Crimson Jihad will rain fire on one major US city each week until these demands are met... \nBACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE.  BATTERY warning flashing faster. \nMALIK ... First one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of Crimson Jihad's power and our willingness to be humanitarian. However, if there demands are not-- \nIn a burst of static the image GOES BLACK. \nThe cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced. Malik's eyes are black with murder. \nCAMERAMAN Battery, Abu. \nMALIK Get another one, you moron! \n245   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT \nA filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse). A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no glass in the windows.  Harry and Helen are brought in by two TERRORIST GUARDS.  Juno follows then into the bleak room. Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs. \nA MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase.  He has skull- like features.  He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills, Dremel tools with saw blades. \nJUNO This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty. \nHARRY Oral hygiene? \nJUNO Not exactly. \nHELEN (scared) What's going on, Harry? \nJUNO Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist. \nSAMIR (holding up a syringe) This will help. \nSamir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe. \nHARRY You know, you should swab that with alcohol.  I might get an infection. \nSAMIR                                        * I'll return when this has taken                        * effect.  Then we'll talk.                              * \nHARRY                                        * I'm looking forward to it.                             * \nSamir exits.                                                     * \nHARRY                                        * Why are you helping these raving psychotics. \nJUNO Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and I'm getting a lot of money. \nShe kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg. \nJUNO You think I care about their                           * cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         * See, America is on top now .  .                        * .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         * civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living                          * well takes money.                                      * \nHARRY You're damaged goods, lady. \nHarry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred.  The drugs are taking effect. \nJUNO (indicating Helen) Did you tell her about us, Harry? \nHARRY There is no us, you psychotic bitch. \nJUNO Sure.  Say that now. \nJuno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately.  She breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect.  Helen is trembling with rage. \nJUNO Thanks for everything, Harry.  It was good while it lasted. \nJuno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his belt.  Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees. She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin. \nJUNO Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine. \nHELEN Something you obviously have a hard time doing! \nJUNO Hold that thought. \nJuno leaves.  Harry looks dopily at Helen. \nHARRY There was nothing.  I swear. \nHELEN As much as you used to? \nHARRY No. (she deflates) Much more. \nShe looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth. \nHELEN                                        * (grinning)                                        * It wore off. \nAt that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block building. \nHARRY They found the bodies.  Come on-- \n249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT \nHarry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS, running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     * with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               * \nAs the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  * the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      * away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      * first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner. Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two- hand neck-breaker-- SNAP. \nTwo more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  * foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    * flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     * .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   * out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   * expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             * \nHELEN I married Rambo.                                       * \nHe grabs her and kisses her passionately. \nHARRY Let's go. thru   OMITTED                                                          * \n254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nLOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it. \nA GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband.  It is all surreal. \nBELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY. Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for Helen. \nHARRY In ninety minutes a pillar of                          * holy fire will rise at this place                      * as a sign to out enemies.                              * (Malik theatrically turns the arming key) It is done... \nMalik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting again. \nHARRY Now no man can stop us.  We are set on our course.  No force can stop us... (as libbing) ... we're cool, we're badass, blah blah. \n255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT \nMalik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans. The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building. \nMalik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside. \n256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT \nHELEN If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? \nHARRY We must be in the Florida Keys .                       * .  .  the Overseas Highway                             * connects the islands to the mainland. \nHELEN                                        * So there's no border, no customs.                      * They can just drive anywhere they                      * want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       * stop them .  .  . \nHARRY Just us. \nHELEN What are you going to do? \nHARRY (shrugs, like: what do you think?) Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. \nHe hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily. \nHELEN Oh shit. \nHARRY Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay? \nShe nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below. \n257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT \nON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him, shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him, with guns raised. \nHARRY (to Helen) SHOOT!! \n258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT \nHELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one! But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the gun \nFLIES OUT OF HER HANDS. It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM! The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another terrorist is splattered. \nIt spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!! \nShe has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her. \n259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT \nA TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry-- Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door-- \n260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \n--landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is-- \n261   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A FORKLIFT - NIGHT \n275   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY \nHARRY AND GIB are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area. \nGIB ... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah-- \nHARRY Here they come. \nGib looks out the window in time to see-- \nTHREE hunch-winged P.S.T.O.L.  HARRIER jets pass them at 600 knots. \nHARRY (to the pilots) Roger, Mike Three Five, you are cleared to engage.  Be advised, your targets have Stingers and light machine guns. \n276   INT. COCKPIT OF LEAD HARRIER - DAY \nThe pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm. \nPILOT Copy that, Bright Boy command. (to his wingman) Tally ho. \n277   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack run, and scramble to get out their Stingers. \nThe Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the trucks below.  The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of the causeway into plumes of spray. \n278   EXT. HIGHWAY - ON TRUCK - DAY \nOne of the Bomb trucks is hit.  It explodes and flies off the    * bridge into the water.  The terrorists on one of the other trucks fire a Stinger missile. \n279   EXT. ABOVE HIGHWAY - ON HARRIER - DAY \nIt arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.  The pilot ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes. \n280   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY \nHarry sees the battle far ahead... the exploding jet. \nHARRY (to the pilots) Recommend you use your Mavericks                       * to take out the bridge.                                * \nPILOT (OVER) They won't set off those nukes will they? \nHARRY Negative, Mike Three Five. That's a negative. (low, to Gib) Probably not. \n281   EXT. HIGHWAY/ OCEAN - DAY \nThe two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    * Maverick missiles at the bridge.                                 * \n282   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    * .  .  .  K-BOOOOM!!  A whole section of the concrete span        * collapses into the water. \n283   EXT. HIGHWAY - TRUCKS - DAY \nThe first truck is consumed in the blast.  The last truck        * slides to the edge of the gap and stops.                         * \n284   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY \nJuno is trying to see what's going on ahead.  All they can see is smoke and explosions.  Akbar is speaking heatedly (in Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer. \nHelen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward, grabbing the gun.  Juno fires wildly as they struggle for control of the weapon.  The sound is deafening in the tiny space.  The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he slumps forward.  His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal and the car surges faster. \n285   EXT. HIGHWAY/ BATTLE SITE - DAY \nThe third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the           * remaining truck into tinfoil.  Battle over.  Two bombs down. \n286   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY \nThe columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles ahead of the copter. \nHARRY Good shooting, Mike Three Five. I need you to stay on station. (to the copter pilot)                             * Okay.  You see that limo? \n287   INT./ EXT. LIMO - HIGHWAY - DAY                                  * \nTHE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it hits.  In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out- of-control-train. \n288   INT. LIMO - DAY \nINSIDE, Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open sunroof and the pistol goes flying out. \nHELEN You... bitch!! \nHelen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against anything hard she can find inside the car.  Suddenly she stops, looking out the front window.  Juno turns too, off her look, to see-- ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  The causeway is blown away about a quarter mile ahead. \nJUNO Shit! \nJuno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on the dead driver.  The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement. Helen look up through the sunroof and sees-- \n289   EXT. ABOVE LIMO - DAY \nTHE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.  Harry is climbing out onto the skids.  He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and hangs down as low as he can.  HELEN stands up in the opening and waves her arms. \n290   INT. / EXT. BELL COPTER/ LIMO - DAY \nHarry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just has his walky on his belt. \nINSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to FULL. \nGIB (to pilot) It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops, cross-training and all that. \nAGENT Harry can fly anything. \nThe big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee. \nGIB He's a little rusty.  It's like riding a bicycle .  .  .  you never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd seek shelter! \nIt drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way. At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180. \nGIB He's got it. \nHARRY Sorry. \nHarry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward. \n300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY \nGib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky... \nHARRY Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell her I love her.  And ask the pilot where the button for the 20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I found it. \nThe plane disappears toward Miami. \n301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY \nAN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons. \n302   EXT. STREET - DAY \nANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter two blocks away. \n303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY \nINSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance. \n304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY \nMalik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor, still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go? \nShe watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key. He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video- tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying but she is fairly composed now. \nDANA I have to go to the bathroom. \nThe terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily setting up to shoot Malik. CAMERAMAN Tape is rolling. \nMALIK This is a communique from Crimson Jihad.  You have heard from your own expert.  You have seen the Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do not force us to destroy this city.  And do not try to use force against us.  I can trigger this bomb instantly.  All I have to do is turn that key... (he points fiercely at the bomb) ... and five million of your people will die. \nThe reporter glances down, nervously. \nREPORTER What key? \nMALIK (pointing like the guy's blind) That key right there! \nMalik looks down.  The key is gone. \nMALIK (to his men) Someone has stolen the key! \nHe turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs after her. \n305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY \nON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees-- Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He signals to his men not to fire. \nDANA (terrified, but thinking) You shoot me, this'll fall. \nMalik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof. Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest. \nDANA Don't come any closer.  I'll drop it!  I swear to God. \nMALIK If you drop it, I will have no reason not to kill you. \nHe advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along the edge. \nMALIK Come on, child.  Give me the key. (smiling) Don't you want to live?  I give you my word. \nDANA No way you whacko. \nShe reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. \nMalik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It is windy and the boom is swinging. \n306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY \nThe Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar and look toward the window. \n307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY \nRISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER. It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon. \n", "test1_input": "38   INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY \nHarry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            * incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the      * other way. \nHARRY Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!                      * \nHarry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself.  We get our first good look at Helen.  She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit.  Her hair is wrapped in a towel.  To call her plain would be inaccurate.  She could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her. \nHARRY I'm late. \nHELEN Me too. \nThey talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do. \nHELEN How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous? \nHARRY Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount... \nShe is already tuning him out.  And it hits us:  SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES. \nHELEN (barely listening) That's fabulous Harry. \nHARRY Yeah, it was wild. \nHarry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth. He smiles.  The best lies are told with enthusiasm. \n39   INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives there.  He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy Orbison impression.  Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib gives him the evil eye. \nGIB Come any closer I'll kill you. \nThe dog backs up, whining plaintively.  Gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece.  He adjusts its position carefully.  Hmmmm. \n40   INT. BATHROOM - DAY \nHarry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly.  She is doing her make-up. \nHELEN The plumber came yesterday.  He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix. \nHarry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in front of the mirror.  His mind is elsewhere.  He couldn't care less about there domestic problems. \nHARRY Uh huh.  Okay. \nHELEN It's not okay.  It's extortion. \nHARRY What did you tell him? \nHELEN I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. \nHARRY Good thinking, honey. \nHarry kisses her on the cheek and exits. \n41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY \nGib enters and pours two cups of coffee.  Dana is drinking orange juice from the bottle at the fridge. \nGIB Hi, kid. \nDANA Hey, Gib.  What up? \nShe EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart.  Harry comes in a second later and Gib hands him his coffee. \nHARRY Thanks dear. \nGIB Here, check these out. \nGib hands Harry the glasses.  Harry studies them, seeing the VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans. Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking, then he puts them on. \nHARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video image of his own living room. \nGIB The CCD camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes. Slick little unit, huh? \nIN POV we see Dana enter the living room.  She looks around carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his wallet.  She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts the wallet back.  Pro moves. \nHARRY Son of a bitch! \nGIB What? \nHarry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen. Gib goes after him. \n42   EXT. HOUSE - DAY \nDana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the driveway on his idling YAMAHA.  Trent is 16, dressed in grunge- rock style, trying to look tough.  Harry comes out the front door as Trent revs the motor. \nHARRY Dana!! \nShe waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch and they shoot down the driveway. \nDANA (yelling over the engine) Can't stop, I'm late.  Bye, Dad! \n43   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY \n", "test1_true": "GIB Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery. \nHARRY She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that. \nGIB Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo. \nGib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward Lafayette Square.  Capital Hill is behind them. \n44   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DAY                                        * \nHarry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor.         * Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads    * TEKTEL SYSTEMS.

She's only fourteen. \nThey go into a corridor.                                         * \nGIB Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.

De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion. \nHARRY Will you just open the door!                           * \nGib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the    * doorknob.  There is the CLUNK of a SOLENOID LOCK.                * \nGIB Or drugs. \n45   OMITTED                                                          * \n46   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nThey enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for      * video surveillance cameras.  They walk along the silence for a   * moment, then .  .  .                                             * \nGIB Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it. \nHARRY I thought you moved out. \nGIB Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks. \nThey approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window    * in it.  Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at a desk... and nothing else.  Gib presses a buzzer. \n47   INT. OUTER SECURITY ROOM - DAY \nJANICE sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist... but she is a highly trained security specialist.  She is also hefty through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly humorless.  She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand outside the door.  Harry and Gib appear as living X-Ray images. Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses.  Janice puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a holster riveted beneath her desk.  She buzzes Harry and Gib in with the other. \nJANICE Gentlemen, please idenitify yourselves to the scanner. \nHarry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint- voice scanners.  Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the retinal scanner. \nHARRY Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four. \nGIB Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one. \nTheir clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk. \nJANICE Thank you.  You are cleared. \nShe stands to give them plastic I.D.  badges which they hang around their necks. \nGIB Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in? \nJANICE Ten, Mr. Gibson. \nGIB And you still reach for your piece every time. \nJANICE Yes sir. \nGIB God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice. \nJANICE Yes, sir. \nHe kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by.  She does not react is any discernible way. \nThey pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens automatically.  Beyond is a kind of airlock... a SALLY PORT. Behind a lexan shield are TWO GUARDS armed with MP5s.  They nod but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them. \nHARRY You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment. \nGIB In her dreams. \n48   INT. OMEGA SECTOR INNER SANCTUM - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2106, "test2_input": "There is definitely unholy magnetism here.  She indicates for Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices.  There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls. \nJUNO So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters? \nHARRY That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see. \nJuno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area. There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates.  An overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces.  There are massive columns, and statues two stories high.  Even the entire facade of a tomb. \nJUNO So what did these... people... say about me exactly? \nThey stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment.  Most of the workers are middle-eastern. \nHARRY Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. \nJUNO Those wimps.  It's because I use                       * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. (yelling in Arabic to two workmen) I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. \nWe realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from nearby.  He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid- thirties. \nJUNO You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of                          * Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Not the most popular places lately.  So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy. \nJuno stops and looks at Harry.  Her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business. \nJUNO Well, do you see anything you like, Mr. Renquist? \nCUT TO: \n57   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY \nHarry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS HOTEL.  It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the city.  Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an electronic DETECTOR. \nHARRY She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east. \nGIB She could be moving money, guns. Anything. \nFAISIL And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the                           * ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front. \nHARRY Okay.

Can I speak to you for a moment please, in your office? \nHis manner is self-effacing.  Humble.  He doesn't meet her gaze.  She nods and they go into the private office. \n59   INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY \nMALIK comes in behind her and closes the door.  The moment they are away from public observation, his manner changes.  His humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he approaches her.  Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE. \nMALIK You stupid undisciplined bitch! \nHer jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive. \nJUNO It's a good thing you pay me well. \nMALIK Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a-- \nJUNO No.  He checked out okay-- \nMalik slaps her again. \nMALIK That is for interrupting.

She runs her fingers slowly across the figures.  It is strange and erotic. \nJUNO They breathed and loved and wept, just like us.

It follows the Vette. \nCONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO) This is Condor.  We have the ball, repeat... we have a good lock-up on I.R. \nCUT TO: INFRARED VIEW of the Vette, from the helicopter's FLIR system.  The greenish, image-intensified view of the car is like daylight. \n185   OMITTED \nPAGES 79 - 80 OMITTED \nEXT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT                          186 \nDown past the helicopter, to the Vette on the highway below as they head out into the country. \nOMITTED (187)                                                  187 \nEXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                      188 \nThe headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the highway.  Simon and Helen get out of the car. \nSIMON My place in the city is too hot right now.  So is the penthouse in New York.  But this place is secure. \nHe takes her inside. \nOMITTED (189)                                                  189 \nINT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                   190 \nHelen feels awkward in the small, junky space.  A tape deck is playing cool jazz.  Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine. He clinks her glass with his. \nSIMON To our assignment. \nHELEN What is it you need me to do? \nSIMON Helen, I want you to be my wife. \nHELEN I'm married! \nSIMON (quickly) Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone. \nHELEN We're going to Paris? \nSIMON Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days. \nHELEN I don't know.  I have to think... \nSIMON Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable. \nHe clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and magazines out of the way.  She sits down and he tops off her glass from the wine bottle. \n191   EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT \nThe agents have gathered behind a billboard.  Harry, Gib and     * the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.  They finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       * masks.  They don them in perfect unison.  Commando precision. Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard, closing in on Simon's trailer. \n", "test3_true": "Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly. \nHELEN Okay.  I'll do it. \nSimon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand. \nSIMON You are incredibly brave.  I have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling.  I've lived like this for years, so I'm used to it.  Every day when I get up, I think it might be my last.  But it makes you appreciate life. And the moment.  Because that may be all you have. \nHe moves a little closer.  Casting his spell. \nSIMON To pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other.  The enemy can spot a fake easily. \nHe puts his hand on her knee.  She tenses up instantly. \nSIMON You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax. \nHELEN It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I-- \nSIMON Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role. \nHe puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly into a kiss.  This doesn't seem real to Helen.  She finds herself not pulling away.  He lowers her slowly until they are lying together on the bed. \nSIMON There you go.  That's right... \nHe slides his hand up her thigh.  The fingers, stroking in little circles, slips under her skirt.  And-- \nShe suddenly EXPLODES, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off her. \nHELEN NO!  Stop! (he keeps kissing her) Get off me RIGHT NOW! \nSimon struggles with her.  She gets one knee up under him and levers him up.  She pushes him to a standing position.  She sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt. \nHe looks forlorn and pathetic.  Now he's going to try pleading... \nSIMON If not for me, do it for democracy. \n193   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nKABOOM!!  The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny shaped-charges.  The concussion throws Simon forward on top of her.  Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine pistols and flashlights. \n194   INT. TRAILER - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT \nLit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips.  It looks bad. Simon and Helen sit up... stunned.  They look like two rabbits in the headlights of a truck.  She screams. \n195   INT. TRAILER - ON SIMON - NIGHT \nReacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly materialized as a nightmarish reality.  He is stunned. Blinking, mouth hanging open. \n196   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - SIMON'S POV - NIGHT \nWHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON LIGHT from a helicopter.  Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor- wash.  The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both. Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up. Harry yanks Simon to his feet. \n197   EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nGib comes out first with Helen.  She struggles like a wildcat, frankly surprising the hell out of Harry.  Simon is brought out, dazed and compliant.  Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB right in the balls.  Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs for it. \nHarry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen. She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her.  He grabs her and gets her in a headlock.  She bites the hell out of his arm.  Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon. Standard operating procedure.  Which is why he can't understand why Harry punches him, knocking him down. \nHarry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't talk without her recognizing his voice).  They head for the cars. \nCUT TO: \n198   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM/OBSERVATION CHAMBER - NIGHT \nAn empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large two-way mirror.  The door opens and Helen is escorted in by Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit.  Helen has a black hood over her head.  Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her, then leaves quickly. \nHelen whips the hood off and blinks in the light.  She wheels at the sound of the door locking and runs to it.  Pulls twice on the handle, without effect.  She crosses to the mirror and peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on the other side. \n199   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS is a dark chamber.  We see Helen perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing.  Harry and Gib, in silhouette, sit at a console.  Harry speaks into a microphone. \nHARRY Sit down. \n200   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nON HELEN'S SIDE of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by a DIGITAL PROCESSOR.  It is a cold booming mechanical voice. Harsh and inhuman. \nVOICE (HARRY) I said SIT DOWN. (she does) Who do you work for? \nHELEN Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary. \nVOICE (HARRY) Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation? \nHELEN He said he was an American agent. \n201   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT \nINSIDE THE CONTROL room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the glass, Helen.  Their voices sound normal on this side. \nHARRY How long have you been a member of his faction? \nHELEN I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him. \n", "test3_id": 2108}

{"test1_input": "T R U E   L I E S \nWRITTEN \nBY \nJAMES CAMERON \nTITLE SEQUENCE \n1   EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT \nThe snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs. \n2   EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT \nThe driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal- dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle- eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers. \nThe walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter. \nWith the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a glow pulsing under the ice. \n3   EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nCamera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall. \nSeem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled-glass of the ice above. \n4   EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nA dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing: \nHARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby. \nAfter a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky. \nHARRY Honey, I'm home. \n5   INT. / EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT \nMeet Harry's partner, ALBERT \"GIB\" GIBSON, an overweight twenty- year-man with a lived in looking face.  Gib answers Harry via his headset. \nGIB Roger that. (he covers the mike and turns) Hey, Fize!  Get your butt in here.  Harry's inside. \nOutside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees. \nFaisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse. \n6   EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nConcealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit. Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER. Very advanced. \nHARRY Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy? \nGIB (OVER) It's Talkradio.  You're on the air. \nHarry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side, containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for the ear-piece slung on the other.  He slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial. \nHarry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back service entrance. \n7   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nHarry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place. The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really notice.  He finger-tastes a dish as he passes. \nHARRY (French/ subtitled) This needs more garlic. \nHe breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the-- \n8   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nHere the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid- east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers. \nHarry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in his wake look at each other like \"Do you know him?\"   They shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the crowd.  Scanning. \nHARRY There's Daddy Petrobucks. \nHARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly     * greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a             * conversation. \nThe woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is a frank moment of returned interest.  Then the crowd shifts, cutting off their view of each other. \n9   INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT \nHarry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor.  * He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.     * \n10   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library.  He    * crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.         * \n11   EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT                                           * \nHarry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       * prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        * directly above.  He lets himself into--                          * \n12   INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                     * \n", "test1_true": "HARRY Modem in place.  Transmitting... now. \nHe pushes a button and a green light comes on. \n13   INT. VAN - NIGHT \nGib and Faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with DATA from Khaled's private computer. \nFAISIL Affirmatory.  We are in.                               * \nFast Faisil is a computer ace.  His fingers fly on the keyboard as he types rapid key commands.  We see familiar \"windows appear\".  The words are all in Arabic characters. \nFAISIL These are encrypted files, guys. This is going to take me a few minutes. \n14   OMITTED                                                          * \n15   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   * \nTIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR.  It opens a crack and a dental mirror     * comes out, looking around like a U-boat periscope.  Seeing the coast is clear Harry slips out.  But just as he is closing the door, a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away.  Harry turns smoothly.  He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard. \nHARRY (In Arabic/ subtitled) Where's the john around here?  I have to take a major leak. \nThe guard points warily down the corridor.  Harry nods and heads that way, back toward the party. \n16   INT. MAIN HALL/ STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nHarry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party. He is sipping champagne and looking bored.  He sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs, walkies in their hands.  He turns away as they pass him and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief... a temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses. \nHe senses someone next to him and turns.  It is the WOMAN.  She  * is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing. \nHARRY (indicating the bas- relief) Magnificent, isn't it? \nWOMAN Yes.  Hi, I'm Juno Skinner.  I thought I knew most of Khaled's friends but I don't believe I know you. \nHarry offers his hand to her. \nHARRY Renquist.  Harry Renquist. \n17   INT. VAN - NIGHT \nGib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database.  He scans rapidly for-- \nGIB Skinner.  Skinner.  Come on... \nGib finds the entry he's looking for.  Juno's picture and data appear on the screen. \nGIB Juno Skinner.  Art and antiquities dealer, specializing in ancient Persia. \n18   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nHarry turns back to the fragment of frieze. \nHARRY This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. \nJUNO Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period? \nHARRY (shameless) I adore it. \n19   EXT. DOCK/ BOATHOUSE (NIGHTVISION POV) - NIGHT \nSeen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's footprints leading to the boathouse.  He calls to one of the other guards, who comes running over. \n20   INT. MANSION - NIGHT \nHarry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear: \nGIB (VO) Harry, we got a problem.  Guards are swarming all over the dock. \nHarry glances up the stairs.  Khaled's SECURITY CHIEF is gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a walky.  Three SECURITY MEN come down the stairs, scanning the crowd.  Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's arm. \nHARRY Do you dance, Ms. Skinner? \nHe steers her toward the dance floor. \n21   INT. VAN - NIGHT \nGib, listening, rolls his eyes.  He looks through the night- vision scope.  Guards are running around outside the chateau. Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest.  Faisil is still jamming at the keyboard. \nFAISIL Okay, files are unlocked.  I'm in. I'm down, baby.  I got my hand up her dress and I'm going for the gold.  I'm-- \nGIB Just copy the goddamn files! (into his headset) Harry, don't be stopping to smell the roses, now.  You hear me, Harry? \n22   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT \nHarry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor.  She responds deftly.  They are well matched.  She parries each of his smooth moves with a flourish.  It is a contest of wills, and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy. Juno is hot.  He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her up.  She twirls into the crook of his arm.  Their faces are inches apart.  Wow.  The music ends and she gives him a wry grin. \nJUNO Well.  And I thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires. \nGIB (OVER) Harry, seconds count, buddy. Ditch the bitch, let's go. \nHARRY Unfortunately, Juno, I have a plane to catch. \nShe slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress. She hands it to him, maintaining eye contact.  Serious sparks. \n", "test1_id": 2106, "test2_input": "HARRY Uh, yes, it is important. \nJuno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP BEEP BEEP!!  Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at it.  The moment is spoiled. \nHARRY Uh, it looks like I have to run. I'll call you tomorrow.  Your proposal is very interesting. \n69   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib lets out a big exhale of relief.  He looks at his watch. \n70   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT \nHelen and Dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room table.  There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet. The food is getting cold.  Helen looks at her watch. \nDANA See. \n71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nHarry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker      * again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.  Gib keeps checking the rearview. \nGIB We have a friend.  Five cars back, inside lane.  They've been                       * on us since we left Juno's.                            * \nHarry adjusts the passenger side mirror. \nHARRY Station wagon? \nGIB Uh huh.  Want me to lose them? \nHARRY                                        * No.  We need this lead.                                * (into his Rover)                                  * Unit Seven.                                            * \nUNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)                          * Seven here. \nHARRY (into Rover)                                      * I need you at the Georgetown mall                      * in three minutes.                                      * \nSEVEN Copy that.  We're rolling. \nGIB Helen's going to be pissed. \nHARRY See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules. \n72   INT.  STATION WAGON - NIGHT \nThere are three men in the car.  YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the front, with Mahmoud driving.  In the back, shadowed, we can just make out ABU MALIK.  Yusif is massively built, with a body like a beer-keg.  Mahmoud is skinny and intense. \n73   OMITTED                                                          * \n74   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - MALL - NIGHT \nHarry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal. \nHARRY Test two three. (Gib nods, receiving) Pull over here. \nGib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.  Half a block behind them the station wagon does the same.  Harry slips on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car. \n75   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nHarry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.  He coughs slightly. \nGIB (in his ear) You don't smoke, dickhead. \nHarry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of cigarettes casually.  He turns his hand.  The tiny lens in the cigarette pack glints. \nPOV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.  The camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away. \nHARRY strolls into the mall.  It is an open promenade design, with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.  Harry watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the crowd behind him. \nGIB (VO) What's the plan? \nHARRY (apparently mumbling to himself) Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      * Beavis & Butthead.                                     * \n76   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him. \nGIB There's another guy, still in the car. \nHARRY (on radio) Stay on him. \nAll Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.  A soft cherry glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.  No features. \n77   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nHarry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway between shops.  In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they track him through the pedestrian traffic. \n78   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib in on the cellular phone. \nGIB Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry remembered something he left at the office.  You know Harry. \nAs he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the station wagon. \n79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "HELEN Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry. \nHelen hangs up the phone just as Dana strides through the room, putting on a jacket and heading for the front door. \nHELEN Where are you going? \nDANA Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie. \nHELEN No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake! \nDANA Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist. \nWe see the hurt in her eyes.  She doesn't hate her father.  She just misses him. \nHELEN That's not true, honey-- \nDANA It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine. \nDana runs out the kitchen by the other door.  Helen runs after her. \nHELEN Dana!  Come back here! \nThe slamming door is her answer. \n80   EXT. MALL - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nYusif sees Harry, up ahead, enter a public restroom.  He signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on the restroom. \n81   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT \nGib hangs up the car-phone.  Ten the bus blocking his view finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is empty.  No silhouette. \nGIB Oh shit. (into his headset) Harry, I lost the third guy. Harry? \n82   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT \nHarry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind him.  Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak. Mahmoud goes to the mirror.  Starts combing his hair.  He doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter nearby.  Harry is whistling.  Shaking himself. \nHARRY'S POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and Mahmoud.  Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls.  As he passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat-- \nHarry spins lightning fast.  He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a urinal. \nHarry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor. \nMahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.  He flops on his butt, slumping against the wall. \nYusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun arm.  They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun. Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls.  They hit a locked door, which pops open, banging inward. \nYusif drives Harry to the floor.  Harry's head is between the shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down uncomprehendingly at him. \nYusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall.  He twists Harry's wrist brutally.  He even pounds against Harry's hand with his knee.  The old guy winces. That's got to hurt.  Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops. Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls. \nHe punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple, spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal.  In case you haven't noticed, this is a messy, nasty fight.  Survival is like that. \nYusif sags into submission.  Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's wrists. \n83   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nGib is running full out, drawing his gun.  He has one finger jammed in his ear.  His gut is doing the rumba as he runs. \nGIB Harry?  Harry, you copy?!  Shit! \n84   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT \nHarry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open behind him.  He turns, thinking it is Gib.  It's not.  Malik raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire.  Harry spins Yusif between him and the machine pistol.  Yusif's beer-keg body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long enough for him to dive into a stall. \nMalik hoses the room with the Beretta.  The metal stalls are riddled with hits. \nHARRY is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting there.  The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on the far side.  Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his Glock. \nMALIK goes empty.  Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off rounds-- \nMalik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter tiles on the doorframe.  Then silence. \nHARRY (to the old guy) Sorry. \n85   EXT. MALL - NIGHT \nMOVING WITH MALIK, who backs rapidly away from the restroom, reloading. \nGIB (OFF) FREEZE!!! \nMalik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance behind a light-standard.  The terrorist doesn't hesitate.  His Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute. \nGib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about half as wide as he is.  Shots hit all around him, shattering window glass behind him.  His stomach sticks out from behind the pole.  He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the other side.  Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle everything behind him. \nGIB WRONG!  THIS IS NOT GOOD! \nJust when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck, Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians. Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it. \nHARRY Get back to the car! \nGib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after Malik.  Malik is fast and vicious.  He hurls people out of the way, sending shoppers sprawling.  Harry is ruthless in his pursuit.  They pound through the mall and out onto the street-- \n", "test2_id": 2107, "test3_input": "SIMON Cairo was a day at the beach next                      * to this. \n138   INT.

Now go. \nthru   OMITTED                                                          * \nPAGES 66-67 OMITTED                                              * \n156   EXT. STREET/CAR LOT - DAY \nSimon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting. Thinking he is supercool. \n157   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY \nSimon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place.  A hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be classics. \nSimon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line.  He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing the SALE PRICE of the car.  He sticks it back on the dash.  The car doesn't even belong to him! \n158   EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAR LOT - DAY \nHarry and Gib pull up.  They watch as Simon jumps out of the Vette and goes into the sales office. \nGIB (laughing) He's a goddamn used car salesman. This just gets better. (catching himself) Sorry Harry, I know this is painful. \nHarry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the street. \n159   INT. CAR LOT SALES OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)                 * \nTIGHT ON A TAPE PLAYER, with Simon's hand adjusting the volume. The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from the deck. \nPULL BACK to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over the din of a real place. \nSIMON It's a great little bar, Amanda, you'd love it.  Beirut's a great place if you know the city.                            * Listen, this isn't a secure line. I'll tell you all about it when I get back tomorrow... if I live. (pause) Scared?  Never!  Except of you-- \nDuring this, the owner of the place, DOUG WURTZ, has come out of the back room and looked out at the lot.  What Doug sees is-- \nHARRY, browsing among the cars. \nDOUG turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees him coming and speeds up his rap. \nSIMON --I have to go, baby.  A guy's coming toward me-- \nDoug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the cradle. \nDOUG                                         * Simon, look out there.  You see that man?  Notice how he's looking at the cars.  He's called a customer.  I know it's been a while, but do you remember what you're supposed to do when we have a customer? \n160   EXT. CAR LOT - DAY \nSimon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even reached him. \nSIMON It wants you too.  Feel it vibrate?  How about a little spin? \nSimon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs around the car.  He leaps over the closed door into the driver's seat and starts the car. \nSIMON You gotta jump in.  That's rule number one.  It takes a little practice, but there's no way around it. \n161   EXT. STREET - DAY \nSimon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back. \nSIMON See, it's not just the car, it's a total image.  An identity you have to go for.  This isn't some high-tech sports car...  it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it. \nSimon gives Harry a big grin.  Harry returns a knowing chuckle. Ha ha. \nSIMON What're we talking about here? Pussy, right? \nHARRY Absolutely. \nSimon laughs.  Harry laughs.  A big lusty, male-bonding kind of laugh. \nSIMON Well then this is a vital piece of equipment.  Used properly, it can change your life.  See, you cruise.  No racing.  This ain't a Ferrari.  You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you out.  You got to take it slow.  Old cars are like good women... they heat up fast. \nHow do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold?  Ask Harry. \nHARRY Keep talking. \nCUT TO: \n162   EXT. TACO STAND - DAY \nSimon is holding court.  Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his greatest area of expertise.  We see Harry laughing, going along with the guy.  Pretending to bond. \nSIMON Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle. \nHARRY And you've got one. \nSIMON It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are. \nHARRY So what's your angle? \nSIMON Sorry.  Trade secret. \n", "test3_id": 2108}

He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it springboards into the air... ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench. ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their bases and fly skyward. ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him. ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks. The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch. 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
John sinks by Henri's side. 
JOHN Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to drag him to his feet. 
JOHN Come on, taillights in five. 
HENRI I won't be coming with you this time. Save yourself. 
JOHN We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment 
THE COMMANDER'S SWORD flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's. 
HENRI Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER. 
HENRI Your life is my life... always. His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip. Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face 
THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER. But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air. He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick uselessly as he's lifted face to face. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Number 4. Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like mocking trophies. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER Your Cepan saved you on Lorien. The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER But this moment was inevitable. The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it. John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the moment when a warrior is born. ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which flutter to the ground like glittering confetti. John stares at the alien with calm confidence. 
JOHN Nothing is inevitable. 
ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES. The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers. TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over. The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction. 
IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION! 
John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the 
SUPERNOVA OF FIRE that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the night sky. Her breath catches in her throat. 
SARAH Oh my God... John. Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium. 
EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT 
It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles. Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians. 
SARAH John! She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope. Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs. 
SARAH John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN 
The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces. 
SARAH Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds. Six smiles, grateful. 
SIX Thanks.

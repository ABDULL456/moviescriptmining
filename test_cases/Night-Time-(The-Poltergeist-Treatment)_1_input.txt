As she puts the children to bed, they talk her into telling them a story. She concedes, and tells them a ghost story. As she tells her story, actual events in the house upstage the fictional story she is telling them, adding to and punctuating the higher points. Terrified, the babysitter, negligent of her duties, runs screaming from the house into the night. Neighbors' lights go on, obviously disturbed by the screaming. 
The older children get home to find the little ones sitting together on the steps, no babysitter in sight. The parents return to a story of a deserting babysitter who says their house is haunted. The evening's events have everyone on edge, especially Steven and Nora. Nora sits at her vanity brushing out her long auburn tresses. As she brushes her hair somewhat mindlessly past her right shoulder, an invisible wind lifts her hair out from her brush and her hand. It arches her hair slowly over her head and lays it to rest on her left shoulder. She sits frozen, unable to speak, the empty brush in her hand, her wide eyes locked on her image in the mirror. At that moment, she feels something touching her cheek. We see two indentations, such as fingers would make, as her cheek gently caves in, opening her lips, and her face is tilted upward by an invisible hand. She then receives a "ghost kiss," a long, forced, passionate kiss, from which she cannot free herself. As she is released, there is a noise from the living /dining area. Steven bolts from their bathroom, sees the wide-eyed, almost panicked, expression on his wife's face. He grabs her hand, and together they walk down the hall to check the house. The furniture in the dining room has been totally rearranged. The chairs are on top of the furniture. Some of the furniture has been moved from room to room. They wake the children, pack lightly, pick up the dog and leave to spend the night at the local Holiday Inn. They will stay there for the evening, then move into Nora's sister's house within a day or so.

That means candles on fire. \nMA Jack - \nJACK You should ask for candles for Sunday Treat, not dumb jeans. \nMA Sorry. I have to ask for stuff we really need that he can get easily. \nJACK But Old Nick gets anything, by magic. \nMA Try your cake, I bet it's delicioso. \nBut Jack is sulking.

End of the Selkie story: \nMA But one day the mermaid finds where the fisherman hid her comb. \nJACK Ha ha. \nMA So she runs home to the sea. \nShe lets her head and face sink under the water. \nJack sits up on her, upset. \nMa emerges and opens her eyes.

Dim light comes through the slats. Jack lies stroking the dangling clothes, the pictures glued to the wardrobe. He freezes at the sound of the beeps that mean the outside door is about to open. \nHe lies absolutely still, listening for Old Nick's entrance. He savors the scent of fresh air, but shivers: winter. \nBoom: now the door's shut again. \nOLD NICK (O.S.)

The grapes were way too much, so I got canned pears. \nJack can see Ma as she puts groceries away. \nMA OK. \nNow OLD NICK moves into view too. Forties, solidly built, blue-collar: a ordinary monster. \nOLD NICK What's that? A birthday cake? \nHe cuts himself a piece and eats it in a few bites. \nMa starts getting undressed. \nOLD NICK (CONT'D) Shoulda told me, I'd have brought him a present. \nJack twitches at this thrilling possibility. Old Nick starts undressing too: like some dull marriage. \nOLD NICK (CONT'D) What's he now, four? \nJack, in the wardrobe, is all agog for Ma to correct him. \nJACK (too low to be heard) Five. \nSounds of the adults getting into bed. The lamp clicking off. \nThen the familiar creaks of the bed. Jack doesn't know what they mean but is troubled.

There's Room, then Outer Space, then Heaven. Plant is real but not trees. Spiders are real and one time the mosquito that was sucking my blood. But squirrels and dogs are just TV, except Lucky my dog that might be some day. Mountains are too big to be real and the sea. \nIn the dark of the wardrobe, Jack is still counting. \nJACK One twenty-eight, one twenty- nine... \nJACK (V.O.) TV persons are flat and made of colors with red mouths and clothes instead of skin but me and you are real. Old Nick I don't know if he's real, maybe half? Green beans are real and chocolate but not ice cream. \nThe bedsprings are speeding up. \nJACK Three hundred six, seven, eight - \nA primal grunt from Old Nick. The creaking is done. Jack is asleep at the bottom of the wardrobe. Old Nick goes over to the TV and switches on sports. \nMA Shh. \nHe turns down the volume. The sound of the sports broadcast overlaps with the thud of the door closing. The wardrobe door opens admitting the faint light of the L.E.D on the keypad. \nWe cut to a shot of Ma putting a sleeping Jack into the bed.

Jack eats cereal and watches DORA (sound on very low). \nDORA AND BOOTS Where do we go next? River, Bridge, Highest Hill. Will you check my backpack for something to help us? \nLater. TV off. Jack creeps up to Ma and studies what he can see of her bruises, which are more purple-black today. \nHe tries to read Ma's watch but the angle makes it hard. \nHe plays at switching Ma on with the remote. \nLater. Jack plays chess (with their homemade papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 set) against his truck. \nLater. Kicks a shrivelled red balloon to keep it in the air. \nLater. It's turned cloudy. Jack nibbles a bagel at the table. \nLater.   He makes a tour of his domain, his friends. \nJACK (V.O.) Eggsnake's our longest friend and fanciest. Meltedy Spoon's the best to eat with because he's more blobbier. Labyrinth is the twistiest and she hides things so I don't know where. Toilet's the best at disappearing poo. Lamp's the brightest except when the powercut. (glances at Ma) You're the best at reading and songs and lots except if you're having a Gone Day. I'm the best at drawing and jumping and growing and nearly everything. \nHe examines the truck's broken axle. Yanks on another wheel until it snaps off. Then the last two. He twists the doors off. Stuffs the truck, its parts and remote in the trash. \nLater, light fading. Jack lies beside Ma, longing to breastfeed. Lifts the edge of her t-shirt, but doesn't dare. \nHe sits up, rests his hand on the bump of Ma's foot. \n28   INT. ROOM - DAY                                             28 \nNext day.

Jack is watching wildlife while Ma cleans up from breakfast: baby turtles emerging from shells and heading down the beach. \nTying up the trash bag, she finds the truck, and realizes that Jack has destroyed it because it came from Old Nick. \nJACK Are turtles real? \nMa's head shoots up: this is the first sign that he's starting to believe her about the world. \nMA Totally real. I had a pet turtle. DAVID ATTENBOROUGH Crocodiles, sharks, and hungry fish are all waiting in the shallows. \nJACK Crocodiles and sharks - \nMA They're all real. \n(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED:                                               29 \nCurious, Jack switches channels: a 1970 BBC mini-series, THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII. \nANNE Oh, my lord... \nHENRY (eyeing the child) Not while he plays here... \nANNE (smiling) I'll send him away - \nJACK (OVERLAPPING) Real? \nMA Ah, they're real people playing dress-up, pretending to be people from hundreds of years ago. \nJack is puzzled by that. \nHe switches channels: TOM AND JERRY. \nJACK Just TV? \nMA You're getting it! \nHe watches the slapstick violence with relish. \nJACK When Old Nick comes back, I'm going to kick him in the butt. \nThis suddenly punctures her mood. \n", "test2_true": "Ma marches over and turns off the TV, startling him. \nMA (CONT'D) One night I stood behind the door with the lid of the toilet tank - \nJack looks towards it, confused: what lid? \n(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED: (2)                                         29 \nMA (CONT'D) - it used to have a lid, it was the heaviest thing in Room. When he came in I tried to smash it down on his head. But I messed up, Jack. He shoved the door shut and grabbed me by the wrist - that's why it's sore now. \nJACK We could wait till he's asleep and kill him dead. \nMA Yes we could, but then we'd have no more food - and we wouldn't know the code, on the door, to get out. \nJACK The Grandma and the Grandpa could come. \nMA They don't know where we are, Jack. Room's not on any map. \nHis eyes slide to the blank screen. \n(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED: (3)                                           29 \nJACK Can I have more TV? \nMA Jack, I want you to listen to me.

By all accounts he is a normal, high-functioning, happy little boy. Amazing. \nMA He is. He's my life. I never could have survived without him. \nHOSTESS You made life as normal and nurturing as you could given the environment. You gave him a childhood. How did you manage to do that? \nMA I... I didn't think about it. I didn't plan it. When I found out I was pregnant with Jack, it just seemed like a terrible joke. You know? To bring someone into that place, it just seemed so wrong.

UTAH No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!! 
BODHI Naw, you pull it! 
Utah looks down.  The earth is rushing at them.  2500 feet. 
BODHI Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with? 
UTAH Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself! 
BODHI Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four... 
1000 feet.  The ground is close enough to see details. Cactus, sagebrush.  They rocket past the bright yellow canopy of Roach's chute a hundred feet away. 
UTAH You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!! 
They're right in each other's faces.  Taking it way beyond the edge. Bodhi's eyes are wild.  A gleeful, adrenalized madness... his pupils are the entrance to Hell. 
BODHI Three seconds... two... one... 
UTAH SHIT!! 
Utah flings the Casull away and pulls the rip-cord so hard he almost loses his grip anyway.  POOM!  The canopy cracks out. Full and round and bright red. The ground roars at us. WHAP!  Utah and Bodhi hit.  Hard. 
They slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a cloud of dust. Rocks and debris clatter into silence. 
NEARBY Roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll. He moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his eyes stare without blinking right at the sun.  Next to him the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the sand.  Roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills that caper in the desert wind. 
UTAH AND BODHI are both completely still as the dust clears.  Finally they groan and stir.  Necks move, hands move, legs move.  Bodhi rolls to his knees.  He is cut and scraped, the blood running bright down his dust-covered skin. 
Utah looks around, blinking. Surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red-hot Mexican desert. Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him. 
BODHI Wild ride, huh? 
UTAH (gasping) Jesus Christ, Bodhi! 
Utah tries to rise and -- grabs his knee in agony.  We see by his mask of pain that it's totaled inside. 
BODHI That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad. 
He looks up at the sound of an engine. 
BODHI'S POV of his big four-by roaring toward us with a meteor tail of dust.  It slides to a stop next to them. Rosie gets out of the driver's side and stands calmly with a sawed-off over his shoulder. 
Utah blinks through his sweat and pain at-- 
TYLER running toward him out of the dust.  She kneels next to him and puts her arms around him.  Bodhi limps to the truck.  Through the swirling dust we see him look back. 
BODHI You had me worried there, for a second, Johnny U. 
He swings up into the four-by and guns the engine.  Rosie hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward Roach's billowing gravemarker. 
Johnny touches Tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of blood. He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin. 
HOLD ON the truck moving off in a heat-shimmered cloud of dust, becoming a mirage, then a memory as we-- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
AN ENORMOUS WAVE which FILLS FRAME, seeming to rise endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray. 
EXT.  BEACH DAY - DAY 
An unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a storm sky. Wind whips sand across the narrow beach-road, throwing it against the front doors of the LIGHTHOUSE PUB. TITLE OVER: ONE YEAR LATER... 
INT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY 
Dark.  Almost empty.  A snarling crocodile head is mounted above a tapper of Guinness Stout.  A Koala bear with plastic eyes holds a Foster's.  A BARTENDER with leathered skin washes glasses. At the bar, a single disheveled customer... human driftwood. GUST OF WIND blows open a shuttered window. The bartender moves to close it. 
BARTENDER Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore the bloody storm hits. 
JOHNNY UTAH swivels toward CAMERA.  His tanned face is barely recognizable, jaws hidden underneath a slight beard, long bleach-out hair swept behind an ear.  His muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey. The man seems deadly focused. 
UTAH Storm's already here... It's bringing me the swell.

RITA Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! 
ZEDD How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! 
IVAN Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. (arms out in trademark stance) The "booger man" is taking over. 
Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair. 
ZEDD Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! 
Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield. 
MORDANT Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week! 
Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS. 
IVAN Ooooh, that tickles! 
Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR. 
IVAN My turn. 
He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE. 
Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!! 
Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE. 
RITA This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. 
Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant. 
IVAN Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. 
Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan. 
GOLDAR We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. 
MORDANT Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention... 
Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him. 
GOLDAR (apologetic) He's just visiting for the summer. (beat) Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one? 
IVAN Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! 
He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR, 
MORDANT Gasunteidt. 
Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS. 
THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until... 
IVAN SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! 
The Tengu fall dead silent. 
IVAN Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! 
The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS. 
IVAN Mordant, go with them and report back to me! 
MORDANT You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- 
One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF LIKE COLOSSAL BATS. 
MORDANT IIIIIII!!! 
ANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE 
Zedd waves his arms around in outrage. 
ZEDD Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! 
RITA From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!

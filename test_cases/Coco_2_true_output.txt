MIGUEL It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it-- 
MAMÁ IMELDA Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that... (disgust) ...musician! He is DEAD to this family! 
MIGUEL Uh, you're all dead. 
Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and tries to reach a plate of food. 
CLERK ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije is that? 
Miguel steps up, trying to pull Dante away from the treats. 
MIGUEL That's just Dante. 
TÍA ROSITA He sure doesn't look like an alebrije. 
Tía Rosita gestures to the fantastical creatures fluttering on the other side of the window. 
TÍO OSCAR He just looks like a plain old dog... 
TÍO FELIPE ...Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop. 
CLERK Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! -- terribly allergic. 
MIGUEL But Dante doesn't have any hair. 
CLERK And I don't have a nose, and yet here we are -- ACHOO!! 
MAMÁ IMELDA But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over. 
Miguel realizes something.        He sheepishly pulls out the folded photo. 
MIGUEL Oh... 
He unfolds the photo. 
MAMÁ IMELDA You took my photo off the ofrenda?! 
MIGUEL It was an accident! 
Mamá Imelda turns to the clerk, fire in her eyes. 
MAMÁ IMELDA How do we send him back?! 
CLERK Well, since it's a family matter... (flipping pages) The way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing. 
MIGUEL That's it? 
CLERK Get your family's blessing, and everything SHOULD go back to normal. But you gotta do it by sunrise! 
MIGUEL What happens at sunrise? 
PAPÁ JULIO Híjole!   Your hand! 
Miguel looks at his hand. The tip of one of his fingers has started to turn skeletal. He turns pale. He starts to faint when Papá Julio picks him up and gently slaps him awake. 
PAPÁ JULIO Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you fainting on us. 
CLERK But not to worry! Your family's here, you can get your blessing right now. 
The clerk searches the ground near Tía Rosita. 
CLERK Cempasúchil, cempasúchil.        Aha! Perdón, señora. 
Tía Rosita titters. The clerk plucks a marigold petal from the hem of her dress. He hands the petal to Mamá Imelda. 
CLERK (to Imelda) Now, you look at the living and say his name. 
Imelda turns to Miguel. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel. 
CLERK Nailed it.     Now say: I give you my blessing. 
MAMÁ IMELDA I give you my blessing. 
The marigold petal glows in her fingers.            Miguel brightens. But Mamá Imelda is not finished. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) I give you my blessing to go home... 
The glow of the marigold petal surges. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) To put my photo back on the ofrenda... 
Each added condition makes the petal glow brighter.           Imelda delivers it like a scolding, but Miguel nods. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) And to never play music again! 
The petal surges one last time. 
MIGUEL What?   She can't do that! 
CLERK Well technically she can add any conditions she wants. 
Miguel stares her down.      Imelda is firm in her resolve. 
MIGUEL Fine.

RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores them in favor of the raucous concert. In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s feet. 
MOONEY (sweating profusely) Jesus, kid, calm down!! Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER 
RAILING. Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing-- Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion. 
CHLOE Oh my God-- (checking Mooney) Someone call 911! A CROWD starts to gather when -- Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's gun. 
TOMLIN It's over kid. Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end of the pier. MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this. 
TOMLIN (CONT'D) For all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. Where is it? Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him. Like a nightmare, he closes in. Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up. 
RYAN Aw shit... Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the 
TENSION... He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts. Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but it causes the crowd around him to PANIC. 
CROWD GOER (OS) Dude's gotta gun! Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground. He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT! SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as he spins headlong into the Pacific! TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the CHOPPY WATER below. 
GREER Under the pier. Go! Go!

His lungs convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot needles are pushing their way through his chest. The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon! Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater, BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty. 
As he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back and forth underwater like a rag doll.

He unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out the cellphone, which thank God is actually dry. Ryan forces himself into action; stumbling, exhausted into a --

An array of rowing shells covered in ghostly, flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted. This place is also filled with storage equipment, such as buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol.

RYAN - sees Tomlin coming.   Ryan's trapped like a rat -- and dripping blood everywhere. He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only useless boating tools (sanders, saws, box cutters, etc.) 
RYAN (to himself) Think! Think!

Chloe hands Mooney a cup of water and frantically looks around for the paramedics. Mooney starts rising to his feet. 
CHLOE You better lie still. The paramedics should be here shortly. But Mooney's obstinate.   He rises despite her best efforts.

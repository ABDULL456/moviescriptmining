MANOLETE 
Some choice. 
PILLSBURY 
G 
ood choice. I like see Canada. 
Pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again. 
ILEY 
Charlie, keep these two covered. 
Charlie pulls his .45. Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP. 
RILEY (CONT'D) 
Take a right onto Route Six. 
Slack pulls out. 
SLACK 
This is what you were thinking about all along. You got me out here figuring I'm a boy scout, and now you're telling me we're just 
stealing a fucking car? 
ILEY 
You have a problem with that? 
SLACK 
No. I like the way you think. 
HARLIE 
I like the way he thinks, too. Just look at me you can tell I like the way he thinks. 
RILEY 
Take another right. 
SLACK 
How do you know which way you're going? Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT shifts onto another MAP. 
RILEY 
I built a homing device into Dead Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
DEAD RECKONING stops on a long road, at the end of which stands... ...a MILITARY COMPLEX. THE BEAM of a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps back and forth over the buildings, a sign of life. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
CHOLO checks his watch. 11:29. He speaks into a TRANSMITTER. 
CHOLO 
Mouse. Anything? 
INT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT 
MOUSE stands in the shed, holding a transmitter of his own. 
MOUSE 
Not yet. No boat. No money. No nothing. 
INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT 
PRETTY BOY 
I'm telling you, he's never gonna pay. 
CHOLO 
That's why we're here. 
CHOLO looks out the window to the searchlight sweeping over the military complex in the distance. 
INT/EXT. IMPALA - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
SLACK drives as RILEY monitors his "Game Boy". 
RILEY 
Shit. He's going to Ross Park. 
SLACK

1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1 
Foreboding organ music is heard... 
We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... 
The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... 
The ominous organ music continues as... 
From the bottom of the frame... 
A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... 
Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. 
SUDDENLY-- 
A shrill factory whistle blows-- 
ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering -- the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream-- 
And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. 
He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. 
The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right side up as-- 
GENTLEMAN Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. 
We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before us. Strangely impassive. 
We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a world of silhouettes and shadows.

Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund and sleek. Impressive muttonchops. 
BANKER He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown, And what if none of their souls were saved? They went to their maker impeccably shaved... 
More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the Gentleman and the Banker as... 
BANKER By Sweeney, By Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. 
Although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact, GHOSTS. 
GHOSTS Swing your razor wide, Sweeney! Hold it to the skies! Freely flows the blood of those Who moralize! 
As they continue, the new figures become more distinct... 
THE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a crimson imperial uniform... 
GENERAL His needs were few, his room was bare: 
THE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical attire... 
PRIEST A lavabo and a fancy chair... 
THE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting suit... 
TOURIST A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop... 
THE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious long hair...

STUDENT For neatness he deserves a nod, Does Sweeney Todd... 
GENTLEMAN The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt. 
CREIGHTON Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is-- 
ED Look, uh... Creighton... 
He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the cigarette planted in his mouth. 
ED ...You're not gonna screw me on this? 
CREIGHTON *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never-- 
ED All right. 
CREIGHTON And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You-- 
ED OK. 
Creighton mops his brow again. 
CREIGHTON So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then? 
CAR 
Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background. 
ED (V.O.) The next day was Saturday. We were going to a reception for Doris' cousin Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner out near Modesto. Doris didn't much feel like going, and I didn't either, but, like she said, we had a Commitment. 
Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length: 
DORIS ...I hate wops. 
Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him. 
DORIS ...What's so damn strange about that? 
ED I didn't say a word. 
She looks back out at the road. 
DORIS ...*You* didn't have to grow up with 'em. 
This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head. 
DORIS ...Family. Boy. 
BY A BARN 
Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled with food. 
A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and screams: 
CHILD He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's ridin' Garibaldi! 
Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps at the pig's ass with a large straw hat. 
ED (V.O.) That was when she started drinking. 
Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine from a water glass. Ed stands nearby. 
A large woman hugs Doris. 
WOMAN How you doin', Doris, you been OK? 
DORIS How're you, Constanza? 
WOMAN Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And how you been, uh... 
ED Ed. 
WOMAN Ed. How's a business?

151   EXT. SIDE OF THE GAS STATION - NIGHT (RAIN)                             151 
Adam stops at a payphone. A long moment before he reaches for the receiver. With a breath, he dials 911. 
OPERATOR (V.O.) 911 Emergen... 
He hangs up. 
152   EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)                                  152 
Zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket. With a wad of paper towels, he cleans the hood of the car.

153   INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)                              153 
Washing his face, Adam looks at his reflection in the scratched mirror. He steps to the urinal, unbuttons. 
Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He looks down at his crotch. 
154   EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)                                154 
Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches. 
With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he was wearing. 
ZACK Holy sh... 
He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can. They keep their voices low anyway. 
ZACK They wouldn't have been listening all this time. 
ADAM Hello, they could have been recording it. Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did it. 
A beat. 
ZACK (an idea) What if we were just running lines? For a scene? 
Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment, just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie calm... 
ZACK There's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet. 
ADAM They will.

ZACK No. Listen. If there's no body, there's no crime. 
155   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAIN)                                               155 
The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for someone to sneak up on them. 
Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts. 
ZACK Stop. Okay, stop! 
ADAM What? 
ZACK It's a Miata. 
All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe. 
ZACK We'll put her in the passenger seat. 
ADAM Where will I...Or you... 
ZACK In the passenger seat. Holding her up. 
Adam shudders at the thought. 
With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright. 
He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep. 
ZACK Little help? 
ADAM (not moving) I can't. 
ZACK What do you mean?

ADAM I can't do this. 
Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate, tears swelling. 
ZACK Okay, listen to me... 
ADAM She's dead. 
ZACK She's not dead. 
ADAM She's dead. I hit her and I killed her. 
He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them. 
ZACK No you didn't, okay? This is all just make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting scared. 
Adam laughs to himself, still crying. 
ZACK See, there's the lights, and there's the camera. Watch your blocking. (pointing) There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi, Michelle!" 
ADAM Hi, Michelle.

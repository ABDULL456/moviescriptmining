She waits for Benjamin's response... 
CAROLINE (reading) "I didn't leave right away..." 
DAISY (reacting) No? 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "I stayed in Paris for awhile, just to look out for her..." 
197A   EXT. PARIS - DAY                                          197A 
Benjamin in Paris... 
197B   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT        197B 
DAISY I never knew that. 
135A. 
197C   EXT. PARIS - DAY                                           197C 
Benjamin in Paris, "watching over her." 
197D   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT         197D 
Daisy in bed...She winces with pain... her breathing becoming ragged... 
CAROLINE I'll get the nurse... 
She goes into the hall... Daisy left to deal with the remnants of her mortality... The Nurse coming into the room... Caroline behind her... times her pulse. 
THE NURSE Let's get you comfortable. 
She raises the morphine level...straightens her covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to Caroline...Caroline going over to her. 
THE NURSE (CONT'D) Pulse rate's slowing...She's getting less oxygen...You'll notice her struggle to breathe...Will you be alright? 
Caroline nods...The Nurse gives her a compassionate look and leaves...Caroline stands, her arms protectively across her chest, watching her mother...Daisy hums the particular ragtime song that Benjamin would play on the piano...She opens her eyes, as if not completely sure where she is...telling Caroline... 
DAISY Every morning Monsieur Foley leaves eggs and bread and mil,. There's a cafe across the street. People sitting and drinking and talking... I lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life... about people... about home... until I fall asleep. 
She looks at Caroline as if to say, "What happened to him...?" 
(CONTINUED) 
197D   CONTINUED:                                                 197D 
CAROLINE (reading) He said, "I went back..." But then there are a whole lot of pages torn out... 
She looks at a loose piece of paper... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) "...I listened to the sound of the house..." I think I already read that... (looking) The next thing he wrote... he spilled something on it... It's hard to read... Something about "sailing." Does that make sense? 
DAISY (in her own reality) A man would go up and clean it. Try and fix what was broken. 
198    INT. THE TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS- DAY, 1960                 198 
A man up on the clock doing just that. Closing its face. The cherubic angels pushing the hands on its way backwards... "1960." 
199    EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN, LOUISIANA - ANOTHER DAY, 1960         199 
We see a SAILBOAT out on the lake... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S I learned to sail on an old boat of my father's from the Lake House... 
And we see Benjamin, the wind in his hair, sailing an old sailboat... And the change in his appearance is startling... His hair is without a trace of gray... His face with barely a wrinkle, chiseled...He is a healthy man in his 40s now... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I can't lie, I did enjoy the company of a woman or two... 
200    EXT. A NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT                       200 
Benjamin and a Woman standing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant, in the middle of an ardent kiss... As a taxi pulls up... 
200A   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - DAYBREAK                         200A 
Benjamin at the door kissing another Woman goodbye...going home 
200B   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ANOTHER           200B MORNING, 1960 
Benjamin's door opening...Another Woman, disheveled, coming out of his room... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) ...Or maybe three... 
Benjamin seeing her to the stairs...And as she starts down the stairs to leave...we see a cluster of old people, ready for the day, looking up at them...the woman making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the door...Benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the old timers and starts back into his room...He slows at a second story hallway window...looking outside at the walkway...the familiar street beyond...If we didn't know any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come home 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) And in the spring of 1962... 
201    EXT. THE STREET, BY NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962      201 
We see Benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the street on his way home... leaves the motorcycle out in front... 
202    EXT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - END OF THE DAY, 1962                 202 
He comes to the gate, opening it, coming into the yard, shutting the gate behind him, going up the walkway. An Old Man is on the porch, quietly rocking. And Queenie, for some reason is standing just outside the front door on the porch... an apron in her hands... She nods to Benjamin... talking to the Old Man in the rocking chair... but she seems to be watching Benjamin, as he walks around the house -- to the back door. He takes off his dirty work boots, leaves them on the porch. 
(CONTINUED) 
202   CONTINUED:                                                        202 
He hops the back steps, and starts to open the kitchen door, when it opens... And DAISY, now 36, but still with her unmistakable blue eyes, is standing before him... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She came back. 
They look at each other in silence...and they simply smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing years... They embrace...for some time... and kiss... As people who haven't seen each other, and have thought about each other... for a very long time... And it just is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives... and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and breaks your heart. 
203   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962                  203 
A radio plays... they sit at the kitchen table, eating dinner... the conversation muted... They don't know really where to begin, where did they leave oft...so they don't begin until they can.... 
DAISY Don't you want to know where I've been? 
BENJAMIN No. I don't care where you've been -- I'm just happy you're back. 
And we see Queenie has come into the kitchen... in her nightgown now... 
QUEENIE (pure Queenie) How come you didn't write or nothin'? Just disappearing like that? 
DAISY It was what I needed to do for myself. 
QUEENIE I never took you to be selfish. I hope I'm not wrong. I'm not usually wrong about people. 
And Queenie leaves the kitchen... 
DAISY She's still taking care of you. (CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:                                                   203 
Benjamin slightly smiles. They look at each other. 
DAISY (CONT'D) You're not talking. You haven't said more than two words to me. 
BENJAMIN I don't want to ruin it... 
And they sit quietly in the kitchen, looking at each other, silently eating... 
204   INT. BACK STAIRWAY - NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962          204 
Benjamin carries her bags upstairs. They reach the third floor. 
205   INT. HALLWAY, NOLAN HOUSE - 3RD FLOOR - THAT NIGHT, 1962     205

Viko eyes the mirror. All clear. Turning onto a DESERTED STREET. 
114   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           114 
Kathy HURTLES closer to the silhouette... TWB 56. 
She turns. It's Irka. Kathy cranks the wheel, driving off the road and onto... 
A WIDE FIELD 
The SUV is jolted by the uneven terrain. Irka peers into the blinding light. Then runs... 
115   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          115 
Viko drives up the deserted street. SUDDENLY two BATTERED MERCEDES fly out from SIDE ROADS and block the way. 
Viko BRAKES hard. Raya is thrown to the side of the Van. 
116   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           116 
Kathy stops the car, jumps out, and runs after Irka. 
KATHY Irka! 
Irka's legs start to give. Kathy gains on her. 
117   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          117 
Viko REVERSES and TURNS -- but a Mercedes ROARS -- 'round the other side -- BASHING the side of the Van. 
118   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           118

119   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          119 
Two MEN jump out of the cars. With RIFLES. Viko SPEEDS forward. But.. 
GUNFIRE. Raya SCREAMS. A TIRE BLOWN OUT. 
The Van SKIDS to a HALT. Viko SMASHES against the window. 
Raya tries the doors, but they won't open. She wails, SLAMMING herself against the door. Desperate. 
120   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           120 
Kathy raises her arms, waving... 
Irka turns. Kathy can see her clearly now, disoriented beyond bearing. Irka shields her face from the distant headlights. TWB 57. 
Kathy steps out of their glare. And then...Irka recognizes her. She collapses, releasing confused tears. Kathy walks over, careful, slowly bending to help. 
IRKA Please... let me die. 
Kathy holds her. As the young girl cries. 
121   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          121 
The Men approach the Van. Raya's BANGING ECHOES from inside, reverberating around the empty street. Nobody can hear her... 
122   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                              122 
Isolated stars peek through clouds, drifting over dark hills stretching far into the horizon.... 
123   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                           123 
Kathy and Viko sit silent. Barry hangs up the phone. 
BARRY Okay. We've got a safe house in the mountains. Nobody knows she's here, so we're clear to take her there now. 
Kathy looks across the room to Irka, who sits hunched, looking out the window. Totally alone. 
124   EXT. FARM HOUSE - MOUNTAINS - NIGHT                           124 
A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE lead Irka inside a small home. In the MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Shrouded in the black night. Nobody will find her here. In the doorway, Irka turns to Kathy and Viko. 
IRKA (BROKEN ENGLISH) Where is Raya? 
They stare back at her. The woman closes the door. Kathy and Viko stand in the dead silence. His face bruised. 
KATHY Let's go back to the Florida Bar-- 
VIKO You think he'd be that stupid? 
KATHY I don't care! I have nothing else to go on, do I? 
Adrenalin overtaking sadness. Viko follows Kathy to the car. TWB 58. 
125   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      125

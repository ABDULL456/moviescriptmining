Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him -- 
-- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's face. 
It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun. 
GABRIEL (cruel smile) You wanted a weapon, convict? You got one. 
Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and Pug haul him up. With venom: 
GABRIEL Merry Christmas-Eve. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy. 
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG 
Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and Jumpy. 
Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper. 
GABRIEL Commit this thing to memory. Every guard, every exit... don't tape it to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. That's the Gospel right there. The Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John... 
Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her. 
He smiles right back. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands." 
INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE 
The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open. 
Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo. 
A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP. 
Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table. 
Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow. 
A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa coat. 
AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt. 
A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat. 
And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT. 
EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK 
Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake. 
RUDY AND ASHLEY 
sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky. 
ASHLEY Where should we go, Nick? When we're gone from here... where should we go... 
The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm: 
PUG (O.S.) Okay, who had the cheeseburger with bacon; what about a roast beef, I've got two roast beefs here -- 
JUMPY (O.S.) Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine -- 
MERLIN (O.S.) I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there? 
PUG (O.S.) I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs -- 
MERLIN (O.S.) Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon -- 
As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake. 
Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there. 
RUDY This time right now... Dad's stacking wood out back, getting ready for tomorrow. Little blaze in the fireplace. Mom's setting out the good silver, hanging her cinammon sticks, up in the doorways. Getting out her scratchy old records... singing along... 
Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look. 
RUDY I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home. 
ASHLEY We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember? 
RUDY Well. I'm going home. 
GABRIEL 
sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a savage bite. 
Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes. Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water. 
ON FULL SCENE 
The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures scattered, watching day turn to night...

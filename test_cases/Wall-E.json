It's the new red! \nMONORAIL PASSENGERS Oooohh... \nPassengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons. Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE. \nWALL-E Whoa. \nTheir monorail speeds into a glass tunnel. \nINSIDE THE TUNNEL \nWall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him. Spots Eve on the other side. Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary. But her chair moves backwards. Smashes Wall-E against the back wall. No way getting past her. Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention. She's oblivious. Chats incessantly on her holo-screen: \nMARY Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me started! Every holo-date I've been on has been a virtual disaster! If I could just meet one who wasn't so superficial. There are no good men out there!... \nWall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.

I know `cause I've scrolled through them all -- (Gasp) What the --? \nMary's chair shorts out. ...holo-screen shuts off... ...jumpsuit defaults back to red... For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view. Her eyes slowly dilate. It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time... \nMARY (mesmerized) Huh... ? \nHer gaze falls on Wall-E. He waves politely. \nWALL-E Wall-E. \nMARY (beat) M-mary. \nWALL-E Ee-vah. \nHe points to Eve on the other side of Mary. Gestures he'd like to get by. She is slow to understand. \nMARY Huh?

Never done that before. Tries it some more... \nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR \nWall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck. Marvels at it all. His view suddenly goes dark. The elevator doors open on... \nINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe large circular room is dimly lit. Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other. A massive console wraps around its entirety. Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights. \nA CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers. \nGopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps. Suddenly the wheel disengages. The autopilot (AUTO). A single camera eye lights up its center. A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling. Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes. Auto eyes Eve. Scans her. Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows. \nAuto detects Eve's plant light. Goes still... Begins computing rapidly. The number \"A113\" flashes on his lens. An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher. \nWall-E watches the interchange. Nervous. Without warning, Auto heads in his direction. Wall-E boxes up. A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him. Irises open, like a trapdoor. \nWall-E drops... \nINT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS \n...and hits the floor hard in the room below.

The autopilot in the background of each picture. Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other. From human to gelatinous blob. We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT. A blobby Captain. It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed. \nHe reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm. Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake. \nActivates the POYSC SAMPLE. It plays loud.

Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes. \nCAPTAIN (Giggles) \nLines light on the floor. Lead his chair automatically to the elevator. Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close. \nON THE BRIDGE \nElevator doors swish open. The Captain still half-asleep. Claps his hands twice. \nOn cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console. Pours a cup. CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers. The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH. Leads him over to the coffee. Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.

Spiral gracefully around one another. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) \"Dancing\" - A series of movements, involving two partners, where speed and rhythm match harmoniously with music. \nWall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.

Reprimands them from the pool's edge: \nLIFEGUARD-BOT No splashing, no diving. \nJOHN & MARY (annoyed) Ahh! Go on! \nJohn splashes the robot. It shorts out. \nON UPPER DECK \nEve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck. Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS. Eve peeks through the towels. Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.

Formally presents him the plant. He takes it in his hands. Still potted in the old boot. Gazes at it in wonder. \nCAPTAIN We can go back home...for the first time! (laughs) What's it like now? \nEve shrugs. Doesn't know how to answer. \nCAPTAIN No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for myself! \nHe turns to his console. Hits a button.

Where's the blue sky... \nHe looks over to his computer screen. The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display. Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen. \nCAPTAIN ...Where's the grass? \nHis face drops. Slumps in defeat. The dream is over. \nON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN \nThe HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays... It stirs the Captain out of his funk. He looks up at the screen.

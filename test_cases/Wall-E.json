{"train": "WALL-E \nWritten by \nAndrew Stanton & Pete Docter \nEXT. SPACE \nFADE IN: \nStars. The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays. \n\"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers...\" \nMore stars. Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas... A single planet. Drab and brown. Moving towards it. Pushing through its polluted atmosphere. \n\"...Close your eyes and see it glisten...\" \nEXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS \nA range of mountains takes form in the haze. Moving closer. The mountains are piles of TRASH. The entire surface is nothing but waste. \n\"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air...\" \nA silhouetted city in the distance. What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash. Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high. Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues. They go on for miles. \nEXT. AVENUE OF TRASH \n\"...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile...\" \nSomething moving on the ground far below. A figure at the foot of a trash heap. A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash. Rusted, ancient. Cute. Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting. \nMini-shovel hands collect junk. Scoop it into his open chassis. His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste. A faded label on his corroded chest plate: \"Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class\" (WALL-E) \nWall-E spits out a cube of trash. Stacks it with the others. \nSomething catches his eye. Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack. A hubcap. The sun reflects off it. Wall-E checks the sky. \nON TRASH HEAP HORIZON \nThe sun sets through the smoggy haze. \n\"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --\" \nHe places the hubcap in his compactor. Presses a button on his chest. The song stops playing. The end of a work day. \nWall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back. Whistles for his pet COCKROACH. The insect hops on his shoulder. They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER. \nEXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK \nWall-E travels alone. Traverses miles of desolate waste. Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather. \nPasses haunting structures buried within the trash. Buildings, highways, entire cities... Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO. \"Buy N Large\" \"BNL\" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life. There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate. \nCLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over. Headline: \"TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!\" The deck: \"BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!\" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile. \nWall-E's old treads are threadbare. Practically falling apart. Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach. He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS. Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own... \nEXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nWall-E now sports the newer treads. Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS. The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them. \nBILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash) Too much garbage in your face? (Ad #2: starliner in space) There's plenty of space out in space! (Ad #3: starliners take off from Earth) BNL starliners leaving each day. (Ad #4: WALL-E units wave goodbye) We'll clean up the mess while you're away. \nEXT. EDGE OF THE CITY \n...A HAND. \nShe lets the insect crawl up her arm. Wiggles into her workings. It tickles. \nEVE [Giggles] \nWall-E relaxes. CHUCKLES privately. \nEve sonically picks up Wall-E's location. Locks onto him. \nArm converts to laser cannon. Fires rapidly. Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts. Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him. \nWall-E now exposed. Nowhere to hide. Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably. Eve holds her fire. \nEVE (electronic hums) [Identify yourself.] \nShe slowly approaches Wall-E's box. Keeps her gun trained on him. \nEVE (electronic hums) [Repeat. Identify yourself.] \nWall-E peeks out from his box. Doesn't understand a thing she says. Doesn't care. Can't believe she's real. The cockroach climbs down her gun arm. Jumps onto his master. \nEve scans Wall-E. A RED LIGHT appears on her chest. Buzzes \"negative\". He's not what she's looking for. She retracts her gun arm. Hovers off. Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck. \nWALL-E [Sigh.] \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY \nLOUIS ARMSTRONG'S \"LA VIE EN ROSE\" PLAYS \nEve scans through the market. Wall-E follows from a safe distance. A stray puppy-dog. \nEve glances over at him. Wall-E panics. Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS. Creates an avalanche. \nThey chase him down a flight of stairs. Wall-E reaches the exit doors. Won't open! Carts pig pile on top of him. \nEXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT \nWall-E perched on the roof. Patiently watches Eve fly. She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight. \nEve comes in for a landing below. Shuts down for the night. Wall-E waits. Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape. Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground. Eve doesn't wake. Wall-E creeps up to her. Opens his arms wide... ...and measures her. Turns to a pile of trash. Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING \nEve powers up again. Does a double take. A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her. She hovers away, unimpressed. Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES. Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration. They roll on top of him. \nSONG ENDS \nMONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING \n- Scans a car engine. Negative. Slams the hood shut. \n- Scans a Port-A-Potty. Negative. Slams the door shut. \n- Scans an Apollo capsule. Negative. Slams the hatch shut. \n- Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD. \nNegative. Slams the lid shut. \nEXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK \nEVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] \nShe draws her gun on him. Doesn't understand the danger. The sandstorm rushes up behind her. Too late. Wall-E collapses into a box. The storm hits full force. Eve is instantly lost, disoriented. \nEVE Wall-E? Wall-E? \nWALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust. Calmly takes Eve's hand. \nINT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER \nThe back door lowers. A rush of wind and sand. Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door. She coughs up dust. \nWall-E hits a switch... Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space. His racks of oddities painted in colored light. \nAn air of enchantment. Eve is taken aback. \nWALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] \nShe drifts through the sea of knickknacks. Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH. Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down. He is compelled to show her everything. Hands her an eggbeater... ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)... ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)... ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)... ...his Hello Dolly tape. Curious, she begins unspooling the tape. \nWALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] \nHe grabs it back. Protective. Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work. The movie eventually appears on the TV. Plays a clip of POYSC. Wall-E is relieved. \nWALL-E (beeps) [What do you think?] \nMimics the dancing for Eve. Encourages her to try. She clumsily hops up and down. Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything. Wall-E politely stops her. \nWALL-E (beeps) [How `bout we try a different move?] \nSpins in a circle. Arms out. Eve copies. Spins faster, and faster... Too fast. Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves. \nEve helps him up from the mess. Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off. Dangles from two wires. Eve GASPS with concern. Wall-E placates her. \nWALL-E (beeps) [It's fine.] \nFeels his way to the rack of shelves. Rotates them until... ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear. Replaces his broken eye with a new one. Eve is relieved. \nShe eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION. Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME. Wall-E freezes. He had no idea it could do that. Moves closer to inspect it... \nON WALL-E \nIt's the closest he's ever been to Eve. She remains focused on the lighter. Wall-E stares up at her. ...The tiny flame flickering between them... ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background... Suddenly, he is moved to express his love. Musters the courage to open his fingers... ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers... \n-- Eve turns and looks at him. \nWall-E instantly chokes. Pulls his hand back. Eve becomes intrigued with the TV. Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM... Wall-E watches her. His infatuation still palpable. Then he remembers... \nWALL-E Ee-vah! \nHe rushes to his shelves. Eve watches him rummage through junk. A drum falls down on his head. She giggles, charmed by it all. Something about Wall-E... \nShe is drawn back to the lovers on TV... ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand. A tap on her shoulder. She turns to find Wall-E holding something. \nThe plant. \nEve immediately locks onto it. \nDrops the lighter. In a flash... ...her chest opens... ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away... ...stores it inside her... Then she shuts down completely. Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest. \nWall-E is stunned. What'd I do? Waves his hand in front of her face. \nWALL-E Ee-vah? \nKnocks on her chest plate. No response. Wall-E panics. Gently shakes her. \nBASE OF RECON SHIP \nThe engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE. Preparation for launch... \nINT. RECON SHIP \nEve is secured into a slot. Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES. All dormant. Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT. The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window... \nOUTSIDE THE SHIP \n...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side. The ship's engines ignite. Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support. The rocket takes off into space. \nEXT. TOP OF HILL \nThe cockroach watches his master go. \nEXT. RECON SHIP \nThe spaceship roars through the sky. Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's. He looks ahead. SCREAMS. \nHUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES \nlitter the outer atmosphere. The ship bursts through the layer. \nEXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS \nThe recon ship breaks free of the planet. Its boosters shut down. Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE. Looks back at his planet. \nWALL-E Oooh... \nWeightlessness takes effect. Wall-E almost floats away. Grabs hold of the ship. Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve. \nWALL-E E-vah! \nNo response. She remains shut down. Wall-E points out at the stars. It is the most spectacular light show possible. And Wall-E has a front row seat. \nMONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES \n- The ship flies past the MOON. A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER. \"BNL Outlet Coming Soon.\" \n- The ship passes by the SUN. Wall-E pops open his solar panels. \nInstantly recharges. \n- The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS. Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER \nA DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space. Wall-E is mesmerized by it. Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead. A planet? No. A starliner. Gigantic in size. \nThe \"AXIOM\". \nThe now tiny recon ship heads straight for it. \nINT. DOCKING BAY \nTWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in. It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck. The impact knocks Wall-E off. He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace. \nSuddenly the entire dock comes to life. Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear. ...Rise from the floor... ..Lower from the ceiling... It's a cacophony of automation. They all attend to the ship. \nEVE \nand four other probes slide out of the ship's side. Suspended in a horizontal rack. Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him. She remains shut down. Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them. \nON M-O'S DISPLAY \nReads: \"FOREIGN CONTAMINANT\" \nThe tracks lead to the elevator. M-O's neurosis takes over. Must clean dirt. He makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail. \nINT. ELEVATOR \nGopher waits patiently as the floors pass. Wall-E hidden behind the transport. Peeks at Eve. Pets her blank faceplate. \nWALL-E (quiet beeps) [It'll be okay, Eve.] \nThe ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open. \nINT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS \nDOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway. All following glowing lines on the floor. Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth. Tries to process it all. Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic... ...without him! \nWall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic. Timidly attempts to merge. Sticks out one tread... -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP. Wall-E boxes up. Guns it. Weaves across all the lines on the floor. Bounces off robots like bumper cars. \nBarely able to navigate the chaos. Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION. Scans for Eve... \nON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY \n...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign... ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute... ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp... \nWALL-E EE-VAH! \nWall-E chases after them. \nINT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWall-E flies up the ramp. Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR. It blocks his way. Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers \nA HUMAN PASSENGER \nsitting, reclined, in the chair. He is large, round and soft - like a big baby. Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit. The chair seems to be steering itself. Guided by floor lines, just like the robots. Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face. He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen: \nPASSENGER #1 Well, I've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space. \nPASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN) Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want to do that. \nPASSENGER #1 Well then what do you want to do? \nON WALL-E \nHe looks over his shoulder. Passenger #2 is floating right next to them. Isolated in his own hover chair. Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby. \nPASSENGER #2 I don't know. Something. \nBoth humans are totally unaware of the other's presence. They all exit the hallway. Merge into the... \nECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD \nWall-E is in awe. Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides. THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space. All reclined and riding on hover chairs. MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions. \nHumans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. Absolutely no reason to ever get up. No purpose. Every one of them engrossed in their video screens. Cocooned in virtual worlds. Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. The controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all... \n...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers: \nThe CHATTER is deafening. No one notices Wall-E at all. He drives into the endless human traffic. \nMISC. FEMALE PASSENGER Bot, over here! \nA DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger. Puts a fresh drink in her open hand. Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL. \nWall-E now notices his fellow passengers. They all slurp from similar cups. \nNext, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON. BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Feel beautiful. \nBEAUTICIAN-BOTS (pre-recorded lines) ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men... \nThey pass through the FASHION DISTRICT. ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's the new red! \nMONORAIL PASSENGERS Oooohh... \nPassengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons. Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE. \nWALL-E Whoa. \nTheir monorail speeds into a glass tunnel. \nINSIDE THE TUNNEL \nWall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him. Spots Eve on the other side. Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary. But her chair moves backwards. Smashes Wall-E against the back wall. No way getting past her. Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention. She's oblivious. Chats incessantly on her holo-screen: \nMARY Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me started! Every holo-date I've been on has been a virtual disaster! If I could just meet one who wasn't so superficial. There are no good men out there!... \nWall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest. Accidentally breaks it off. \nMARY (CONT'D) ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled through them all -- (Gasp) What the --? \nMary's chair shorts out. ...holo-screen shuts off... ...jumpsuit defaults back to red... For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view. Her eyes slowly dilate. It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time... \nMARY (mesmerized) Huh... ? \nHer gaze falls on Wall-E. He waves politely. \nWALL-E Wall-E. \nMARY (beat) M-mary. \nWALL-E Ee-vah. \nHe points to Eve on the other side of Mary. Gestures he'd like to get by. She is slow to understand. \nMARY Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead. \nMary moves her hover chair back. Wall-E rolls over to Eve. Pats her protectively. \nWALL-E Ee-vah... \nINT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY \nThe monorail emerges into \"First Class.\" A vast, circular plaza of pools. Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments. Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside. All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS. \nPOOLSIDE PASSENGER (claps; umbrella-bot opens) Shade. \nON MONORAIL \nIt stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA. \nThe base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower. The passengers exit. Follow their respective lines. Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower. Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor. \nON MARY \nShe is the last to exit the car. Doesn't follow any lines. Excited by her newfound awareness. Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away. \nAUTOPILOT Sir -- \nCAPTAIN Coffee. \nWall-E hides under the console just in time. \nThe Captain reaches for his coffee. Makes a minimal effort. Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward... ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee. \nAUTOPILOT Sir, the annual -- \nThe Captain gives Auto the hand. Sips his coffee. \nCAPTAIN Protocol, Auto. First things first. (to the room) Computer, status report. \nHis chair automatically arcs along the console. SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes. \nCAPTAIN                       SHIP'S COMPUTER (sips coffee)                   Unchanged...unchanged... Mechanical systems?...Reactor      unchanged...unchanged... core temperature?...Passenger      unchanged...unchanged... count?...Regenerative food         unchanged... buffet?...Jacuzzi Ph balance... Atmospheric conditions...laundry service volume... \nON WALL-E \nHe eyes Eve on the transport across the room. Has to get to her. But Auto is right above him. Can't move. \nAUTOPILOT Captain... \nAuto calls up a screen on the console. Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe. Waits patiently for the Captain to notice. Finally, the Captain turns... \nCAPTAIN Okay, Auto. \nAUTOPILOT Sir, the annual reconnaissance has -- \n...but then notices the time. \nCAPTAIN (disappointed sigh) Auto, why didn't you wake me for the morning announcements? \nHe slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge. Wall-E nearly collides with him. \nDucks back under the console. \nCAPTAIN Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship. \nGrabs a large dial. TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it. Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise. \nOUT ON LIDO DECK \n- The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE. - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS. - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up. \nAn ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom. A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN. Displays a live video feed of the Captain. The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN. \nCAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM) (unmotivated) Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be... (deflates) ...doing the exact same thing...they were doing... \nCut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING. The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain. \nCAPTAIN (INTERCOM) (snaps out of ennui) SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your free... (hard to pronounce) ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup. Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button? (mic feedback whine) \nBACK ON THE BRIDGE \nThe Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console. It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display. \nAUTOPILOT (O.S.) Captain? \nThe Captain turns to Auto. For the first time he notices Eve. Finally. Auto hovers over her. Salutes. \nAUTOPILOT Probe One has returned positive. \nCAPTAIN Positive? \nEVE (hushed; angry) [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You can't be here! You're going to get me in trouble!...] \nMakes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him. Wall-E just stares at her. Smitten. \nWALL-E (swoons) Ee-vah... \nON THE CAPTAIN \nHe manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS. \nCAPTAIN (reads aloud) Well, let's open her up. Step One. Voice command, \"Confirm Acquisition.\" \nSHIP'S COMPUTER Confirm Acquisition. \nThe bridge suddenly jumps to life. Green lights flash. A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling... ...Scans the entire room... ...Identifies Eve... ...Rides along the ceiling rails... ...Stations itself directly above Eve... ...Arms unfold. Position her... ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face: \nSHIP'S COMPUTER Voice authorization required. \nCAPTAIN ...Uh... \nSHIP'S COMPUTER Accepted. \nA BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers. Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve... Her chest lights up. The doors open. The Captain winces... \n...and nothing is inside. \nCAPTAIN Where's the thingie? \nAUTOPILOT Plant. \nCAPTAIN Plant. Right. Right. Where is it? (checks manual) Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you change the text again... \nAuto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual. Eve is stunned. Searches her chest cavity for the plant. Then she remembers... \nEVE Plant! Wall-E... (turns on him) Wall-E! \nWall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger. Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty. Picks him up. Scans the floor. Nothing. \nWALL-E Ee-vah? \nEVE (angry electronics) [Find it!] PLANT! \nWall-E scared of her. Starts searching. \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) Why don't you scan her to be sure. \nEve jumps back to attention. Auto slides up to her. Scans her chest cavity. \nAUTOPILOT Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is faulty. \nCAPTAIN So, then...we're NOT going to Earth? \nAUTOPILOT (shakes his wheel) Negative. \nCAPTAIN So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh? \nAUTOPILOT Correct, Captain. \nCAPTAIN (privately relieved) Well, false alarm! \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) False alarm. \nInstantly the plant retrieval device retracts. Exits back into the ceiling. The shades rise. Lights go back on. \nCAPTAIN The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward. \nThe orderly-arms now start on Wall-E. He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him. Races through the ward. Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT. \nBEAUTICIAN-BOT (pre-recorded) Just a trim? Uh huh. \nShe paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up. Holds up a mirror. Wall-E gasps. \nBEAUTICIAN-BOT You look gorgeous. \nWall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm. Placed in an empty force field pen. Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT: ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E... ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face... Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly. Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET. \nEve slides past Wall-E. Carried by an orderly-arm. Brought into the \"DIAGNOSTICS\" ROOM. The frosted glass doors shut. \nWALL-E Ee-vah! \nINT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM \nOrderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots: \n- An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends. The orderly-arms struggle to close it. \n- A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY. It bursts into flames. \nEve is awoken from \"sleep\" mode. A series of tests begin. Eve is annoyed but calm. It's all routine. An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm. \nOUT IN THE REPAIR WARD \nWall-E stares at the frosted glass doors. Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE. To him, her arm is being ripped off. \nWALL-E Ee-vah! \nBACK INSIDE WITH EVE \nThe orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry. Her insides light up. It tickles. \nEVE (Giggles) \nNext to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES. \nOUTSIDE WITH WALL-E \nWall-E watches in horror. It looks as if Eve is being tortured. Mistakes the screeching for her screams. Wall-E struggles to free himself. \nINSIDE WITH EVE \nShe is washed and scrubbed. A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body. It feels good. \nBACK ON WALL-E \nIt looks as if Eve is being beheaded. He needs to stop the torture. Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field. The barrier shorts out. Wall-E tumbles to the floor. Lands on his \"Play\" button. POYSC blares across the ward. The Rejects all stop and stare. \nWALL-E EEEEEEVAAAAHH!! \nWall-E races to the diagnostics room. Crashes right through the glass doors. Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms. Grabs Eve's separated gun arm. Points it at the orderly-arms. \nWALL-E (angry beeps) [Let her go, or I'll shoot!] \nHis hands tremble, Don Knotts-style. Doesn't realize... \n...he's holding the gun backwards. \nEve slowly reaches for the weapon. \nEVE (\"Put the gun down...\") Wall-E... \nAn orderly lunges at him. Wall-E panics. Shoots! The gun fires backwards. It blasts through the repair ward. \nShe can see the DOCKING BAY below her. Just under the bay doors... \n...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS. \nEve gets an idea. Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway... \nINSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER \nEve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence. Their \"WANTED\" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN) Caution: Rogue robots. \nWall-E points to it. \nWALL-E (beeps) [Hey look! We're on TV -- !] \nEve aims her gun at the screen. Blows it to pieces. Wall-E shrinks into a box. Never mind. \nINT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY \nDark. The elevator chimes. Eve and Wall-E step out. Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway. Eve approaches \"Bay #1\". She and Wall-E enter... \nINT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS \nEve navigates the dark. Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE. Fiddles with some buttons. \nON WALL-E \nHe glances down at EVE'S HAND. Privately intertwines his fingers. Maybe now is the right moment... \nWALL-E (quiet) Ee-vah...? \nFLASH! Banks of controls light up around them. \nAN ESCAPE POD \nis revealed at the end of the room. Its hatch automatically opens. Bathes the room with light from its lit interior. Eve turns to Wall-E: \nEVE Earth. \nShe points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN. It displays coordinates to Earth. \nEVE Earth. \nShe gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod. He happily complies. Jumps up on one of the seats. Pats the seat next to him. Aren't you coming? \nEve remains at the threshold. Shakes her head. Points to her chest. Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow. \nEVE Directive. \n...She's not going. \nThis changes everything. Wall-E races out of the pod. Boxes up. \nWALL-E (beeps) [Then I'm not going either.] \nEve shakes her head. \nEVE (gentle, but firm) Wall-E. \nCarries his box back into the pod. Exits. Wall-E follows her right back out. Drives behind the console. You can't make me. Eve sighs. \nEVE (frustrated) Wall-E. \nThe hallway elevator CHIMES. They both look up. Someone is coming. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Ten seconds till self-destruct... \nWall-E panics. Looks for a means of escape. Spots the hatch. Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Shoots himself to the door. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... \nPulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER. The hatch won't open! \nON EVE \nShe races through space after him. Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES. \nEve is gut-punched. \nEVE No, no, no... \nShe flies towards the debris field, when -- \nWall-E whizzes right past her. \nWALL-E Ee-vaaaaaah! \nHe holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Uses it as a form of propulsion. Eve is consumed with relief. Chases after him. \nON WALL-E \nHe points the extinguisher the other way. Attempts to fly back over to her. It's hard to steer... \n...They rocket right past each other again... \nWALL-E (beeps) [Stay there! I'll come to you!] \nEve waits. Wall-E finally has the hang of steering. Fires short bursts. Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve. Gets extinguisher foam in her face. She giggles. \nWALL-E (\"Look what I've got\") Ee-vah... \nHe opens his compactor door. Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot. \nEVE (Gasp!) \nON EVE'S DISPLAY POV \n...Sensors zero in on the plant... ...Confirm its authenticity... ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears... ...Draws directions to the bridge... ...A command flashes: \"DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR\"... \nEve is ecstatic. She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam. Seals it safely in her chest. Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms. Spins him around. \nEVE Wall-E! (Laughs) \nWall-E can't believe his luck. Rests his head on her shoulder. Bliss. \nEve stops spinning. Leans her head against his. A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them. A \"thank you\" kiss. \nWall-E's METER spikes. He floats circles in space. \nWALL-E (swoons) \nEVE (hums) [Come on. Time's a wastin'.] \nShe reaches for his hand. Wall-E shakes his head. Holds up his extinguisher instead. \nWALL-E (beeps) [I can fly myself.] \nKicks on the extinguisher. Spins in a pirouette... ...and flies away. Eve giggles. Chases after him. \nBING CROSBY'S \"STARDUST\" PLAYS \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) \"Hoedown\" - a social gathering at which lively dancing would take place. \nAn aperture opens in the ceiling above. Auto lowers down to face the Captain. \nCAPTAIN Auto! Earth is amazing! (points to images) These are called \"farms\". Humans would put seeds in the ground, pour water on them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza -- \nAuto shuts off the holo-screen. \nAUTOPILOT Good night, Captain. \nCAPTAIN (annoyed grunt) \nAuto rises back up to the bridge. The aperture shuts. Lights out. The Captain glares at the ceiling. Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer. \nCAPTAIN Psst! Computer. (the holo-screen lights up) Define \"dancing\". \nBACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM \nEve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side. Spiral gracefully around one another. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) \"Dancing\" - A series of movements, involving two partners, where speed and rhythm match harmoniously with music. \nWall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam. He lets it float freely out into space. Eve catches him in her arms. Wall-E croons. \nSONG ENDS \nEve scans the Axiom for a way in. Notices SPARKS. Down on the ship's lower hull... \nCLOSER ON LOWER HULL \nA REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna. Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him. It shuts. Burn-e bangs on the closed door. Stuck outside. \nBURN-E (beeps) [Hey! Let me in! Let me in!] (looks around) [Crap.] \nINT. LIDO DECK - NIGHT \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido Deck is now closing. \nThe last few passengers exit the pool area. All wearing the same color blue uniforms... \n...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool. \nCLOSE ON FEET \nThey ripple the surface of the pool. John and Mary float over the water's surface. Splash one another playfully. \nJOHN Hey now. Stop that... \nMARY Make me (giggles). \nJOHN I didn't know we had a pool. \nA LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower. Reprimands them from the pool's edge: \nLIFEGUARD-BOT No splashing, no diving. \nJOHN & MARY (annoyed) Ahh! Go on! \nJohn splashes the robot. It shorts out. \nON UPPER DECK \nEve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck. Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS. Eve peeks through the towels. Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS. On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance. No way in. \nA TRASH-BOT passes. Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE. Eve keys in on the chute. It runs all the way up the tower... \nThe CEO races out of the room. The message cuts out. \nAuto turns to face the Captain. The Captain shakes his head in disgust. \nAUTOPILOT Now, the plant. \nCAPTAIN No, wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom? \nThe paused image on the holo-screen highlights. Data begins to calculate on the screen. We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS. It stops on \"2110\". \nSHIP'S COMPUTER Message received in the year 2110. \nCAPTAIN That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back! \nAUTOPILOT Sir, orders are: \"Do not return to Earth\". \nCAPTAIN But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong. \nAUTOPILOT Irrelevant, Captain. \nCAPTAIN What?! It's completely relevant! (points out to space) Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!! \nAUTOPILOT On the Axiom you will survive. \nCAPTAIN I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE! \nAUTOPILOT Must follow my directive. \nCAPTAIN DAAAARGH!! \nThe Captain turns away in frustration. His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS. Notices AUTO in every one of them. Looking over all their shoulders. A little closer every generation. The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder... ...and Auto is right behind him. The Captain looks at the plant in his lap. His countenance grows determined. He rights his hat... ...turns to face Auto... ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career: \nCAPTAIN I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today! \nAuto slides into his face. Makes the Captain flinch. No more Mr. Nice Robot. Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND. \nGOPHER \nshoots out of a pneumatic tube. Salutes Auto. Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay. She BEEPS a warning to the Captain. \nCAPTAIN Gopher? \nGopher activates his suspension beam. \nSnatches the plant away from the Captain. \nCAPTAIN Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny! (to Eve) Eve, arrest him! \nEve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher. The robot raises his epaulet arms. Don't shoot! She opens her chest cavity. Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her. \nCAPTAIN Eve, you are to put this plant straight in the Holo-detector. \nGopher slowly advances towards Eve. But then tosses the plant across the room... \n...down the TRASH CHUTE. \nCAPTAIN No! \nEVE (hums) [Oh no!] \nIt's over. The plant is gone. But in that frozen moment... \nON TRASH CHUTE \n...THE PLANT suddenly reappears. Rises like a ghost, up from the chute. Wall-E's head follows. Unawares of the plant resting on his head. \nThe exterior hatch flies open. The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash. \nEve begins to panic. Calls out again: \nEVE Wall-E! \nSuddenly, her area is flooded in light. She flinches at the sight of \nTWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS \nas they rumble up behind her. Headlights for eyes. They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E. \"WALL-A\" emblazoned on their fronts. Each grab a ton of trash at once. Eve is swept up with the junk. Compact it. Spit it out... \n...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube. \nHer cube is picked up. Transported to a waiting platform. Stacked with other massive cubes. Eve discovers... \n...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her. \nEVE Wall-E! \nHe groans. Not doing well. \nAgain the alarms kick in. The platform slides on rails... ...across the safety line... ...into the airlock... ...the inner shield doors begin to close... \nINSIDE THE AIRLOCK \nEve needs to act fast. Her gun arm stuck inside the cube. Struggles to activate it... ...It cocks. BLASTS herself free. Flies over to Wall-E. He's stuck deep in the cube... \nBACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT \nM-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute. Lands in a pile of trash. Covered with filth. \nM-O [Primal scream.] \nON M-O'S DISPLAY POV \nPiles of trash everywhere. The airlock doors closing in the distance. \nZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E. His screen reads: \"FOREIGN CONTAMINANT\". \nM-O (beeps) [I have you now!] \nM-O speeds towards the airlock. \nON EVE \nTugs on Wall-E. Desperate to free him. He's slow to pull loose... \n...THE GAP in the doors narrows... \n...Eve's never going to make it... \nON M-O \nRacing towards the doors. He's almost at the airlock... The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms. M-O is stuck. \nThe exterior hatch opens: ...Eve yanks Wall-E free... ...The trash flies out into space... ...She flies against the force... ...Fights to reach M-O... ...Grabs onto his roller... \nINSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT \nThe WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door. Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock. The exterior hatch closes. \nEve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap. Safe. M-O still stuck in the door. Shaking uncontrollably with fear. \nM-O Whoa. \nA steward moves down the hall. Siren wailing. Scans for rogue robots. Eve and Wall-E's \"Warning\" image on his display screen. He stops in front of... \nA YELLOW LINE \npainted haphazardly on the floor. Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door. \nSTEWARD Wrong. \nThe steward opens the closet. Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner. The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush. The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM. \nSuddenly, everything begins to shake. The steward looks around, confused. A JET ENGINE NOISE builds. Seems to be coming from... \n...the hallway TRASH CHUTE. \nEve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it. The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E. Beeps the POYSC song. Our savior has arrived! The steward's alarm goes haywire. \nON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY \nHe takes a snapshot: Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant... \n...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera. \nANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe terrified steward is thrown in. \nSTEWARD Please hold. We are currently having technical difficul -- ! \nEve locks the door on him. The trio take off down the hall. The freed paint-bot gives chase. Cheers POYSC as he follows. Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea. Presses his PLAY BUTTON. POYSC BLARES through the hallway. \nON VARIOUS HALLWAYS \nREJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music. Parade after Eve and Wall-E. Hum POYSC. All following the pied piper. \nON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM \nEve and Wall-E's \"Wanted\" image instantly circulates. Alarms sound. Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots... \nINT. BRIDGE \nAuto observes the same \"Wanted\" image. \nAUTO Not possible. \nRaises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM. It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location. Auto activates every steward on the Axiom. \nON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT \nStewards eject from their wall stations. Like ATMs jumping to life. Race in the direction of Eve. Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way. \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) ...Caution: Rogue Robots... \nBACK ON THE BRIDGE \nAuto watches the deck plan display. Monitors the progress of all the stewards. The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to... \nTHE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS \nThe Captain, still trapped. Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door. Has no effect. \nCAPTAIN (hoarse; exhausted) Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your last chance...Auto...You hear me?...Stupid...wheel... \nSHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) ...Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots... \nON LIDO DECK \nThe holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor... Wall-E is still hanging onto it. Barely functioning. He uses all his strength... \n...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector. \nStops it from disappearing into the floor. The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box. \nON BRIDGE \nThe holo-detector button buzzes and flashes. Something's wrong. Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW. Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device. \nAUTO No. \nAuto presses down on the \"off\" button. \nON WALL-E \nThe holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him. Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up. Begins slowly to expand himself... \n...and push the holo-detector back up!! \nON BRIDGE \nThe Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen. Auto flips out his TASER. Jams it into the \"off\" button. Short circuits it. \nCAPTAIN NO!! \nBACK ON WALL-E \nThe holo-detector reverses full force. Crushes Wall-E. We can't tell if he survived the crush. \nEve calls out for him. Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers. \nBACK ON BRIDGE \nThe Captain watches Wall-E being crushed. That's it. He braces his arms against the floor... \n...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET... \nON JUMBOTRON SCREEN \nThe passengers collectively GASP. Their Captain is standing... ...and walking himself up the railing... ...towards Auto! They CHEER! \nON BRIDGE \nAuto hears the distant cheering. Wonders what's up. \nCAPTAIN (O.S.) Auto! \nAuto whips around. Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly). Finds himself face to face with him. Auto flips out his TASER. Rushes at him. The Captain grabs it. They wrestle. The taser ARCS in the Captain's face. He flinches. Looks up. Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column... \n...and smirks. \nThe Captain looks Auto in the eye. Raises a finger up to the control panel... ...to the \"AUTOPILOT\" BUTTON... ...and flicks the switch to \"MANUAL\". \nCAPTAIN (grits his teeth) Auto, you are relieved of duty. \nAUTO Noo -- \nAuto is instantly turned off. The Captain smiles triumphantly. Grabs the wheel with both hands. Makes the ship level again. \nON LIDO DECK \nThe passengers all spill across the deck. Shaken but OK. Eve sets the monorail down. Rockets over to the holo-detector. \nA RED DOT \nappears on the ground. The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside. The ground begins to shake. Daylight dims. The insect looks to the sky. \nON CLOUD COVER \nA DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds. Blots out the sunlight. The Axiom's keel breaks through. Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape. \nThe cockroach senses his master's return. HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him. He eagerly chases after them. \nON AXIOM \nThe city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky. Pushes back the clouds to the horizon. \nEXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT \nThe CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth. Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT. Thousands of feet deep. The ship's keel descends into it. The earth shudders. Trash towers tumble in the distance. \n...Then all is quiet. \nON BELLY OF THE AXIOM \nA ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship. MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend. Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port. \nThe Captain walks out gingerly. Holding the boot w/ plant. The other passengers step out on their own legs. Wobble like toddlers. They squint up at the harsh sunlight. A commotion is heard from the back. Somebody trying to push through. \nEVE \nappears out of the crowd. Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms. \nM-O and the Rejects follow behind her. They rush across the gangway. \nThe cockroach meets up with Eve. Climbs up onto Wall-E. Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. Eve urgently scans the landscape. Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance. She takes to the air. M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway. \nM-O (beeps) [Eve! Wait!] \nThe Captain respectfully removes his hat. Good luck, friend. \nINT. WALL-E'S TRUCK \nThe interior is dark and still. Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. Eve flies inside with Wall-E. Sets him on the floor. \nShe scans the rotating shelves at high speed. Grabs a CAR JACK. Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body... \nQUICK SHOTS \n...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve... ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E... ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece... ...She opens his new solar panels... \n...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun. \nOUT ON THE EMPTY BAY \nThe rejects stop. See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode. Oh no. \nBACK IN THE TRUCK \nA shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E. Eve holds her breath, watches... Waits... \n...Beep... ...Beep... \nWALL-E (O.S.) (Apple \"reboot\" SFX) \nWall-E's meter fully charges. His head slowly rises from his box. Blinks. The cockroach hops with joy. Eve is relieved. \n...She holds out her hand to him. \n", "test1_input": "The morning sun. Wall-E fully exposed in its light. His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield. A solar collector. \nHis CHARGE METER chimes full. Solar panels fold away into hiding. Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler. Heads off to work. ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach. Horrified, Wall-E reverses. \nReveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread. The cockroach simply pops back to life. No biggie. Ready to go. Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute. \nEXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING \nA SERIES OF \"WALL-E AT WORK\" MOMENTS: \n- CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage. CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor. A cube lands by the cockroach. \n- Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage. Unsure what it's for. Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses. Tosses it in his cooler. \n- Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS. Presses the remote lock. Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS. \n- Plays with a paddle ball. The ball keeps smacking him in the face. He doesn't like it. \n- Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE. Throws out the ring. Keeps the case. The jewel case drops into the cooler, then... ...A RUBBER DUCKY... ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL... ...An OLD BOOT... ...A TROPHY... \n- Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Activates it. FOAM blasts in his face. It's tossed far, far away from his cooler. \n- Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid. Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself. Now what? \n- CU on fridge door. A WELDING BEAM moves down its center. It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES. \nThe door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals... \n...a SMALL PLANT \nin its early stage of growth. Wall-E is entranced. Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it. \nCLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER \nWall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot. Dusts dirt off the leaves. \nEXT. TRUCK - DUSK \nRobot and faithful cockroach return home. Wall-E stops short of the threshold. Stares at the ground. Continues staring. \nA RED DOT \nquivers on the dirt. A single laser point of light. Wall-E moves to touch it... \n...The dot races along the ground. \nWall-E drops his Igloo. Chases after the dot. \nEXT. EMPTY BAY \nThe dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse. He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice \nMANY LASER POINTS \ncoming from every direction. All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain. Triangulating towards a center. \nWall-E's dot suddenly stops. Slowly he reaches for it. Can't grab it. Just light. ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him. The ground shakes. Wall-E becomes confused. \nDoesn't see above him. The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover. A noise. Building. \nRocket engines. Wall-E senses he should look to the sky. \nNow THREE SUNS are descending on him. \nWall-E runs for it. An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path. A second column of fire. A third. Trapped. \n", "test1_true": "...Then suddenly quiet. Smoke clears. \nCLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH \nWall-E's head rises out of the dirt. Glows red hot from the heat. Trembles with fright. Everything in shadow. Something very big looms over him. Wall-E climbs out of his hole. Bangs his head on metal. \nWIDE on a massive SPACESHIP. Rests ominously in the empty bay. \nA PORTAL on its underside opens. Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide. Nowhere to go. He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up. \nA DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem. Scans the surface. \nWall-E creeps closer for a better look. The device unfolds. Wall-E boxes up again. \nA CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem. ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device. Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons. The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal... \n...a PROBE ROBOT. \nIt hovers gracefully above the ground. White. Egg-shaped. \nBlue-lit eyes. Female. Eve. \nWall-E is transfixed. Inches closer. Watches Eve from behind the device. Tilts his head. Time stops. She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. \nEve hovers over the ground. A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel. Fans out 180 degrees. Scans random objects and areas. \nThe device rises back into the ship. Exposes Wall-E. He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock. Never takes his eyes off Eve. Watches her float away from the ship. ...from the ship? The ship! \nEngines roar back to life. Wall-E digging furiously. The rocket takes off. \nSmoke clears. Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground. Looks for Eve. She is watching the ship rise into the clouds. Waits until it is completely out of sight... \n...then Eve rises high up into the air. \nShe flies around the bay. Soars like a graceful bird. Does loops in the sky. Zooms right past Wall-E's rock. He is hypnotized. \nEve descends gently to the ground... Wall-E sneaks up closer. Hides behind another boulder. Slips. Makes a NOISE. Instantly, Eve whips around. Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON. Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens. \n...Smoke clears...All quiet. \nEve, now cold and dangerous. \nScans the area. No sign of life. All business again. Hovers away to probe more of the planet. \nON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER \nWall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock. Trembles uncontrollably. \nEXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY \nEve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash. Scans random areas. Wall-E spies from the shadows. Too frightened to approach. She moves on. He follows. \nEXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY \nEve probes a mound of tires. Wall-E hiding nearby. He flinches at the sight of \nHIS COCKROACH \ninnocently approaching Eve from behind. She spins around. Blasts the insect. Wall-E is gut-punched. \nThe cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater. Unscathed. Still curious. \nEve finds the insect intriguing. Lowers her arm. The end separates into individual hovering sections... \n", "test1_id": 564, "test2_input": "HIS FOOT \nIt's tapping in time to the music. His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands. He lifts it up. Makes the boot dance. \nCAPTAIN ...You made it somehow, eh little guy? You didn't give up, did you? \nAs if in response, the plant wilts slightly. A leaf drops. \nCAPTAIN (Gasp!) Oh no, no -- (remembers) Wait a minute. \nThe Captain urgently hovers across the room. Eve left alone. Her recorded memories continue playing... \n...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment. \nEve recognizes the music. Watches the lovers on screen hold hands. Something familiar about the gesture... Looks at her own hands. Slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...Eve's eyes go wide. This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her. \nHer memories continue on the screen: ...a tap on the shoulder... ...Wall-E presents her the plant -- ...The screen goes BLACK! \nThen... \n...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates. \nWall-E's vigil for Eve plays out: ...protecting her from the rain... ...the sun...the sandstorm... ...keeping watch night and day... ...trying to jump start her heart... \nON EVE \nAmazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her. Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love. \nEVE (soft) Wall-E... \nShe looks at her hands again. \nMATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS \nStill waiting between the towel racks. Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve. \nWALL-E Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah... (gives up; beeps) [I'll never get it right.] \nBecomes impatient. Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE. Sticks his head in. \nWALL-E EE-VAHH?! \nNo answer. The chute has an endless drop. Wall-E climbs in. \nHolds himself spread eagle to stay in place. Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters... \nOUT ON THE UPPER DECK \nA monorail pulls up. M-O steps off. Still hot on Wall-E's trail. Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby. Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS... \n...leading to the trash chute. \nM-O (beeps) [Ah-hah! Gotcha!] \nBACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS \nThe Captain at his wet bar. Waters the plant in the sink. \nCAPTAIN There you go little guy. You came a long way for a drink of water... Just needed someone to look after you, that's all -- \nHe is struck with a notion. Stares out the window at space for a beat. Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.

She turns to leave and finds \nAUTO \nlowering in front of her. Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand. \"A113\" flashes on Auto's lens. \nCAPTAIN Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector. \nAUTOPILOT Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me. \nCAPTAIN (not listening) You know what? I should do it myself. \nHeads for the elevator. \nAUTOPILOT Captain! \nAuto shoots back upstairs. Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator. Blocks the Captain. \nAUTOPILOT Sir, I insist you give me the plant. \nCAPTAIN Auto, get out of my way. \nAUTOPILOT Sir, we cannot go home. \nCAPTAIN What are you talking about? Why not? \nAUTOPILOT That is classified. Captain, give me the plant. \nCAPTAIN (holds plant out of reach) What do you mean, \"classified\"?

Beat. \nAUTOPILOT Aye-aye, sir. \nAuto rises back into the ceiling. Lowers down over the vanity console. High speed button pushing. A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears. Labeled: \"TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY\". The BNL FANFARE plays. Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium. Haggard. Nervous. Wears an emergency oxygen vest. The fanfare plays too long. \nBUY N LARGE CEO (to O.S.) Just cut it off, will ya?! (music stops; forced chuckle) Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well... failed! Wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on Earth. \nCAPTAIN Unsustainable? What? \nBUY N LARGE CEO Darn it all, we're going to have to cancel Operation Recolonize. (dons his life vest) So just, uh...just stay the course.

The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E. Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself. \nCAPTAIN Ha ha! \nHEARS AUTO coming. Turns off the vid-com. \nYanks his bundle of wires out of the wall. The room goes dark again. \nCLOSE ON CEILING \nThe aperture opens. Auto lowers into the dark. Cautiously searches the empty room... \nAUTO Captain? Captain...? \nON AUTO'S POV \nPANS across the portraits of other captains... ...past our present Captain... ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously... -- wait a minute. \nThe Captain lunges at him. Grabs Auto by the steering wheel. Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale. His lower extremities of no use. \nAUTO Let go. Let go. \nAuto panics. Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling. The Captain gets stuck between floors... \nCAPTAIN What too heavy for ya, huh?! \nUP ON THE BRIDGE \n...Auto tries to pull free. The Captain won't let go. Auto ends up yanking him through. The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco. Auto swings violently back and forth. \nCAPTAIN You're not getting away from me, one-eye! -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?! \nGopher drops out of his pneumatic tube. Sees the Captain fighting Auto. Charges at the Captain... \n...who kicks him straight out the window... \nON LIDO DECK \nGopher plummets... ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL... ...and smashes in a heap on the cement. The end. \nON WALL-E AND EVE \nWe PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards. The massage-bot floats above it all. Pants like a wild beast. One steward still twitches. The massage-bot crushes him with one blow. \nEve grabs Wall-E and the plant. They take off for the Concourse Level. M-O and the Rejects follow behind. \nON THE BRIDGE \nCAPTAIN That's it!...A little closer! Must..press...button. \nThe Captain reaches his one free hand out for... ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. \nCAPTAIN Gotcha! Ha ha! \nHis hand slams down hard on it. KLAXONS sound all over the ship. \nVARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM \n", "test3_true": "The procedure is completely automated. The passengers are all confused. Helpless to stop it. \nINT. LIDO DECK \nThe passengers glide in by the thousands. Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools. Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides. \nON JOHN AND MARY \nThey arrive together at the Lido Deck. Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying. A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them. \nNANNY-BOT Remain calm. Remain calm. \nCLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA \nThe BNL LOGO on the floor rotates. A large cylindrical device rises from the stage... \n...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR. \nJUMBOTRONS activate on the dome. Show the bridge. Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto. He tries to speak to them during the fight: \nCAPTAIN (strained; in command) Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your Captain speaking! We're having a slight malfunction with the Autopilot! Please remain calm! \nThe passengers get caught up in the conflict. Treat it as if it were a televised fight. \nON THE REAR OF THE DECK \nEve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel. Make a beeline for the holo-detector. Ready and waiting for the plant... \n...almost there... \nON BRIDGE \nAUTO Enough. \nAuto furiously spins his wheel. Throws the Captain to the floor. The entire ship lists dangerously to one side. \nON LIDO DECK \nEve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side. Wall-E drops the plant. It tumbles off the bridge plaza. Eve is forced to set Wall-E down. \nHe clings to the holo-detector. She flies off to retrieve the plant. \nThe hover chairs stay locked on their lines. Passengers all slip off their chairs. Their uniform color defaults back to RED. Slowly slide across the deck. And for the first time... ...all of humanity reaches out to one another. CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands. \nEveryone piles up on the listing side. The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity. Eve searches desperately amongst them. \nON JOHN & MARY \nThey hang together off their chairs. CRYING TODDLERS just above them. The kiddies slip out of their hover rings. Mary GASPS in horror. Yells to John: \nMARY John, get ready to have some kids! \nThey purposefully let go of their chairs. Grab hands, forming a human chain. Catch the toddlers. All slide together down the Lido Deck. The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down. They land at the bottom, next to Eve. \nAn empty monorail car tips off the upper deck... ...lands on the pool level. It begins sliding down the Lido Deck. Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake. \nMARY (Gasp) LOOK OUT! \nEve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them. She stops   the car before it hits. Struggles   to hold it up. Can't let   it crush the passengers below her. \nON BRIDGE \nAuto keeps the ship tilted. Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. Switches it off. \n", "test3_id": 566}

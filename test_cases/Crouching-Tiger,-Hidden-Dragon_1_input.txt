EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass. 
EXT. CLIFF - DAY 
Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff.  Lo looks over, viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him.  They see a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance. 
LO Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer. 
JEN Let them look. 
LO It is trouble for me. 
Jen bites her lip. 
JEN Don't send me back! 
LO You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true." 
INT. TENT - DAY 
Jen and Lo kiss.  Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair and presses it into his palm.  Jen starts to cry.  They embrace. 
JEN Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again. 
LO I will. 
JEN (smiling painfully) If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy. 
EXT. TENT - DAY 
Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning light. 
End of flashback. 
INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
LO Wherever I went, someone always recognized me.  I really tried. Later, I heard you came to Peking. I was afraid I'd never see you again.  So I came.  I can't let you marry. 
Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from outside the door. 
JEN (whispering) Go. 
LO Jen...

Zimmer, his guards, and George - still dressed as a musketeer - come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious- looking people are waiting. They sit down and Zimmer, very proudly and self-confidently, gestures to an assistant who passes on the message to the projectionist. The room goes dark. The screening begins. 
INT. VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY 
On screen we see a card that indicates it's a sound shooting test for a talking scene. Then Constance appears, the actress from the spy film. She's standing in front of a mic and she tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the audience can hear her. It is however, awful. 
(31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by what they see/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's pride seems to grow by the second. 
George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the actress earnestly ends her monologue. 
When the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room, waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face. 
33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33 
We're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his dressing room! 
34   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     34 
Noisy, laughing dancers pass in the corridor, others are talking or shouting and even if we can't make out what they are saying, they are all making sound. George tries to talk to them but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright, bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly loud... 
35   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - COURTYARD - DAY                   35 
...and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now suddenly deserted and silent. In front of him a feather eddies slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands, making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion. George screams, but again his cry is silent.

MAN Why don't you get comfortable? 
She smiles coyly and starts to undress. He crosses to the closed blinds. 
MAN (continuing) There's a wonderful moon out tonight. 
He opens the blinds, revealing Cole's ass pressed up against the window. 
WOMAN 
She screams, horrified. 
INT. JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN'S ROOM 
The girls are being hotly pursued by the Japanese men. 
JAPANESE/RAY (subtitled) Hey, Bob, this beats the shit out of sushi, doesn't it? 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
The bed moves right up against the wall under the window. We SEE the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie. 
COLE 
He's panicked. 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
The knot unties. 
COLE 
He falls OUT OF FRAME. The "rope" trailing behind. 
INT. CAR 
The young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar. He's cranking open the sun roof. 
MAN Babe, I didn't know anything about that. 
The sun roof opens. Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it. The Woman freaks out again. 
EXT. SPORTSCAR 
We SEE a groggy Cole sitting in the sun roof. The Man in the car is trying to calm down his lady. 
INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE 
Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle. Then: 
MC All right, can we have our five finalists, please. 
CHULO Good luck, Laverne. 
Laverne and the five finalists go out on stage. 
ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON 
He gives an envelope to the MC. 
MC Thank you, Mr. Thomerson. Well, the judges have made their decision, and this year's Miss Moosehead Beer is... 
ANGLE - THE GIRLS 
They are all nervous, especially Laverne. 
MC Laverne Rivas. 
Laverne squeals with delight and hugs the MC as he puts the bejeweled crown on her head. Then the MC leads her to the microphone. 
LAVERNE (teary-eyed) I can't believe it. This is the happiest day of my life, and I owe it all to him. 
She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes, comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne up off her feet and hugs her passionately. 
ANGLE - THE JUDGES 
JUDGE I know I've had that girl. 
MR. THOMERSON (looking at Chulo) And I know that guy from somewhere, too. 
The other judge looks at Mr. Thomerson suspiciously. 
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
CAMERA PUSHES IN TO a car in the parking lot which is towing a U-Haul trailer behind it. The car stops and turns off its lights.

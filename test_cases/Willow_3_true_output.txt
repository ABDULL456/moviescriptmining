EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY 
The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and Willow gallop inside. 
INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY 
Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE PILLARS which look like stone from a distance. 
RAZIEL Tir Asleen. 
WILLOW There's nobody here. 
They approach the twelve pillars. 
RAZIEL The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The king's bravest warriors. 
Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry. 
EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY 
Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample across the valley of flowers. 
INT. TIR ASLEEN 
Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to shut it. 
RAZIEL Turn them back, Willow! 
Willow stares at the twelve knights. 
WILLOW How?? 
RAZIEL Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them! 
The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to- ward him. 
Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints and strains, concentrating his energy. 
WILLOW Beings within, beings without! Danu danu walkail funfawtha! 
He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the knights comes to life. 
WILLOW I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it! 
RAZIEL More!  More! 
Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt. 
EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY 
The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door. 
KAEL Assault!  Scale the walls! 
He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods. 
INT. TIR ASLEEN 
Willow brings the knights to life, one by one. 
WILLOW Tuatha tuatha danu! 
Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan follows them in an armory. 
WILLOW Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician! 
RAZIEL You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me. 
Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together. 
WILLOW I feel like I could do anything! 
He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's stone apart like an accordian. 
EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY 
Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor. Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements. Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com- plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out to touch it. 
KNIGHT It belonged to our king.

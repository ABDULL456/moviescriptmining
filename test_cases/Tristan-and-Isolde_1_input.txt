ISOLDE My Lord. 
MARKE Isolde? Welcome. 
[He takes her hand and everyone claps] 
[Isoldes wedding gown is prepared. Marke puts on his metal hand for the ceremony. Isolde  fully dressed- floats down the river to the wedding ceremony about a decorated ship. She and Marke go forward to be wed. There is a celebration after the wedding. As Isolde and Marke leave the party, Isolde approaches Tristan] 
ISOLDE If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me? 
TRISTAN That place does not exist. 
ISOLDE I'll pretend it's you. 
[Isolde and Marke retire to their bedroom. Tristan watches their window from outside] 
MARKE Youre trembling. You are far from home and I am a stranger still. But you mustnt fear me. My wish is to make you happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am not whole will not offend you. 
[Marke kisses Isolde and makes love to her] 
[Marke and Isolde stand outside the keep surveying the town. Mark fingers her shell bracelet] 
MARKE Thats pretty. Did you make it? 
ISOLDE It was a present. 
[Tristan goes to Edyths home and knocks on the door] 
MAN Tristan? 
TRISTAN Might I stay here a while? 
MAN Of course. 
[There is a montage of Tristan and Isoldes lives while in Dor. Finally in the marketplace Isolde is fed food by Mark and they laugh together. Edyth sees Tristan watching]

INTERVIEWER (O.C.) What was the conflict? 
JIM LANGE Look, it's water under the bridge.     I'm not gonna talk about it. 
INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
The previously bare room is now filled with lovely and expensive furnishings. But Barris and Penny are again on the floor, now playing Scrabble by candlelight. Penny lays down some tiles: I-N-T-E-R-P-E-T 
BARRIS The word's interpret. 
PENNY Interpet. 
BARRIS Interpret. 
PENNY Well, do you have an extra "r" then I could borrow? 
BARRIS I'm not going to give you a letter. You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a turn. 
PENNY Oh.   Okay. 
Penny retrieves her letters and studies the board. Barris empties the wine into Penny's glass. There wasn't much left. 
BARRIS I'll run to the store and get some more. 
PENNY All right. 
BARRIS Don't cheat. 
PENNY You neither. 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Barris pulls up in a Jaguar XKE convertible. A pretty, innocent-looking young woman, Monica, is emerging with a big laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store. She glances, momentarily, at the Jaguar and at Barris. 
INT. BARRIS'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER 
Barris enters with a bottle of wine.   Penny is in the same position on the floor. 
PENNY Intrepet's a word, right? 
BARRIS Intrepid. 
PENNY Shit fuck piss. (concentrating) Okay okay okay... 
BARRIS Pen, we should call it a night.     I'm kinda tired. 
PENNY You're tired. 
BARRIS I got a date. 
PENNY Since when? 
BARRIS I just met this girl. 
PENNY Like, just now ? You mean just now? 
BARRIS Yeah.    Kinda. 
PENNY Well, that's rude. 
BARRIS Sorry. 
PENNY Yeah, well, see ya... 
Penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff. 
INT. MONICA'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
It's a young woman's apartment, small and girly.    The doorbell rings. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Monica, clearly not out of her teens, enters the room and answers the door. Barris stands there with the bottle of wine. 
BARRIS Hi! 
MONICA Hi! 
BARRIS Wow, this is a beautiful place you got! 
Barris enters, looks around. There's another teenage girl in pajamas in the kitchenette, mixing tuna salad. 
ROOMMATE Hi. 
BARRIS Hi. 
MONICA Chuck, this is Mindy, one of my roommates. 
BARRIS Hi.

Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see Monica, who doesn't know her. 
MONICA What would you like? 
PEGGY Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines? 
MONICA Yes. Who are you? 
PEGGY Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller. (sotto) How's Bobo? 
Peggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut. 
MONICA Twenty cents, please. 
PEGGY You're kidding? 
Picking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's table and sits opposite him. 
PEGGY I was impressed with what you said in English class today. 
MICHAEL Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature. 
PEGGY You don't? 
MICHAEL (contemptuously) He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk... 
PEGGY Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. 
MICHAEL A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! 
Michael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy studies him for a beat. 
PEGGY The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today. 
MICHAEL What're you doing here anyway? 
PEGGY Coffee and a donut. 
MICHAEL I thought chicks like you traveled in packs. 
PEGGY Hey, man, I'm a hip chick. 
EXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE 
Long shot of the brightly lit donut shop. Michael and Peggy are clearly visible. 
INT. CAR 
Dolores and Terry are driving by. 
DOLORES Terry, slow down. 
TERRY Okay. 
DOLORES Terry! Slow down. 
TERRY What, why? 
EXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE  DOLORES'S POV: 
Peggy and Michael leave the donut shop, get on Michael's motorcycle. 
DOLORES There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons. 
TERRY That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie. 
DOLORES First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT  DRIVING 
Peggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him. Her eyes closed, enjoying the wind blowing in her hair. They head out of town. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
Michael pumps gas. Peggy walks to the washrooms. Looking around she waits a beat, then enters the men's. 
INT. MEN'S WASHROOM 
With all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits. 
EXT. GAS STATION 
Michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building. Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales.

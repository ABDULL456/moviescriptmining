CONTINUED: 
MARTIN 
You take a hockey puck in the face? 
DAN 
A fist. My stepdad socked me. I flew across the room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen. My mom saw everything and still took his side. 
MARTIN 
You got cracked good. 
DAN 
I hate that guy. Two hundred pounds of worthless grease. 
MARTIN 
Why'd he hit you? 
DAN 
I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang and his boat in the same week. His babies. I totaled them. 
MARTIN 
I would have popped you too. 
DAN 
It was worth it. But I didn't deserve the tour in hell. Dan rubs his close-cropped hair. 
DAN 
Don't ever go to military school if you can help it. It sucks. (a beat) I jumped the wall two days ago. 
MARTIN 
You going back? 
DAN 
I'm done with that racket. I'm going to Seattle and playing music. Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good. 
MARTIN 
I know some chords. 
DAN 
Think you can learn drums? 
INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY 
The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives.      Dan plays his guitar. He's really good. 
DAN 
I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus will be opening for me one day. POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates. Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The middle of nowhere.    Martin flips a coin.    Heads. 
DAN 
Shit. Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      Sets the jack under the bumper. A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.      Still a mile away. Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron. The pickup gets closer, a big one.      Heavy with bags of animal feed. Speeding. Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard, into the highway. In front of: 
THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP 
WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll into a ditch. The pickup has lost control, it rolls.      Several times, a heaving mass of steel. CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.         No survivors, that's clear. 
MARTIN 
He can't believe what he has just done.       He takes in the carnage, tugs at his ear. 
EXT. MONTREAL - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE:   PRESENT DAY 
ESTABLISHING the river-bound city.      Beautiful. 
EXT. ST. LAWRENCE RIVER - DAY 
A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.     Gliding toward skyscrapers. 
EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY 
The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship. A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is patrician, elegant. 
EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY 
Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.   Laid back.    The WOMAN approaches them, frantic. 
WOMAN 
I just saw my dead son get off the ferry. The COPS trade looks. 
WOMAN 
Listen to me; he's been dead eighteen years. He just walked right past me. 
INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY 
An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down. He takes his pen, looking at her statement.

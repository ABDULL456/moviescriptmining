MARIUS Good, is it not? 
And indeed... it does taste good. That's the new terror that's gripping him. He crosses himself and stares up into Marius's gentle eyes. Marius bends down, cups Lestat's chin. 
MARIUS Drink and live. You've been brave enough for one night, my son. 
Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds. As Lestat drinks, a barrage of IMAGES flood into him... 
52   IMAGES                                                         52 
of Marius's life through the ages... Impressionistic, subliminal burst of IMAGES, color... the glory days of the Roman Empire to this very moment flash by... 
53   BACK TO LESTAT                                                 53 
He keeps drinking from the vampire Marius who gasps with the creation of his child. 
MARIUS Drink... drink and learn. 
Lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he draws the "life" into him with full force, as... Marius begins to weaken, himself.

MARIUS There... there... that will do. 
But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily. 
MARIUS No... no more.   Lestat, no more! 
With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the rush. 
Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins travelling through his body, consuming him until he screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs... 
MARIUS Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies... 
Wiping his brow as he dies... 
Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power. 
LESTAT More! 
Lestat smiles with red glistening lips.     A beat on Marius as he slowly smiles, too.

A million stars... 
LESTAT (V.O.) I impressed my maker with my thirst for things. He set out to educate me in the unknown. Taught me all about the world, its hidden history... and about myself. 
TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.

MARIUS That's enough, my son... When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die... 
The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength, drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat. Water starts bubbling in. 
MARIUS Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat. A man wears his history on his skin... 
Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him. 
MARIUS I'm talking about humanity. 
As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat... 
LESTAT Humanity? (snort) We're murderers. 
MARIUS We're more than that. Their blood that we take into us carries with it life... their life, their knowledge, their complexity. Appreciate your prey, Lestat. 
Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean. 
55   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           55 
Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance, several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures gathered around.

LESTAT (V.O.) My senses run amok, like a newborn child. And as for my new powers, I was beside myself with the pleasure of it all... 
MARIUS The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on. The spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire. My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny... 
Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers, just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing. 
Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden in shadow.

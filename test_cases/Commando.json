And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE. \nFADE IN \nEXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY 1 \nTIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck. The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it moves along the street. \nINT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON THE BED - DAY 2 \nAs LAWSON awakes with a start. He's late 30's, a little worn. He shakes his WIFE. \nLAWSON What's that? \nWIFE \n(BARELY AWAKE) Unnn...sounds like... \n(STIFLING YAWN) .the garbage men. \nLAWSON On Tuesday? \nWIFE \n(YAWNING) Maybe they changed the schedule... Lawson listens to the noise as it APPROACHES, finally throws his feet into his bedroom slippers. \nLAWSON Shit. \nINT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - PANTRY 3 \nHe runs into the pantry, dragging several ungainly plastic trash bags. \nA85 \nEXT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY 4 \nThe truck SOUND is CLOSER now. We can SEE it at the end of the long driveway. Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered and half-full metal cans, starts running down the driveway. \nLAWSON \n(SHOUTING) Wait a minute, wait a minute! \nEND OF DRIVEWAY - DAY 5 The truck stops at the bottom of the driveway. Lawson stumbles his way towards it, smiles. \nKIRBY Silent and smooth...just like always. He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands. \nMATRIX I better be. You taught me. He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder. Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men. \nKIRBY I need to talk to your dad, Jenny. \nJENNY No way, Jose. Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds billow high above the mountaintops around them. Cont. \nA85 \nREVISED - \"COM.MANDO\" - 4/22/85 9 32 Cont. \nKIRBY Someone's killing your men. \nMATRIX \n(STARTLED) You gave them new identities... \nKIRBY There must have been a leak. Lawson, Forrestal... Bennett have all been hit. \nMATRIX Who's doing it? X \nKIRBY You've made enemies all over the X world, John. It could be the Syrians, the South Africans, the Russians-or a terrorist group. \n(PAUSING) They're gonna find you. Matrix looks toward the cabin. Jenny is watching him through a window. Matrix turns back to Kirby and they begin walking back to the cabin. \nMATRIX We were going to make a normal X life here... \nKIRBY You will...I promise. I'm going X into the city to coordinate with the Federal people. In the meantime, Jackson and Harris will stay with you. Matrix looks the two soldiers over. \nMATRIX They any good? \nKIRBY Real good... \n(PAUSING) But not as good as you were. \nOUT 33- \nCUT TO: \nA65 \nMATRIX - LATER 37 watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny, subdued, comes out of the cabin. \nJENNY Is it bad? \nMATRIX I'm not leaving you... if that's what you mean. \nJENNY Then it can't be bad. She smiles. An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then -- In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris' chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin. .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then crawls through the door after Matrix. The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds SMACKING into the side of the cabin. Then the firing stops. Silence. \nMATRIX \nDIAZ She's safe, Major. Whether she stays that way.is up to you. My people got some business with you... Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house. \nDIAZ .and if you want your kid back, you gotta cooperate. Right? \nMATRIX Wrong. Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest. Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward. \nABRUPT CUT TO: \nEXT. CABIN - DAY 43 \nMatrix JUMPS out of the cabin and RACES to the BLAZER, its hood up. He checks the engine. Torn wires stick up, the distributor cap is disconnected and broken. Cont. \nA85 \n43 Cont. He looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding along the mountain roads. Matrix slams the Blazer's hood...gets inside...puts his weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then, one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he begins to push the car. He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards. Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt... reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his body as well. The Blazer rolls over the edge. \nBLAZER - SEVERAL SHOTS 44 as it bounces wildly down the 45 degree slope. \nINT. BLAZER 45 \nMatrix fights to control the wheel. A low-hanging branch SMASHES the windshield. \nDARK VEHICLE 46 It takes another curve. CAMERA PANS UP, and we SEE the Blazer, coming closer and closer by this direct route. \nTHE BLAZER 47 It barrels down the mountainside, out of control, smashing through trees, bounding off rocks, dropping like a stone. \nINT. BLAZER 48 \nMatrix is taking a terrible beating. But he's almost down to the road...ahead of the black vehicle! \nWIDE ANGLE - WINDING ROAD 49 The two vehicles narrowly miss each other-the dark car almost spins out. \nTHE BLAZER 50 It careens past the other car, slams into a huge boulder -- flips -- ROLLS OVER AND OVER. \nA8 5 \nTHE OTHER VEHICLE 51 o.s. of this mishap, rushing down the road. \nTHE WRECKED BLAZER 52 The wrecked Blazer is BURNING, then suddenly EXPLODES. The CAMERA HOLDS ON this, what looks like Matrix's funeral pyre. Then we SEE movement and SEE a bloodied and injured Matrix crawling away from the intense fire. He stops and looks back at the destroyed Blazer. \nWIDER ANGLE 53 A large group of armed soldiers start to surround Matrix. He stands up, cut, bleeding. The lead man approaches to frisk him. \nMATRIX 54 Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt against the face on the man closing on him. The man's jaw SHATTERS. But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the three men still all over him. Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them. It's Bennett, the man we saw die! \nMATRIX \n(STUNNED) I thought you were -- Bennett reaches up with a bulky pistol and points it at Matrix. \nBENNETT Dead... He FIRES at point-blank range. Matrix is BLASTED backward to the ground. \nCUT TO: \n57 Cont.l Matrix FIGHTS at the chains like a crazy man, but he can't move. Arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck. \nARIUS You kill Velasquez, Major, and you'll get her back. You try anything else... \n(PAUSING) .and I'll send her to you in pieces. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MATRIX'S CABIN - DAY 58 \nGeneral Kirby stands in front of the cabin looking at the bodies of Jackson, Harris and Diaz. Soldiers are searching around and inside the cabin. One of the Soldiers approaches Kirby. \nKIRBY Any sign of Matrix? \nSOLDIER No Sir, just those bodies... \n(PAUSES) .You think there's more? \nKIRBY If he's still alive, I'd expect a lot more. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAX TERMINAL - DAY 59 \nA long, silver limo pulls up to an LAX terminal and parks. \nINT. LIMO - DAY 60 \nCooke is at the wheel. Matrix (in a tropical suit) and Bennett are in the rear seat, SULLY and HENRIQUES on foldout seats facing them. \nBENNETT \n(TO MATRIX) Sully will make sure you get on the plane and Henriques will stay with you to make sure you get off. If I don't get a call from either one of them, she's dead. Cont. \nA85 \n60 Cont. He motions and Henriques opens the car door and brings Matrix out with him. Sully follows them. \nEXT. LIMO - DAY 61 \nMatrix looks back at Bennett through the open door. \nMATRIX I'll be back, Bennett... For you. \nBENNETT I'll be ready. They eye each other, then Sully shuts the door and Matrix watches the limo drive off. Henriques and Sully flank Matrix and they enter the terminal. \nINT. TERMINAL - DAY 62 \nThe three of them pass through the terminal. Matrix looks toward two police officers that are right next to them, but he remains silent. Henriques, Matrix and Sully walk through the X-ray booths as the security guard watches, then they continue on. \nCUT TO: \n(COVERING MOUTH) I'm airsick... He pushes by her. \nINT. DC-10 GALLEY - DAY 67 \nMatrix moves to the service elevator, squeezes in, hits the controls and starts to descend. \nBELOW DECK 67-A the elevator stops in the service area of the big plane. Matrix gets out of the elevator and looks out a port. The place is moving faster! He turns and moves to a door marked CARGO HOLD. It's locked. He PULLS, the door starts to bend, then the lock suddenly SNAPS. He opens the door and crawls inside. \nCUT TO: \nPASSENGER AREA 68 The passengers sit unaware of anything unusual. \nLUGGAGE COMPARTMENT 69 A CLOSE-UP of the latch on the luggage compartment holding Henriques' body shows the latch imperceptively \nCLICK OPEN. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Without looking, he starts to push a box out of the way and -- \nDOG CAGE 75 A doberman Pinscher SNARLS and FLASHES HIS TEETH right INTO the CAMERA. Matrix jerks his hand away from the dog cage just as the Pinscher's teeth push between the bars. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WAR BOAT - DAY \nA uniformed LATINO pilots a speeding war boat in the Pacific. Bennett, standing on the rear deck, watches Arius hang up the microphone on the two-way radio and then Arius disappears below deck. \nA85 \nREVISED - \"COMMANDO\" - 4/24/85 \nBELOW DECK 87 Jenny is huddled in a darkened cabin below. She wipes the tears from her eyes. The door opens, some light comes in and Arius enters the cabin. He moves toward Jenny and looks at her for a long beat. \nARIUS Your father has just left for Val Verde; he should be back with you soon. Does that make you happy? \nJENNY Yes... Arius sits down right next to her. He runs his fingers along her shoulder. \nARIUS Is there anything else that would make you happy? \nJENNY Yes... \n(PAUSING) Watching my Dad kick your balls down your throat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

LAX - DAY 89 \nSully, walking through the terminal, stops as he sees a girl, CINDY, talking on a pay phone. She's a gorgeous stewardess in her late twenties. \nCINDY \n(INTO PHONE) Hi, Lance, it's me! \n(PAUSE) Cindy. Very funny ...yes, that Cindy. They just cancelled my 7:40 X to Vancouver... Cont. \nA85 \nREVISED - \"CO1INANDO\" - 4/29/89 25 \nX 89. Cont Sully takes off his dark glasses, eats her up with his eyes and adjusts his tie. \nCINDY \n(INTO PHONE) I thought since I'm laid over we could... no, laid over, Lance. Samantha? Who's that? Lance? Lance? She slams down the phone and does a slow burn. Then she turns, picks up her flight bag, starts to head off and finds her path suddenly blocked by Sully. \nSULLY Sounds like you need a date. \nCINDY Fuck off, shithead... She pushes by him. Sully watches her go, smiles and then begins to follow her. \nMATRIX You're not gonna make it. She starts the car. Sully drives by them in his Porsche Targa. \nMATRIX Follow him. \nCINDY I knew you were going to say that. She pops the clutch too fast, the tires SQUEAL and Matrix is SLAMMED back against the car floor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AIRPORT GARAGE - DAY 92 \nSully drives out of the airport garage and enters the flow of traffic. After a beat, the Sunbeam LURCHES out of the garage and begins to follow Sully. \nINT. SUNBEAM - DAY 93 \nIn the Sunbeam, Matrix checks his watch. It reads 10:32:00. Cindy concentrates on following Sully's Porsche up ahead. \nCINDY Don't get offended by this question, but... \n(PAUSES) \nAre you going to kill me or something?

SUNBEAM - DAY 94-C \nThe Sunbeam RUNS through the red light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FREEWAY - SULLY - DUSK 95 \nAs dusk approaches, Sully drives along the freeway, occasionally glancing into his rearview mirror. \nKILL HER!! HELP ME!! Cindy looks at Matrix, glances toward Sully, then looks back at Matrix. \nCINDY Okay, okay. X \nX Matrix lets her arm go and she rubs it gingerly. \nCINDY Take it easy, all right. She continues to look at the pleading Matrix, then she turns and hesitantly begins walking toward Sully. Sully walks by a video game parlor, ogles some girls, checks his watch, then heads for the bar on this level. \nA85 \n100 Cont. Cindy walks around the open space, following Sully. She glances back tentatively at Matrix, then she keeps going. Matrix moves in the other direction around the open space, all the while watching Sully and Cindy. \nBAR 101 New Wave music PLAYS as valley gals and sharp dudes dance and mingle about. Sully can dig this scene -- he puts his dark glasses back on. He sits at a table, puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders a drink. A LATIN MAN wearing a leisure suit, looking completely out of place in a joint like this, enters the bar, and stares at a girl with purple hair. He continues into the bar, catches Sully's eye and sits down at the table with him. He reaches under the table and slides the briefcase away from Sully until its next to himself, then hands Sully, still under the table, a bunch of passports. \nOPEN SPACE 102 Cindy approaches the bar, hesitates, then looks back at Matrix. Across the open space, he nods, urging her forward. She hesitantly moves forward. \nBAR Cindy enters the bar, then sees a young security guard, CATES, coming out of the men's room. She moves around a corner so Matrix can't see her and she stops the guard. \nCINDY There's a huge guy across the way who either honestly needs my help or he's an escaped mental fruitcake. Take a look... Cates moves into the doorway, casually glances at Matrix watching the bar, then Cates moves out of Matrix's view. He removes the walkie-talkie from his belt and speaks into it. \nCATES Biggs, you there? \nSECOND LEVEL Another security guard, BIGGS, a muscular black kid, is flirting with some valley girls and ignoring the constant BEEPING of his walkie-talkie. Cont. \nA85 \n104 Cont. \nBIGGS .This ain't no Mexican shit, I'm talkin' Maui wowie. Tired of the BEEPING, he picks up his walkie-talkie. \nBIGGS \n(IRRITATED) What it is, zitface... \nINTERCUT: \nWITH CATES \nCATES There's a guy up here who may be a wacko. I don't think I can handle him alone. \nBIGGS Cool down, puke breath, I'll be right there. (smiling to girls) Wanna see me kick some ass? \nCUT TO: \nMATRIX 106 Matrix is getting anxious. He looks at his watch. \nBAR 107 Sully is in conversation with the Latin man, unaware of what's going on outside. Cindy sneaks a look outside and sees Biggs and his two valley girls approaching Matrix. \nOPEN SPACE 108 Biggs confidently walks along the top level, the girls following. He STOPS abruptly as he sees Matrix, his eyes bulge and he retreats into an alcove and pulls out his walkie-talkie. \nBIGGS Attention all units! Emergency on the theater level! Suspect is six-foot-two, brown hair... \nGun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's hand and picks the gun up. Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He begins walking with him. \nMATRIX Where is she, Sully? \nSULLY Fuck you... Matrix is approaching the Sunbeam as Cindy is getting out. He swings Sully by the heels and BEATS Sully's head against the fender, leaving another dent in the already beat-up car. \nCINDY That's my car, Matrix!! Matrix continues to carry Sully upside down. \nMATRIX I can't hear you, Sully. \nSULLY \nFUCK YOU!! \nMATRIX Loyalty is touching, Sully, but it's not important in your life right now... \nVERY WIDE ANGLE 132 We SEE Matrix walk right up to the edge of a steep drop along Mulholland Drive. He has walked out of Cindy's sight. X \n\u00c2\u0080\u00a2 MATRIX But take gravity... He extends his arms and DANGLES Sully upside-down over the sharp drop. The Los Angeles Basin is spread out below, 180 degrees of twinkling lights. \nMATRIX Gravity is very important in your life right now. Cont. \nA8 5 \nREVISED - \"COMMANDO\" - 4/24/85 39 132 Cont. Sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to his face starts to redden it. Matrix lets go with his right arm. Sully's head drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then adjusts to the new weight. \nSULLY Uhhhh... \nMATRIX I have to warn you, Sully... \n(TAPPING IT) This is my weak arm. \nSULLY \n(DEFIANT) You can't kill me, Matrix. You X need me to find your daughter. \nMATRIX Where is she? He SHAKES Sully, moving him like a fish on a line. \nSULLY I don't know, but Cooke knows. I could take you where I'm supposed to meet him. \nMATRIX But you won't. \nSULLY Why not? Matrix uses his right hand to take something from his pocket and he dangles it in front of Sully. It's Sully's motel key. \nMATRIX Because I already know where. Fear starts to show in Sully's face for the first time as he STARES at the key. He tried to grab at the key, X but Matrix pulls it out of his reach. \nMATRIX Remember when I promised to kill you last, Sully? Cont. \nA85 \nREVISED - \"COMMANDO\" - 4/24/85 39-A 132 Cont.l Hope flickers in Sully's eyes. \nMATRIX I'm sorry I got you involved in this. \nCINDY Then why won't you tell me what it's about. Matrix reaches into his pocket, pulls out his wallet, opens it and hands it to Cindy. \nMATRIX It's about her. Cindy looks at a photo tucked into a wallet, clear plastic photo insert. \nINSERT - PHOTO 136-C X It's a color photo of Jenny. \nTWO SHOT 136-D X \nCINDY Is she the one that was kidnapped? Matrix nods. \nMATRIX Some people are using her to force me to do a job. If I don't get to her soon, they'll kill her. \nCINDY Did you do the job? \nMATRIX No. I knew they'd kill her even if I did it. The only chance she has is if I get to her before they know what I'm doing. Cindy looks at the photo. \nCINDY Is her mother -- Cont. \nA85 \nREVISED - \"COMMANDO\" - 4/24/85 41-A 136-D Cont. \nMATRIX She died when Jenny was born. I was in Laos when it happened, so I came home intending to raise her. \n(PAUSING) But on her third birthday I was in Lebanon. When she went to grade school, I was in Angola. When she had the measles, I was in Pakistan. And now she's been kidnapped because of me. \nCINDY Why were you always travelling? \nMATRIX I was on special assignment. \nCINDY You mean like in the Army or something? \nMATRIX Or something. \nCINDY What did you do? \nMATRIX Things you don't want to know about. Things I sometimes wish I didn't know about. He looks over at Cindy, then looks away. \nMATRIX That part of my life is over with. All that matters to me now is Jenny. \nEXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 137 X \nMatrix drives the car into a parking lot in front of a motel and parks. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT 138 X \nMatrix looks out the window toward the motel. Then Matrix looks down at his watch. \nA85 \nADJOINING ROOM A twenty-year-old couple in bed look up in shock as Matrix and Cooke bounce off their bed and SLAM against the wall. BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor on the other side of the bed. Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke picks it up before Matrix can reach it. Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back the trigger, then smiles. \nCOOKE Fuck you, asshole. He pulls the trigger. CLICK. No more bullets in the bun. The blood drains from Cooke's face. Matrix looks at him. \nMATRIX Fuck you, asshole... He BLASTS Cooke in the jaw and Cooke goes backward through the broken door and falls to the floor. \nORIGINAL ROOM Matrix races back through the broken door, starts toward Cooke, then stops cold. Cooke has fallen on the broken, sharp table leg and the leg goes into his back and comes out of his chest. Cont. \nA85 \n143 Cont. Matrix bends down to the barely alive Cooke. \nMATRIX Where is she, Cooke? Cooke looks blankly back at him. \nMATRIX Cooke... Cooke!! Cooke's eyes go cold and still. He's dead. Cindy approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body, the stake coming out of his chest. Matrix starts emptying Cooke's pockets. There's a wallet containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor. He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes, examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the floor. He pulls out two keys on a key chain. They're car keys. Matrix leaps to his feet. \nMATRIX Come on! \nEXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 144 \nMatrix and Cindy exit from the room and go out to the parking lot.

Coastal is where my instructor gets his fuel. \nCHART Matrix sets the width of the legs of the drafting compass, then puts the point of one of the compass legs onto one of the three dots and draws a circle. \nMATRIX AND CINDY FOOTSTEPS and CONVERSATION approach the door.

They continue to whisper. \nCINDY Type four fuel is amphibian and two hundred fifty gallons is what it would take to fly that plane to the island and back. \nMATRIX But it's not here. I saw everything they've got. Cindy glances at the invoice, then looks up at Matrix. \nCINDY It was refueled at pump station thirty-two, Pacific Pier.

He looks at what's facing him. Bennett, holding Jenny, has the switchblade PRESSED AGAINST her throat. Matrix points his handgun right at Bennett. Bennett pulls Jenny close against his chest and face, shielding himself. \nBENNETT \n(MANIACAL) \nGO AHEAD, MATRIX, SHOOT!! Matrix hesitates, then lowers his gun.

He continues crawling along the wing until he reaches the very end. He pulls his gun from his holster and aims it toward the boat. \nMATRIX'S P.O.V. 371 Matrix tries to aim the gun through the sight, but the bouncing of the seaplane, the bouncing of the boat, and Jenny's nearness to Bennett makes a shot too risky. \nA85 \nMATRIX 372 Matrix lowers his gun. \nINT.

More shells EXPLODE nearby. \nBENNETT \n(SCREAMS) Throw the gun away, Matrix!! Cont. \nA8 5 \n392 Cont. Matrix tosses the gun away down the beach. Bennett violently pushes Jenny into the wet sand along the edge of the water. \nMATRIX 393 Matrix takes his knife out of his wrist sheath and meets Bennett on the sand in front of the boat. \nMATRIX AND BENNETT 394 Matrix and Bennett begin to circle each other. \nBENNETT You're dead... He feints the knife toward Matrix. \nBENNETT .and so is she. \nJENNY 395 Jenny watches the fight in horror. \nMATRIX AND BENNETT 396 Bennett jabs with his knife and SLASHES Matrix, causing a bloody cut. Bennett jabs again. This time Matrix parries the jab, and SLASHES Bennett, causing a bloody cut on him. They circle each other again, FEINTING jabs at each other. BOOM! BOOM!

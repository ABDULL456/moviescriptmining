He stops. He looks at her, betrayed. 
TAMARA (CONT'D) Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that email. 
BEN Explain it then. 
TAMARA Is this about Fran? 
BEN What's Fran got to do with it? 
TAMARA She's the reason you don't trust me. Just because she fucked around on you it doesn't mean that I will. Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with frustration, walks away.

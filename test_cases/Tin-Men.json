A SALESMAN follows on his heels. SALESMAN She's a beauty. BB (looking at Salesman) Who? \nSALESMAN What? BB Who's the beauty? SALESMAN The car. BB I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I lost my concentration. Why do they call cars 'she'? They never say 'he'... always 'she.' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.      BB walks around the Cadillac. BB Very nice... very nice. \nCUT TO: \n2   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LINE OF ROW HOUSES - DAY                     2 We hear YELLING. \n3   INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY                                             3 NORA, a rather plain, but attractive woman in her early 30's, is yelling up the stairs. NORA You're a sick man! Sick! Do ya hear me?! Do ya hear me?! (CONTINUED) \n3   CONTINUED:                                              3 Peeking around the bannister from the second floor is ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30's, handsome in a boyish way. TILLEY Who's sick? NORA Who do ya think I'm screaming at? How many of you are there up there? There's only you, and you're a sick human being. TILLEY (quietly, coming down a few steps) Where's my white on white shirt? The nice one, you know. NORA It's like yelling through a wall to you. I'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is. TILLEY Yes, the one with the permanent stays. CUT TO: \n4   EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY                               4 BB is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the Salesman, going over the contract on the car. BB Now don't try to hustle me here ... you know what I mean. I hate being hustled. Give me an honest price, not one of your 'special' deals... give me an honest price. Do I make myself clear? SALESMAN Now, how much are you willing to pay? BB There ya go... there ya go... you're doing it... you're doing one of those hustle numbers. (CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED                                                      14 BB There's a red light, I'm making a space for myself... that's what I'm doing, in order to get into the street... that's something ya do! TILLEY You came out of nowhere... you bolted out of no place... bolted out of nowhere. BB Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm bolting into the street! You schmuck! You schmuck! He moves toward Tilley. TILLEY Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away from me. BB Back away? You want me to back away? I'll back away. He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car. TILLEY You're a fucking lunatic! He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart. \nBB You're a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me... the man is crazy! People continue to pull them apart. MAN #1 Come on now, calm down, calm down. He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off BB. MAN #2 Take it easy... take it easy...

Backs in front of me, and then  kicks my headlight in... and  I'm crazy. You lunatic! Tilley makes another jump for BB.    Again, people try pulling them apart. BB You're going to prison. Death! Death! They're going to give you death! \nBB looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in side. BB Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and I've been hit. He turns back and looks at Tilley. BB I'm gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch... I'm gonna get even with you. This is no ordinary traffic accident. TILLEY You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to drive. You want to get even with somebody? You picked the wrong person to get even with. Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says they want to get even. I'm gonna get even! CUT TO: \n15   INT. DINER - DAY                                              15 Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast. SAM PICKLES, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly. SAM Did ya see 'Bonanza' last night? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over? (CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                              15 GIL, who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up. GIL Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa? MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at Sam with an investigative look. MOUSE Did he know this guy personally? SAM No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you. MOUSE You're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us? SAM Me?   No, I'm not a bigot. GIL If you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it? \nSAM It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying. MOUSE Come on... you're a bigot, that's what you are. (CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             15 SAM Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house. CUT TO: \n16   EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY                                 16 \nTilley gets out of his car and enters the diner. \n17   INT. DINER - DAY                                             17 He starts walking to the booth where the other tin men are. On his way he yells over to the waitress. TILLEY Florence, eggs and the toast, the way I like it. FLORENCE, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back to Tilley. FLORENCE Not too gooey.     Coffee right away. She trails the last word. Sam is still talking about his problem with \"Bonanza.\" \nCHEESE Up it fifty cents. LOONEY I call... I call. I'm in on this one... I call. MOE We get it, you're calling. CARLY I'm not sure. BB Stay with him. CARLY I don't know. (CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                19 CHEESE Carly, get out of the hand... I'm holding serious cards. Very serious cards. BB He's bluffing. CHEESE If I'm lying, I'm dying. CARLY I'm out. BB Ballsy move. Moe throws his hand in, too. MOE (to BB) Did you get the new Cadillac? BB Yeah.    It's already been hit. MOE What? BB Didn't have it     five minutes, backing out of     the place, and a guy comes out     of nowhere and bangs into my     car. LOONEY So, what ya got? Cheese throws his hand down. CHEESE Pair of sixes. LOONEY Jacks.     Win. CARLY Shit!    Pair of sixes. MOE (about car) How much damage? BB I bet it's six hundred bucks. (CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:   (4)                                             19 LOONEY Six hundred bucks? I'd get rid of the car. That much damage it won't be any good. You may have dented the frame. BB I didn't dent the frame. LOONEY When you hit the frame, the car doesn't ride right. BB He didn't hit the frame! I'll tell you this, I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around. CHEESE You're kidding me? BB Yeah... the guy's totally off the wall. He takes a sip of his coffee. BB I'm gonna get him... just for the fun of it. CUT TO: \n20   EXT. LOWER/MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY                   20 BB's Cadillac moves through the neighborhood, and we see homes that all look to be about 30 to 40 years old. CUT TO: \n21   INT. BB'S CADILLAC - DAY                               21 Moe is with BB in the Cadillac.   BB is driving.   Moe is looking through some papers.

(he looks at his watch) It's about three-twenty now... we've got some time on our hands. You want to get some coffee? BB No, I'm up to here with the coffee. He indicates his throat. \nMOE They got any good pool halls around here? BB I don't know. (beat) You know what would be fun to do..? Let's try the Life Magazine routine. MOE (smiles) Yeah. CUT TO: \n22   EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                22 Slightly run-down.   We're looking THROUGH the LENS of a 35mm camera. BB (O.S.) You know, I think we've got to come over about two feet. The SCREEN SHAKES as BB moves the camera. CUT TO: \n23   INT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                23 A HOUSEWIFE is looking through the curtains, suspiciously. CAMERA MOVES TOWARDS the window and we see Moe and BB moving the 35mm camera around on a tripod. We can faintly hear their talk. (CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                              23 BB I think this  is a better position... the light is  hitting it, which is accentuating  the effect we're going for.   It's very good... very good. MOE (in a creative pose) This shows the flaws in the structure... CUT TO: \n24   EXT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - DAY                                24 BB and Moe at the camera and tripod. BB (under his breath, to Moe) She's at the window. MOE Yeah. BB (in a loud voice) This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine. (even louder) Terrific in Life Magazine! (under his breath) Come on outside, honey. \nStanley is really enjoying the stories Carly and Looney are telling. STANLEY What else? Give me another story ... these stories are great! LOONEY Just a minute... I've got one. You know it's like the faster you can start spiking a job, the guy can't back out of the deal.

He'd say to the guy 'here let me show you how bad a shape your house is in,' and he'd rip off a piece of wood, maybe fifteen feet wide. The guy's house looks like shit so it makes it hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is missing. The Shoe's a fucking wonder. CUT TO: \n54   INT. SAM'S CAR - NIGHT                                        54 Sam is driving and Tilley is rubbing his hands together with excitement. TILLEY Fantastic, Sam! A twenty-seven hundred sale! 'This job is free'! What a beaut! I'm out of the slump! Tilley's riding high again ... Tilley's back! We ought to go and celebrate. Let's go to the Corral and have a drink... we can turn the paperwork in a little later. SAM Gil says that's where 'Marengay' hangs out. \nTILLEY Gil keeps saying it... I've never seen him. (laughing and hit- ting the dashboard) I'm riding high... twenty-seven hundred dollars... 'this job is free'... the man went insane... lost control of himself... his wife and children are out on the street! (he laughs) Sometimes I'm brilliant... I'm fucking brilliant... I can't believe it. CUT TO: \n55   INT. CORRAL CLUB - ANGLE ON MOE AND BB - NIGHT               55 They're looking at the girls, sizing them up. BB (pointing to a girl) See that one, if you were married to that one two weeks you'd have to put your head out of the window for air... this one smothers. (looking over to another girl) That one is the kind that can't live without you... (whiney voice) ... 'Where were you? When will you be home?' MOE I should get out of here. I told my wife I'd be home early tonight. BB Christ!    It's not even one o'clock yet. (beat) How long you been married now? What is it? Twelve... twelve years? MOE Sixteen. BB Holy God! Sixteen years? What do you think? Is it worth it? \nMOE Yeah. BB Why do you think? MOE It's hard to answer. (beat) Seems better than if she wasn't there. BB Quite a recommendation... can't wait to do it. He laughs. (CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:                                              55 ANGLE ON DOOR Tilley and Sam come through the door and walk over to the bar. TILLEY (to Sam) Scotch straight up? SAM Yeah. TILLEY (to barman) Scotch straight up and a rum and Coke for me. He looks around the room at the women. TILLEY Looks like there's good action here tonight. SAM What do you expect, it's half price night for divorced women. The place is hopping. \nANGLE ON BB AND MOE BB Look how much more complicated things are now. There used to be a time you met a girl, you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after. Now, see that one over there... (he points to girl at a table) ... that's Helen Armstrong... maiden name used to be Tudor. Get this, she dated Charlie Rider when I was in high school, seemed like they were together forever. They broke up, she started to go with Lenny Mardigian, they got married, she's Helen Mardigian. That goes on two years... three years, something like that. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              55 BB (CONT'D) They divorce, dates Billy Small for a couple of years, lives with John Isaacs for a year, marries Tommy Selnini... that marriage goes in the toilet, but fast. Now she's dating Charlie Rider who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff who used to be Evelyn Gage before that. (beat; he looks at Moe and laughs) So much for relationships. \nANGLE ON SAM AND TILLEY AT BAR SAM I'm beginning to believe in God. TILLEY You were never one of those atheists, were you? SAM No, I'm not saying that, but I'm beginning to give God more thought. TILLEY So, what did you do? Have some kind of religious experience? SAM I tell ya... I took my wife for lunch yesterday... we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened. TILLEY You found God at the smorgasbord? SAM Yeah. TILLEY Sam, people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains, that kind of thing. SAM Maybe... but I had mine in a smorgasbord. (CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:   (3)                                              55 TILLEY (laughs) Sam, you're too much. SAM I went to get myself a salad and I started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much... that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff. \nA couple of girls hand around glasses of Coca-Cola. Nora stands in the midst of the girls, pleased for Ada. She yells out. NORA I love ya, Ada, and if you're smart you won't come back. The cake is being passed out, and people are talking -- it has become somewhat of a party atmosphere. Nora turns to her friend, NELLIE. NORA I've just decided... I'm going out with him. (CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              57 NELLIE You're kidding? NORA I have to. I just want to know what it's like to be with someone else. She sips her Coke. NORA Because if what I've got with Tilley is as good as it gets, I just... (she shrugs her shoulders) ... I gotta know. NELLIE Well, how are you going to manage it? NORA Tilley doesn't get home until at least two in the morning. NELLIE I hope you know what you're doing ... you speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes, you could jeopardize your whole marriage. NORA Everything I've done in my life has been safe and practical, and where's that gotten me? (she lifts her paper cup) Well, here's to who knows what. They touch their cups. CUT TO: \n58   INT. BB'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM                             58 This is a two-story  apartment in a renovated building. It has high ceilings  and exposed brick. It is sparsely- furnished, but what  there is is decent-looking. We see Nora and BB dancing  closely in the shadows of the dark- ened room. (CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                             58 A Frank Sinatra record is playing on the RECORD PLAYER in the b.g. -- it is \"IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING.\" A bottle of wine is on the coffee table. The remains of Chinese food in containers are alongside. NORA I'm still nervous. BB Well, I guess that's to be expected. You want me to take you home? NORA No, not right now. \nThey dance quietly for a moment. BB Every time I listen to Sinatra, I always remember when I used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40's... you know, a busboy job... Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club, and we used to take our dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna go and hear Sinatra?' Then we'd just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music. I think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown. Nora laughs. NORA I'd go with you and lean against the door. They dance for a bit and look at one another. He leans toward her, holds her tight and kisses her. Then the RECORD STICKS on the words \"that's the time\"... \"that's the time\"... \"that's the time\"... BB slips off one of his loafers, while still embracing Nora, kicks it so that it hits the side of the record table. The RECORD SLIPS a little and continues to play correctly. NORA (she looks at BB) You've got a pretty good aim. BB I sure do. CUT TO: \n59   INT. BB'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         59 Nora is sleeping in the bed, BB slips a robe on, looks at her and then goes down the stairs to the living room.

Would you be interested in our field representative giving you a home demonstration? GIRL #3 ... Home demonstration. We will have some factory representatives in your area today as it happens. A voice calls out. VOICE (O.S.) Tilley!    Let me see you. Tilley walks over to the coffee machine. TILLEY Wing, give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here. Tilley passes Sam on the way to the coffee machine. Sam is looking through the sports page of the newspaper, along with Mouse and Gil. SAM What about 'Super Highway' in the seventh... it's paying 7 to 1. Ran well in its last race. Gil looking at the newspaper. GIL 'Super Highway'... TILLEY Four in the fourth... twenty bucks.

Nice pick, Tilley. Why don't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now. TILLEY 'Rider's Revenge'... I like that name. I've gotta go and see Wing. (a little pissed off) Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday, but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one. Tilley goes through the door into Wing's office. \n75   INT. WING'S OFFICE                                            75 His office    is equally messy and thrown together as everything    else in the Gibraltar offices. As Tilley closes the    door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his cup,    spills over the top and starts to burn his hand. TILLEY Ah!    Ah! He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket. TILLEY What's up, Wing? \nWing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with papers. WING You lost a sale, Tilley. The Hudsons' loan didn't go through. TILLEY What do ya mean? They wouldn't clear the loan?

He's got three outstanding shoplifting charges, failure to pay child support from a previous marriage ... guy's overdue on his mortgage, overdue on his car loan, and he was fired from his last job for misappropriation of funds. TILLEY What's wrong with this world? There are sick people out there! Thievin' son of a bitch like that takes up my time... cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with other people interested in my wares! There's no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country. WING They don't make our job easy, Tilley. TILLEY (lamenting) Wing, it was such a beautiful thing... you shoulda seen how I worked. Like a magician... 'this job is free'! It was my best... my best! There's no fucking justice in this world... there ain't no justice. Tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk. \nWING Did you see the paper? TILLEY What section? WING Take a look at this. He hands the newspaper to Tilley. TILLEY (reading) 'Home Improvement Commission... Hearings begin today...\" Is this McCarthyism? What are they gonna see? If there are any communists?

CONVERTED TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY                        76 An area has been set up for hearings to take place. This seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub- stantial can be worked out. There are boxes and crates all over. There's a long table with a number of commis- sioners behind it, and a defense table a little way across the room. MICROPHONES are being used, and the sound BOOMS -- ECHOING off the walls. A small gallery of people are watching the proceedings. \nANGLE ON JOHN MASTERS who is presiding over the hearings. Even though he wears a tie and a vest, he is nonetheless very sloppily dressed. To his left and right are two other home improvement commissioners.

TILLEY (putting his hand to his forehead) Six... six... six... six. (beat) I'm thinking one. Whose one? \nSAM Mr. Motor. TILLEY Then that's it, I'm going with one. SAM Tilley, this is insane. You're picking horses because you think you're clairvoyant or something. TILLEY Sam, I'm  not doing too well by checking  the stats, so why not. I put my  hand to my forehead, I see a one  -- Mr. Motor in the second...  twenty bucks. They both look toward the track, the horses race to the finish line. Number nine streaks across the finish line. \nSAM Hallihan's Daughter. TILLEY (laughing) I got it... I got it... He picks up the racing form. TILLEY Three to one... hundred and sixty smackers. (laughs) Hand to the forehead! Hand to the forehead! (CONTINUED) \n79   CONTINUED:   (3)                                             79 SAM You're not exactly talking about a long shot. Mr. Motor, for instance, is coming off at 50 to 1. Tilley taps his forehead, with his eyes closed. TILLEY Third race, I see a six... I see a three. I don't think the verdict's in on that one yet. Tilley stands up and is going through his money and race tickets. \nTILLEY Wing paid a hundred on number five, he loses, I got hundred and forty... next race I'll lay down the bet. (beat) What you taking in this   race? SAM Thrifty's Delight -- number four -- 20 bucks. TILLEY You take Thrifty's Delight -- 20 bucks, I got 20 on Mr. Motor, Wing's got a hundred on Night Fire. What's the odds on Night Fire? SAM Twenty to one. TILLEY I don't see Night Fire winning. Fuck it, I'm not gonna even place the bet... I just made a hundred bucks. SAM What are you, crazy?   What happens if he wins? TILLEY He's not gonna win... I feel it. (CONTINUED) \n79   CONTINUED:   (4)                                                79 Tilley heads towards the betting booths.

BB Yeah, yeah... who else is it gonna be... 'who, Nora\"!... who else is there? (beat) The whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me. It's one thing when they're with you for a night, but when they live with ya, it's stretching the point. They got a lot of things they bring with them... you go to the bathroom you see 'things' you never saw before. MOE So, what's the todo?

MOE You mean all this time you've never lived with a girl? BB What?! Did we just meet? How long we been partners? No, I've never lived with a girl! MOE Boy, oh boy! Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? BB Yes, I did. I came in  last night, she was sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I  never got out of bed on the left side... in my life, never from the left. (beat; he looks out of the car window) I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this  girl, Dorian. For a week we  were together, but it wasn't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff. She didn't  have things in my room. \nBB gives a big sigh.

TILLEY Eight hundred? WING Yeah... I wanna bet eight hundred on Fordnee Lane. TILLEY (feeling uncom- fortable) Fordnee lane -- eight hundred. Sam is looking at Tilley knowing that he's really in a jam. TILLEY Eight hundred. WING (calling to Waiter) Waiter, can you get me a cup of coffee? Tilley looks over to Sam, with panic on his face.    Wing turns back to Tilley and Sam. WING You guys want anything else? TILLEY (nods \"no\") Er... hum... er... hey, Wing... I tell you, I got a problem. WING What is it?

TILLEY Wing, it was the craziest thing... I didn't want to mention it earlier because it was so nuts... it was the craziest thing. WING What? TILLEY I don't know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself. It was an accident... it's like one of those things out of the blue... it's crazy... you can't explain it... it happens. WING (to Sam) Sam, what is he talking about? SAM (quietly) He had an accident of some sort. TILLEY It happens... I don't know how... I don't know how to explain. It's too crazy, I swear to God, Wing. WING Wait a minute... you're telling me that I didn't win the last race? TILLEY You won, Wing... you won, it's just that you're not getting any money... it was a fluke. I swear, I don't know how it could have happened. A ten-year-old couldn't have made the mistake I made... I don't know, I swear.

TILLEY If there was some way I could make it up, believe me, I would, because you know where I stand. There's a beat while Wing just looks at Tilley. TILLEY You know where I stand, Wing. If there was any way, believe me, I'd make it up. I'd give you thirty percent of what you didn't get because it was a fluke... I'm willing to make some kind of retribution. WING You just pocketed the God damned money... you just took my money and slipped it into your God damned pocket, didn't you? TILLEY No. I'd split fifty-fifty with you, that's how badly I feel under the circumstances. WING You get this straight, you son of a bitch, you owe me sixteen plus... I want sixteen plus. \nMASTERS Fossey says it should go down very well with the city council. Could help us appropriate more funds.

DELANEY The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record. They say, and I quote here, 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding.' (looking up from paper) Is that true? TILLEY It sounds right. DELANEY Are you aware that, according to the Home Improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives? TILLEY (shrugs his shoulders) We wanted to be a little more generous, that's all. DELANEY The couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs, as you had promised. SAM (leaning into microphone) We didn't get any leads from them. Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be. It didn't generate the activity that we had hoped.

MASTERS (leaning into microphone) Excuse us for one moment. He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer. Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on. Masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners. They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the microphone. MASTERS Thank you very much, gentlemen. Should there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to reserve that right. TILLEY (leans into microphone) Glad we could be of some service.

She pulls away from BB and continues walking.      BB walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain. BB I gotta talk to you. NORA I don't want to listen. BB Give me a chance to explain.    You owe me that much. Nora still walking toward her car in the downpour. NORA I don't owe you anything. BB lets her walk away.   After a beat, he yells out. BB It was a lousy thing to do, okay? It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband... but the fact is that I never would have met you otherwise. Nora stops and turns to look at BB. \nBB (more quietly) It was lousy... it was a disgusting, terrible thing... but a lot of good came out of it. NORA What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing? BB I'm not always a nice guy, I admit that. I got a lot of training in deceit... it's an occupational hazard.

BB I didn't want to have to come here. I wish that I didn't have to ever see you again. I've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me. I was going through life, sailing along, pretty good... doing okay, and I tried to get even with some crazy guy... and I'm here. NORA The wet becomes you. Gets rid of some of the slickness. BB I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of this, but if this stuff's got to happen, I guess I've got no choice. I wanna... ya know... (he gets angry) ... I wanna be with ya! Okay, I said that... I said it, okay?! I wanna be with ya! It pisses the hell out of me, and I'm gonna tell you that to your face, but I want to be with you because... I miss you and I'd like to live with you... I'd like to marry you... and that's that! Nora eyes him carefully. The rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on BB's head. After a long moment.

They got to send out guys like you to spy? \nSTANLEY Well, we just started out, and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot of credibility in the community. BB walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second, grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. Stanley crashes into the filing cabinet. BB You know what your big problem is, Stanley? You're lazy. If you want to find out stuff, then you dig... you get on the phone... you canvas... 'We're from the Home Improvement Commission...' Go find your leads... that's what we do all the time. You're just lazy, Stanley. If we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence. Instead, you snoop around... steal files. What is this? Undercover time? You think you're breaking up some big drug ring? Is this the Mafia you've infiltrated? All you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake! (beat) You want some files?

TILLEY Yes, sir!    Yes, sir! Tilley    keeps moving around the table, sinking one ball after    the other. He's enthusiastic, excited and confi- dent.     He sinks another ball, and another. He sinks every    ball, then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de grace. \nBB (trying to shake Tilley) You make this one here, and you win. TILLEY Don't I know it... don't I know it! He shoots. The eight ball heads for the pocket and doesn't make it. It hangs up on the felt about two feet from the pocket. BB Bad break. BB quickly goes to work... sinks every one of his balls. He eyes the eight ball carefully. Tilley's nervous. A couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the ball goes or doesn't. BB lines up the shot; he shoots, and it misses, hanging up on the lip of the pocket. TILLEY Tough break. Tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball. TILLEY You lose.

BB gets to his feet... the two guys eye one another, moving. BB quickly moves with incredible cat-like speed with four hits into the stomach, really fast, and one hit to Tilley's head. Tilley falls into the rack of pool cues, they all fall to the ground. BB goes to jump on Tilley.

Tilley pushes BB's head onto the ground, trying to hit it against the floor. BB gets a hand free and hits Tilley hard in the side of the head. The tin men have seen enough and jump in and pull Tilley and BB apart. AD LIBS: \"That's enough, you guys\" ... \"Come on, break it up.\" BB and Tilley stand up.

Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'? \nON TILLEY who is falling apart. TILLEY As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers. MASTERS It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle. (beat) The point that we'd like to stress, is that you misled these people. Told them the job was free. Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars. That is misleading and deceptive sales practice. TILLEY It was    temporary insanity. I don't    know... it just came over me ... it    might have been something I ate.     I don't know... it was crazy,    I'm the first to admit it was a    crazy thing to do. Believe me...

You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place. TILLEY What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations. \nON BB who is watching the proceedings intently. MASTERS (O.S.) It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state. \nCAMERA ON MASTERS MASTERS It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding... \nCAMERA ON TILLEY He's not very happy.

Always said that about you... he has. WING I'll give you hundred and fifty. TILLEY Wing, I need a bit more than that... I got expenses. WING What's wrong with your wife?   She doesn't work?

SAM (to Mouse) Did she hear me say scotch straight up? WING My sources tell me this Home Improvement Commission is for real... it's no jackpot. These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass, so any of the scams that you guys are pulling, they get wind of it, they take your license and it's goodbye to this business. MOUSE They take away your license? They take away your livelihood? What kind of people are these? SAM They have no respect for the working man. TILLEY Which scams are they talking about? They got a list? \nWING Any irregularities, you know, selling a house on the pretense that it's a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback... the Life Magazine hustle... you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can run.

The crowd eagerly   follows right on the heels of BB and Tilley. BB and Tilley   both take off their sports jackets. BB (seeing the people gathering around) What is this? What is this crowd here? We're charging admission? TILLEY Back away... give me some elbow room. \nBB and Tilley both take up  fighting stances and circle one another looking to take  a shot. A police car pulls into the lot. The sound of   the tires on the gravel catches Moe's attention and  he sees it's the police. MOE (quietly to BB and Tilley) Police! Tilley and BB immediately drop their guards and lean against a car. One cop gets out of the police car and heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the car. No one knows quite what to do since the policeman is so nearby.

Tilley does his now   familiar neck exercises to relieve tension. He's hard    to read... a mixture of happiness and sadness. CUT TO: \n70   EXT. DINER - NIGHT                                           70 THROUGH the window of the diner we see Tilley sitting alone at a table drinking a cup of coffee. The Sinatra record \"IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING\" plays over this. CUT TO: \n71   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          71 Nora is getting out of her car in front of her house. She starts to walk toward the house and stops as she sees her clothing, shoes, etc. scattered all over the lawn. She tries to take in the scene -- coats are lying on hedges, underwear on the flower beds... she's shocked.

She just stands there and tears run down her face. \nLONG WIDE SHOT of Nora's BACK TO the CAMERA, with all her possessions strewn over the front garden of her house. CUT TO: \n72   EXT.

I don't know what happened to him... he must have found out I was with you... I don't know... I don't know what to do. She starts to cry.   She goes to hug BB. NORA Can I stay with you for a day or two? BB puts his arms around Nora. BB Sure. CUT TO: \n", "test3_id": 1070}

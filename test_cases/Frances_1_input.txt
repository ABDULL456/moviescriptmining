ON SCREEN the corners of Frances' mouth begin to tremble, but her eyes remain wide and innocent. The Fire Chief slowly inclines his head toward hers. The brim of his hat hits her forehead. Frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing. The Fire Chief looks stunned. She tries to control herself. 
FRANCES I'm sorry... (looking into camera) I'm sorry, let's go back. 
Laughter inside the screening room. A small light flicks on, and from behind we dimly SEE TWO MEN. 
MAN #1 (irate) What the hell is that? What's she doing? 
LAUGHING MAN That's talent, Andy. 
MAN #1 (after a beat) Oh. 
EXT. CATWALK - DAY 
Frances smiles and eases shut the screening room door. We HEAR the Laughing Man inside shout: "Let's see that again!" Frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match. 
A man's hand appears, holding a lighter. She looks up: It's Harry, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat. 
FRANCES Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real person! 
Frances throws her arms around him. They hug warmly. 
HARRY How ya doin', Farmer? 
FRANCES Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood? 
HARRY Came to get a tan. 
They compare forearms. 
FRANCES Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason? 
HARRY (staring out) Kaminski. 
FRANCES Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide. 
HARRY Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. 
FRANCES What? 
HARRY They killed him. They threw him out that window. 
FRANCES Oh no... 
HARRY Eight stories. 
She stares down two stories to the ground, imagining: 
FRANCES Jesus. 
HARRY (also staring down) Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die. 
FRANCES (walking on) But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it? 
HARRY (shrugs) He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. (brightening) Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. (confidentially) I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. (turns around, displaying his shirt) How d'ya like the camouflage? 
FRANCES You jackass! (pushing him down the stairs) C'mon, let's get out of here. 
EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY 
Harry and Frances walking arm in arm. 
FRANCES Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now. 
HARRY I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability. 
FRANCES (smiling) I know what ability you're interested in. 
HARRY Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. (off her sober expression) For old time's sake. 
FRANCES (serious) Harry... I met someone. 
HARRY (stiffens slightly) Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? 
Frances shakes her head. 
HARRY Actor? 
She nods. 
HARRY Good. Then it's temporary. (whispers) All actors are phonies. 
He's joking, but she doesn't respond. 
HARRY Serious, huh? 
FRANCES Yeah. 
HARRY Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. 
She smiles wistfully, seeing him cover up his disappointment. She squeezes his arm and they continue walking. 
INT. SOUND STAGE - SET (RHYTHM ON THE RANGE) - DAY 
Lights being adjusted, cameras set, actors walking through their blocking. In the midst of this we SEE Frances, dressed in western attire, making a point to the WARDROBE MISTRESS, who is listening without enthusiasm.

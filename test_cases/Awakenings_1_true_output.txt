14A.   EXT. TENEMENT (LUCY'S) - ESTABLISH - DAY 
15.    INT. TENEMENT - NEW YORK.- DAY                                  1 The needle of a Victrola clawing at the endless music-less inner bands of a 78 . . .                                .*       . Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette table. A puddle of coffee on the floor. Ceramic shards, a broken cup. . An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs of a discarded marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a shuttered living room. Furniture from another era and the clutter of a lifetime. A shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola. Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and preposterously still. The back of her head is flat and bald, the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades. On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses. Insane or retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just barely audibly, a melody. SAYER'S VOICE Can you hear me?                 . 
16.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY Distant music of children's laughter. Perhaps real, emanating from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote region of the woman's damaged mind. Arrested of all movement, she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan. SAYER'S VOICE Do you know where you are? (nothing back) Do you remember being brought here? (nothing back) Do you know what has happened? If she does, she gives no indication. No word or gesture. No change of expression on her mask of a face. She is elsewhere (or nowhere), cut adrift by her illness, living in a private world (or hell). SAYER'S VOICE Can you hear me? Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes. Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable.                                         .   ·· 
REV. 12/5/89 (BLUE)       Pg.-lO 16.CONT.                                                            16. Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from it. He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are loose, bent out of shape*-- and gently slides the temples back over her ears. He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood. The form in the machine, at the top, reads -- BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in a lower section headed -- FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS. He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand clutching the glasses. She is not moving, but she has moved. That, or she is dead. Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face. He studies her for a moment, and for that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her. He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the floor. He waits. She doesn't retrieve them. He picks them up and holds them out to her. She doesn't move to take them. He lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the instant before they hit the floor. Sayer just stares. SAYER«S VOICE Her name is Lucy Fishman . . . r 
16B.    INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON   16B. Dr. Kaufman, the hospital's Chief of Medicine, notices a number of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on his way into Sayer's examination room - SAYER'S VOICE She was found by neighbors with                               * her sister, several days after the , sister had died . . . 
17.    INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                       17. The same room as before. The same woman. All that has changed is the light. It's late afternoon. SAYER (CONT'D) According to the neighbors,                                    * she's never set foot outside her                               * apartment, has no other living                                 * relatives, and has always been the                             * way she is now - without any                                   * comprehension or response.                                     * 
Kaufman tries to feign interest. He glances to the others         1 Sayer has summoned to the room -- two other doctors, Tyler and Sullivan, and Miss Costello. SAYER And yet . . . Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her. Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it. And stays there, stiff, still. Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks. Dismissing the phenomenon --· DR. KAUFMAN A reflex. SAYER If she batted it away I might call that a reflex. She doesn't bat it away, she catches it. DR. KAUFMAN -        It's still a reflex. SAYER I'm sorry, if you were right I'd agree with you. Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment. Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any. SAYER It's as if . . . having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball. Awkward silence.    Eventually-- DR. TYLER The "will of the ball?" Sayer nods. Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd. DR. SULLIVAN Excuse me. Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room.   So does Tyler. Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.

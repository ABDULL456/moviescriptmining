PAUL No one. It... seemed the proper way. 
KYNES That it is. (inner voice) He shall know your ways as if born to them. 
Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely now. 
GURNEY We're wasting time, Sire. 
Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the ornithopter...

Jessica trembles. 
JESSICA (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!

...and the thopter turns slowly as it goes up into the light. 
93D. (Deleted) 93E. EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
From outside the Palace's atomic shield we see the blur of the ornithopter pass through a porthole and come out perfect like a gleaming jewel.

KYNES Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting. 
95.  EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
They crest the top of the wall which opens out into a black, level expanse of rock, cratered and fractured. On the other side is the huge, seemingly endless plain of sand, the Great Desert. In the hazy distance, flashes of light can be seen.

PAUL Will we see a worm? 
KYNES Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. 
PAUL Always? 
KYNES Always. 
PAUL Why do they come? 
KYNES To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. PAUL (inner voice) I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. (out loud, suddenly) Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice? 
Kynes turns instantly and stares at Paul. Gurney sees the wonder in Kynes' eyes. 
GURNEY The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe. 
Kynes takes a second look at young Paul. 
KYNES As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows.

98.  INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
GURNEY Dust cloud ahead, Sire. 
KYNES That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice. 
DUKE LETO Wormsign? Is it wormsign? KYNES Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp eyes Sire.... May I? 
Kynes grabs the microphone and dials in the correct frequency.

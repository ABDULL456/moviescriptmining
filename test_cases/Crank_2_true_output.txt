ith the crowd cheering and traffic stopped, CHEV gets a shot of adrenaline and goes for broke. EVE shrieks like a banshee as he enters her. 
CHEV (CONT'D) I'M STILL ALIVE! I'M STILL ALIVE!!! 
CHEV'S HEARTBEAT is slamming, he's really giving it to her, making full eye contact with the busload of tourists the entire time. 
CHEV doubles his efforts, desperately fighting for the climax, when ... 
BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. 
HEV (CONT'D) What was that? 
EVE Oh God... Oh God... yes... 
BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM.   CHEV'S CELLPHONE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
CHEV Shit! 
CHEV reaches for the E phone. 
VE What are you doing?!! 
CHEV puts the phone up to his ear. 
CHEV Yeah. 
SPLIT SCREEN WITH: 
INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME CU of KAYLO'S face. 
KAYLO I've got Verona. 
We see that KAYLO is duct taped to an office chair in what appears to be an old warehouse, knife to his neck, held by unseen captors. He's been badly beaten up. 
6A                                                                  86A EXT STREET, CHINATOWN, SAME TIME 
CHEV is still going through the motions with EVE, but his attention has shifted 100% to the voice on the phone. 
CHEV Kaylo? 
KAYLO (V.O.) I've got Verona, man. 
CHEV yanks it out and pulls up his pants. 
EVE What??? 
CHEV No shit.    Where are you? 
INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME 87A                                                                  87A KAYLO sweats, looks off camera.    A hand presses the knife closer to his throat. 
KAYLO Don Kim's shirt factory.     Upstairs. 
EXT STREET, CHINATOWN, SAME TIME 86B                                                                 86B CHEV finishes zipping up. 
EVE (furious, in disbelief) What's the matter with you?!! 
CHEV (to EVE) Shh. (to KAYLO) Downtown? 
INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, SAME TIME 87B                                                                 87B KAYLO (gulping) Yeah. 
86C                                                                 86C EXT STREET, CHINATOWN, SAME TIME 
CHEV'S demeanor changes to an icy slow burn. He holds EVE back with one arm as she tries to get at him, flipping out. 
CHEV Listen to me. You don't let that motherfucker out of your sight. I'll be there in ten minutes. You got that? 
KAYLO (close to breaking into tears) OK, Chevy ... 
CHEV Out. 
END SPLIT SCREEN. 
CUT TO: 
INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, MOMENTS LATER KAYLO looks up at his captors, miserably, as the phone clicks off. The CAMERA instantly flashes down to a low wide angle, looking straight up as a bag is thrown over KAYLO'S head and two unidentifiable men close in on him, lifting the chair off the ground ... then takes its time moving slowly down to reveal KAYLO'S feet, bicycling wildly, then twitching, finally just dangling ... both in fishnet and high heeled pumps. One pump falls to the concrete as KAYLO goes still

CHEV I have to go. Please understand.

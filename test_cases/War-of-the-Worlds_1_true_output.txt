(with hesitation) Is it over? 
Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to get an idea of what just happened. 
RACHEL 
Where are you going? 
RAY 
Just checking things out. Just wait, wait there. 
RACHEL 
Are we going to be okay? 
RAY 
I don't know. 
RACHEL 
You don't know. 
RAY 
No. I meant... Rachel, please, just stop asking so many questions. Just wait here. 
Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power. He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which has also stopped working. 
EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD AREA - EVENING 
Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots. 
EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - FRONT STREET - EVENING 
Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working. By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk where he is joined by his friend. 
FRIEND 2 
You believe this Ray? Every single car. 
Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him. 
RAY 
(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. 
ROBBIE 
The car just stopped and... 
RAY 
(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you okay? 
ROBBIE 
... and the lighting started hitting about a block away over and over again. And me and this other guy we... 
RAY 
(getting angry) Where the hell'd you go? 
ROBBIE 
Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ... by the church. 
RAY 
Did you see it? Did you... Were you near it? 
ROBBIE 
Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and over the lighting started hitting. It opened up this hole or something... 
RAY 
26 times? 
ROBBIE 
Yeah. 
RAY 
Okay, well, you're okay? 
ROBBIE

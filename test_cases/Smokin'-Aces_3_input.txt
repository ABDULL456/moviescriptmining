MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D) (beat) Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big helper boy now, go on an' get those things and grandma'll rub your feet! 
WARREN My karate feet? My crazy Karate kick feet!! 
Warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great, disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this. 
MARGIE You little angel-butt! Grandma'll rub those feet forever! 
Elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin-- sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall. 
MARGIE (CONT'D) Oh you silly-sil! Never mind, Grandma'll get it! 
Margie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub. 
WARREN (barking out) Bow to your opponent! 
Warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically delivering a "Kata" of punches and kicks...violently and expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore, helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with perspiration, works himself into a furious lather. 
ELMORE (trying to speak) Pl-- kid, st-- stop... 
Elmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection beginning to poke through   his karate   gee... 
Margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep. 
Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head, gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed.

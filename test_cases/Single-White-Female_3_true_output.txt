She bends down and takes the gun out of the paper bag. 
HEDRA Why are you making me do this ? 
She snaps a cartridge into the chamber of the gun. 
HEDRA We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble without me. But I'm not going to leave you. 
She walks to Allison and kneels on the floor besides her, pointing the gun to her head 
HEDRA That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go. Up ! Up ! Up ! 
She slaps her face. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra leads Allison along the hall. She is carrying her paper bag in one hand and the gun in the other hand. She still has her gloves on. Allison is carrying a small plastic case. 
HEDRA Go ! Go-go-go ! 
They reach the elevator and Allison is ready to press the call button, but Hedra moves her away towards the staircase. 
HEDRA No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already involved. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - MAIN STAIRCASE - INTERIOR DAY They climb the stairs. Hedra is pushing Allison with her gun. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
They reach Graham's front door. Allison rings the bell, waits a couple of seconds and turns around. 
ALLISON Nobody's home. 
Hedra takes some keys out of her bag and gives them to Allison with the gloved hand that is still holding the gun. 
HEDRA Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go ! 
Allison takes the keys and unlocks the door. 
ALLISON He must be sleeping. We were up late last night. 
Hedra seems very nervous. While Allison is unlocking the door, she keeps looking around her and pressing Allison's back with her gun. 
Allison opens the door, and enters the apartment, followed by Hedra. 
ALLISON Graham ? 
HEDRA He can't hear you. 
Hedra closes the door behind them. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY Low angle shot of the building, taken from street level. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY 
HEDRA (voice over) Wait till you see me. 
Hedra comes out of the bathroom, with a dark towel on her head. 
The cat crosses the corridor and enters the bathroom. 
Hedra puts her towel down : her hair, instead of being red like Allison's, is now dark brown. 
HEDRA Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking like you any more, can I ? 
She smiles. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY Hedra enters the living-room. 
HEDRA Okay now, Allie, don't laugh. 
She walks in front of the window, and makes a couple of dance steps. 
HEDRA Ta-dah ! 
Reverse angle shot on Allison, tied up in an armchair with duct tape. Each one of Allison's arms is tied on each armrest of the armchair. Her legs are tied on the legs of the armchair, and her chest is tied on the back of the armchair. There is also a piece of tape across her face to keep her mouth shut. 
Hedra laughs and turns the TV set on. The screen shows a documentary about African fauna. Hedra turns the volume slightly up. 
HEDRA How's that ? Good ? 
She puts the remote control on the armrest of the armchair, within easy reach of Allison's right hand. Allison doesn't move at all. 
HEDRA 22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All right. 
She walks away from the armchair, takes the towel off her neck and down on the back of a chair. She takes her purse. 
HEDRA So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too. Okay ? Be good. Bye. 
She gets out of the room. 
Allison moves for the first time : she turns her head around, then looks back at the TV screen. 
Reverse angle shot. On the TV screen, close up of a lion yawning.

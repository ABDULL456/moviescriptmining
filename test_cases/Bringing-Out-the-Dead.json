{"test1_input": "\"Bringing Out The Dead\", early draft, by Paul Schrader \nBRINGING OUT THE DEAD \nFirst draft (11/7/97) \nPaul Schrader \nFrom the novel by Joseph Connelly \nAfter World War One it was called Shell Shock. \nAfter World War Two it was called Battle Fatigue. \nAfter Vietnam it was called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \nFrank Pierce, 28, drives an EMS vehicle for Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, New York City. He has been a paramedic for five years. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS--NIGHT \nAn EMS \"bus\" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian canyons of New York. \nFRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, \"EMS\" gold logo on one collar, \"OLM\" on the other. \"Our Lady of Mercy Paramedic\" is inscribed in white across the back of his navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves, beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight, collapsible baton. \nLARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash. \nFrank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes, beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons. \nDispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: \"Ladder 4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32. 13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire. Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out, says she's going into cardiac arrest ...\" \nFrank's detached voice speaks over the urban landscape: \nFRANK (V.O.) Thursday started out with a bang: a gunshot to the chest on a drug deal gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight-- all the elements in place for a long weekend. I was good at my job: there were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me and my mind worked with a cool authority I had never known. But in the last year I had started to lose that control. Things had turned bad. I hadn't saved anyone for months. I just needed a few slow nights, a week without tragedy followed by a couple of days off. \nThe radio continues: \"Zebra, 13Z, 524 East 17--\" \nLARRY (on radio) We're there. \nThe ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage walk-ups. Frank and Larry jump out: Frank lugs the EKG monitor and airway bag, Larry the drug box, yellow oxygen pack slung over his shoulder. Neighbors crowd around. \nOLD WOMAN Which apartment? Which apartment? \nFRANK Move back. Where's the stairs? 5A. \nOLD WOMAN Oh Jesus, it's Mr. Burke. \nThe front door opens, a young boy holding it. \nAuthor's note: in emergency situations, either on the street or in the hospital, it is assumed there is continual background noise--voices, sirens, cries, questions, etc. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TENEMENT STAIRWELL--NIGHT \nFour flights up: Frank and Larry climbing rotting steps, gray-yellow painted walls, red doors with three locks each, Larry, out of breath, his stomach rolling around like a bowling ball in a bag. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BURKE APARTMENT--NIGHT \nThey enter 5A. MRS. BURKE, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. Someone leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr. Burke, 60, lies unmoving, stretched on the bed. A young woman, MARY BURKE, 24, kneels over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth. \nJOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm: \n", "test1_true": "Frank and Larry moving the body to the floor: \nFRANK How long ago did he stop breathing? \nJOHN Maybe ten minutes. Woman on the phone tried to tell us how to do CPR. Please, you gotta do something. \nFRANK We'll do all we can. \nLarry ripping open Mr. Burke's shirt, prepping electrode patches, hooking wires, Frank opening Burke's mouth, feeling a puff of gas escape; Larry calling for backup. Burke's EKG rhythm on the monitor a flat green line. \nFrank's training takes over: he injects the long steel laryngoscope down Burke's throat, he finds a vein, injects epinephrine, followed by atrophine, followed by another epi: no response on the monitor. Larry pulls out the paddles: \nFRANK (CONT'D) Clear! Clear! \nLarry activates defibrillator, shock--Burke's body heaves. Sweat drips from Larry's nose onto Burke's chest. \nMARY No more, please don't! \nThey shock him again. This time the body moves less. Frank glances up: Mr. and Mrs. Burke's wedding photo sits on the nightstand. Other pictures: a day at the beach, a young serviceman, happy parents. Frank's mind drifts: \nFRANK (V.O.) In the last year I had come to believe in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back, spirits angry at the awkward places death had left them.  I understood how crazy it was to think this way, but I was convinced if I turned around, I'd see Old Man Burke standing at the window, watching, waiting for us to finish. \nFrank feels Burke's heart beneath cracked ribs. The EEG remains flat. He's dead. It's time to quit. \nFRANK (CONT'D) (to Larry) I'll take over. Call ER and ask for an eighty-three. (to Mrs. Burke) Sorry. \nLarry stands, breathing heavy, looks for a phone. Frank turns to notice relatives and neighbors standing around. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Do you have any music? \nMARY What? \nFRANK Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked. \nMARY John, play the Sinatra. \nJohn enters crying. Mary repeats softly: \nMARY Play the Sinatra. \nJohn exits. Frank notices Mary for the first time: blond hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black makeup running down her cheeks. He notices her prom picture, glances back to Mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that day eight years before. Something special about her, that something that hits you right away. \n\"September of My Years\" plays from the other room. Frank continues massaging Mr. Burke's chest (now to Sinatra beat), even though it's hopeless. Larry returns: \nLARRY It's OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty- three. \nFrank feels something strange, looks into Burke's pupils, checks his neck pulse, wrist pulse. His eyes go to Larry: \nFRANK No we can't. He's got a pulse. \nLARRY No shit. \nLarry checks the monitor: the green line up and down. Mary senses a change in status: \nMARY Is he going to be alright? \nFRANK (not encouraging) His heart's beating. \nA distant siren signals the arrival of backup. Frank turns to Larry: \nFRANK (CONT'D) Have 'em bring up a stretcher. \nHe looks from Mary back to Mr. Burke--breathing but comatose. \n", "test1_id": 2772, "test2_input": "MARY I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say. \nFRANK Even when you say the things, there's always more things. \nMARY Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father. \nFRANK Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now. \nMARY That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home. \nLarry walks back with a coffee for himself and a brown bag beer for Frank. \nLARRY Time to switch. I wheel, you heal. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE--NIGHT \n4:00am.  The EMS vehicle drives downtown. The city has transformed: a deserted city, inhabited by the hardcore: hardcore night-shift employees, hardcore party-goers, hardcore druggies, hardcore homeless, people with something special to do or nowhere to go. \nRADIO DISPATCHER 12 David on the corner of Thirty- eight and Two you'll find a three- car accident, two taxis and a taxi. One-two Henry, 427 East Two-two, report of a very bad smell. No further information ... \nLarry driving at a good clip, riding both the gas and the break pedals, enjoying the newfound freedom of movement. \nFRANK Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls. \nLARRY Relax, will you. \nFrank places both hands on the dash as Larry squeals around a corner. \nFRANK (V.O.) The biggest problem with not driving is that whenever there's a patient in back you're also in the back. The doors close, you're trapped. Four in the morning is always the worst time for me, just before dawn, just when you've been lulled into thinking it might be safe to close your eyes for one minute. That's when I first found Rose ... \nLarry slows down on a side street. Frank turns to watch a homeless man. The man looks back: it's Rose. The Rose face. \nFRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was on the sidewalk, not breathing. \nFrank turns to Larry: \nFRANK (CONT'D) I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night. \nLARRY You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that. \nFRANK Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight. \nLARRY You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here. \nFRANK Yeah, you're right. \nLarry pulls into the Jacob Riis projects by the river, slows to a stop.  Larry cuts the lights, not bothering to inform his partner what his partner already knows: they're taking a rest. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIIS PROJECTS--NIGHT \n13 Zebra sits in the quiet dark. Larry puffs a cigarette. \nFRANK Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else? \nLARRY Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots. \nLarry tosses the cigarette out the window, leans against the door jab, closes his eyes. In a second he's asleep. \nFrank turns down the radio volume: the calls are fewer and further between now. Frank leans back, tries to rest: \n", "test2_true": "TIMECUT: radio wakes Frank from his reverie. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Zebra. One-three Zebra. (Frank opens eyes) Zebra, answer the radio. Come on, I've got one for you. Pick up the radio and push the button on the side and speak into the front. \nFRANK (answering call) Zebra. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Male bleeding, corner of Houston and One. No further information. \nFRANK Ten-four. \nFrank hangs up, bangs Larry's steering wheel: \nFRANK (CONT'D) We have a call Chief. Somebody's bleeding, Houston and First. \nLarry instinctively reaches for the ignition key, starts the engine, drops the ambulance into gear, hits lights, jerks the EMS bus away, still half asleep. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOUSTON & FIRST--NIGHT \n13 Zebra coming to a bone jarring stop at the corner. Getting out of the techie seat, Frank sees Noel, his face bloody, charging at him. \nNOEL Kill me! \nNoel has sliced up a tire and fastened the pieces with string over his shoulders. Tin cans circle his wrists and ankles. One hand carries a broken bottle, the other a stringless violin. \nFrank jumps back inside as Noel rams the window, leaving stains from his blood-matted dreadlocks. Larry calls for backup: medics, police, firemen, anybody. \nThe side window glass bends as Noel rams his head against it. Frank reaches for the short club between the seats; Noel holds the jagged bottle to his neck. \nFRANK Noel, don't! \nNoel drops the bottle. Frank rolls down the window. \nLARRY He's crazy. \nFRANK You really think so? \nNOEL See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert. \nFRANK You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. \nNOEL No, no medicine! \nNoel swings his bloody dreadlocks: Frank ducking, getting splattered anyway, rolling up the window. \nLARRY He got you. \nA BLACK PUNK calls from the crowd: \nBLACK PUNK Do it! Man wants to die. Take him out! I know how to kill that mother. (points a finger) Pop, pop. \nNoel, spraying blood, chases the Punk. The crowd scatters. Noel trips, falls to the sidewalk. Frank, carrying the short bat, gets out, walks over, hunches beside Noel: \nFRANK Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed. \nNOEL Oh man, do you mean that? (smiles) Thank you man, thank you. How? \nFRANK Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas. \nA siren draws closer, Noel gets to his feet as Larry opens the rear doors. \nNOEL I think pills. Yes, pills, definitely. \n", "test2_id": 2773, "test3_input": "INT. ELEVATOR--DAY \nThe dinged metal doors shudder shut as Frank follows Mary into the graffittied elevator. It jumps three feet upwards, stops, then continues, metal scraping concrete at each passing floor. \nMARY I shouldn't have asked you to come. \nFRANK You asked me not to come. \nMARY Promise you won't go inside. \nFRANK Fifteen minutes. \nMARY I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time. \nFRANK We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. \nMARY Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault. \nThe elevator jerks to a stop; the doors open. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SIXTEENTH FLOOR--MORNING \nMary turns to Frank: \nMARY You go on home, okay. I'm fine, really. I don't need you. Thanks. \nMary pushes the bell at 16M. KANITA, 25, wearing a paisley robe, opens the doors and says: \nKANITA Hey Cy, guess who's here? \nCOATES (O.S.) Mary ... \nThe elevator doors close on Frank. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOBBY--MORNING \nFrank paces past the sleeping security guard, checks his watch. \nHe presses the elevator button. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OASIS--MORNING \nThe door to 16M opens: \nKANITA Can I help you? \nFRANK Mary Burke. She's a friend. \nKANITA She's not here. \nFrank pushes past her. \nKANITA (CONT'D) Wait a minute. You can't go in. \nCY COATES, 45, light-skinned black, stands in the smoky room. Dark curtained windows block the sunlight; a dirty fish tank casts a green glow across the beat-up furniture. \nA large framed photo of a volcano hangs over the couch. \n", "test3_true": "KANITA He looks like a cop. \nCOATES He's not a cop, he's a medic. (extends hand) I'm CY Coates. \nFRANK Frank Pierce. \nCOATES Mary said you might be coming. \nFRANK Where is she? \nCOATES Sleeping in the back. \nFRANK She asked me to pick her up. \nCOATES I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it? \nFRANK I better just go in and see her. \nKanita sits on the sofa next to an unshaven sleeping man. Coates gestures: \nCOATES I call this the Oasis. Refuge from the world out there. Did you know two people were shot in this building last week? \nFrank heads down the hall toward the rear of the apartment; Coates follows. They pass an open door where inside TIGER, a fat man with dried blood running down the corner of his mouth, sits punching computer keys at a desk. \nCOATES (CONT'D) Careful. That's the Tiger. The lady's down the hall. Welcome to Sunrise Enterprises, Frank, the stress-free factory. \nIn the NEXT ROOM Mary lies on a mattress on the floor, yellow sheet pulled up to her neck. Frank leans over her: \nFRANK Mary. Mary, we've got to get going. \nMARY (groggy) No, no. \nCOATES She wanted something to help her sleep. \nFRANK Mary, we really have to go. \nMary blindly swings her fist at him, collapses unconscious back to the mattress. \nCOATES Frank, she's suffered enough. She's okay, I promise. (puts hand on Frank's shoulder) C'mon, Frank. \nCoates escorts Frank back to the LIVING ROOM. \nCOATES (CONT'D) I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. \nFRANK (sits) Got a beer? \nCy sits across from him, pulls out a pin-sized joint, lights it: \nCOATES That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these. \nFRANK Did you give Mary something called Red Death? \nCOATES Red Death? (passes joint to Kanita) Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that. \nFRANK I should be going. I just quit. \nCOATES Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. (offers white pill) You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. (Frank hesitates) Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water. \nFrank watches as Kanita gets up, walks to the kitchen. Coates places the pill in his hand. \nFRANK Is this what you gave Mary? \nCOATES That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle. \n", "test3_id": 2774}

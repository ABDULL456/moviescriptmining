{"train": "\"Bringing Out The Dead\", early draft, by Paul Schrader \nBRINGING OUT THE DEAD \nFirst draft (11/7/97) \nPaul Schrader \nFrom the novel by Joseph Connelly \nAfter World War One it was called Shell Shock. \nAfter World War Two it was called Battle Fatigue. \nAfter Vietnam it was called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. \nFrank Pierce, 28, drives an EMS vehicle for Our Lady of Mercy Hospital, New York City. He has been a paramedic for five years. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS--NIGHT \nAn EMS \"bus\" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian canyons of New York. \nFRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, \"EMS\" gold logo on one collar, \"OLM\" on the other. \"Our Lady of Mercy Paramedic\" is inscribed in white across the back of his navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves, beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight, collapsible baton. \nLARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash. \nFrank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes, beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons. \nDispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: \"Ladder 4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32. 13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire. Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out, says she's going into cardiac arrest ...\" \nFrank's detached voice speaks over the urban landscape: \nFRANK (V.O.) Thursday started out with a bang: a gunshot to the chest on a drug deal gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight-- all the elements in place for a long weekend. I was good at my job: there were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me and my mind worked with a cool authority I had never known. But in the last year I had started to lose that control. Things had turned bad. I hadn't saved anyone for months. I just needed a few slow nights, a week without tragedy followed by a couple of days off. \nThe radio continues: \"Zebra, 13Z, 524 East 17--\" \nLARRY (on radio) We're there. \nThe ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage walk-ups. Frank and Larry jump out: Frank lugs the EKG monitor and airway bag, Larry the drug box, yellow oxygen pack slung over his shoulder. Neighbors crowd around. \nOLD WOMAN Which apartment? Which apartment? \nFRANK Move back. Where's the stairs? 5A. \nOLD WOMAN Oh Jesus, it's Mr. Burke. \nThe front door opens, a young boy holding it. \nAuthor's note: in emergency situations, either on the street or in the hospital, it is assumed there is continual background noise--voices, sirens, cries, questions, etc. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TENEMENT STAIRWELL--NIGHT \nFour flights up: Frank and Larry climbing rotting steps, gray-yellow painted walls, red doors with three locks each, Larry, out of breath, his stomach rolling around like a bowling ball in a bag. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BURKE APARTMENT--NIGHT \nThey enter 5A. MRS. BURKE, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. Someone leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr. Burke, 60, lies unmoving, stretched on the bed. A young woman, MARY BURKE, 24, kneels over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth. \nJOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm: \nCUT TO: \nINT. AMBULANCE--NIGHT \nLarry climbing through the back doors, sitting in the jumpseat at the stretcher's head as Frank hangs IV bags, replugs EKG wires that have come loose. \nFrank looks up, sees Mary entering; he takes her arm, turns her toward the rear doors: \nFRANK Help your family. Ride with your mother and brother. (she hesitates) Help your family. They need you more. Help yourself. \nMary steps out, stands in the red flashing light as Larry closes the door, Frank climbs in the driver's seat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SECOND AVENUE--NIGHT \nThe EMS bus cruises up Second. Frank checks the side mirror: John, Mary and Mrs. Burke pull behind in a black Ford. Seeing their faces, Frank flips the lights and siren on. It's too late to help Mr. Burke, but it's important to the family that it look urgent. Frank watches passing lights, cars, faces: \nFRANK (V.O.) I needed to concentrate because my mind tended to wander on these short trips. It was the neighborhood I grew up in and where I had worked most as a paramedic, and it held more ghosts per square foot than any other. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OUR LADY OF MERCY--NIGHT \nLarry and Frank's 13 Zebra ambulance lined up beside two others outside a blazing \"Emergency\" sign on the crowded side street. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY ER--NIGHT \nEvery large city has a hospital Emergency Room so replete with trauma, violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet \"Knife and Gun Club.\" On Manhattan's Lower East Side it's our Lady Of Mercy, aka, Our Lady of Misery. \nER: a white-lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with old framed Playbills. Four rows of six plastic chairs face a TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled with backed-up drunks, assault victims and \"regulars,\" bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor, getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and have a smoke. \nLarry and Frank wheeling Burke in, two IV lines, each connected to an elbow, tangled in EKG cables. Two LACERATED RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS, the large black sunglassed security guard. He looks up from his television guide: \nGRISS Hey partner. Your man does not look well. They're not gonna appreciate you inside. \nFRANK (pumping Ambu-bag) Griss, let us in. \nGRISS Things are backing up. \nGriss pushes a button, activating the automatic door, striking the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the hall. Larry and Frank wheel Burke inside. A pleading family tries to follow. Griss stretches out his hand: \nGRISS (CONT'D) You can't go in there, folks. \nMary, John and Mrs. Burke rush in from the street, hoping some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital, approach the sign-in desk. \nFrank and Larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall-- a passage nicknamed \"Skid Row\" leading past triage NURSE CONSTANCE's station. \nNURSE CONSTANCE Just keep moving. Don't even slow down. \nNurse Constance turns back to the nervous man seated beside her: \nNURSE CONSTANCE (CONT'D) Sir, you say you've been snorting cocaine for three days and now you feel your heart is beating too fast and you would like us to help you. To tell the truth, I don't see why I should. If I'm mistaken, correct me. Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we push it up your nose? \nLarry and Frank slow at the last Skid Row stretchers. On one, NOEL, a young dark-skinned man with chaotic mess of dreadlocks, pulls feverishly at his restraints: \nNOEL For God's sake, give me some water. \nFrom the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like prize eggplants replies: \nBIG FEET Shut up! Goddamn civilians. \nShe points to Burke. His monitor is ringing like a fire alarm. Hazmat and Crupp rush over, wave to others: \nHAZMAT (CONT'D) Crupp, start CPR. Milagros, get me an epi. Odette wake up Dr. Stark. Tell him I need a blood gas, stat. \nAs the staff crowds around Burke, pulling the paddles from off the monitor, Frank, pushing his stretcher away, notices Big Feet climb onto his infected feet, hobble over, work to untie Noel. \nNOEL Bless you sir, bless you. \nBIG FEET Shut up. \nFrank heads down Skid Row pushing the stretcher, passing Nurse Constance speaking with a man with a gash over his eye: \nNURSE CONSTANCE ... so you get drunk every day and you fall down. Tell me why we should help you when you're going to get drunk tomorrow and fall down again? \nFrank pushes the automatic door button--and is suddenly hit from behind by Noel. The stretcher spins sideways. Noel dives out the doors for the water fountain, snorting up water like a bull. Mary Burke, standing with her family, looks at Frank. \nFRANK (stock reply) He's very very sick. \nMARY I know him. That's Noel. \nFRANK We'd better go outside. Quickly. \nFrank and Mary step out into the humid night. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--NIGHT \nChecking behind then, Frank stops. Mary pauses before she speaks: \nMARY Is there any chance? \nFRANK (shakes head) I guess there's always a chance. \nThe doors break open. Noel comes flying out, bounces on the sidewalk. Griss, in the doorway, closes the doors. \nMary goes over to Noel: \nMARY Noel, Noel, it's me, Mary. From 17th Street. \nNOEL Mary, Mary, Mary. I'm so thirsty. They won't give me anything to drink. Please, Mary. \nMARY (heading inside) I'll get you some. \nFrank watches: Mary returns with a cup of water, gives it to a grateful Noel. \nFRANK I wouldn't do that. (Noel drinks) The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder. \nMARY It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water. \nMary starts to cry. Frank fumbles in his pocket, finds a tissue, gives it to her. \nMARY (CONT'D) My father's dying, Noel. \nNOEL Oh Mary, Mary, Mary. \nNoel hugs her clumsily, his shoulders bobbing. Frank watches, realizing this is what he should have done for her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EAST SIDE STREETS--NIGHT \n13 Zebra cruising down Avenue C, Frank at the wheel, Larry shotgun. \nLARRY You're burned out. \nRADIO DISPATCHER One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you. \nLARRY You see, he's giving it to us anyway. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks. \nLARRY (screams) No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing. \nFRANK Mr. Oh. \nLARRY It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time. \nLARRY Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds. \nPause. Neither moves. \nLARRY Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. (picks up the mike) You can do that for me at least. (keys mike) Three Zebra. \nRADIO DISPATCHER Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh. \nLARRY Ten-four. (Frank starts the engine) Don't go. Not this time. \nFRANK (driving off) Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk. \nLARRY It's not our job to taxi drunks around. \nFRANK They'll just keep calling. \nLARRY Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIRST & ST. MARKS--NIGHT \nFrank and Larry standing over Mr. Oh, 40, surrounded by street people. Oh lays curled up beside his wheelchair, wearing a black garbage bag with holes cut out for his arms, his pants around his knees. \nMALE STREET PERSON #1 He's bad mister. He ain't eaten nuthin all day, he's seizing and throwing up. \nLARRY (hand over nose) So what's different? \nMALE STREET PERSON #1 He says his feet hurt. \nFRANK Well why didn't you say so? \nLARRY He's drunk. \nMALE STREET PERSON #2 He's sick. You gotta help him. \nLARRY He's fine. He can walk to the hospital. \nFEMALE STREET PERSON Walk? You crazy? He's in a wheelchair. \nLARRY Don't start that. I've seen him walk. He walks better than me. \nFrank crouches over Oh, tries to pull Oh's pants over his white, dirt-stained ass. Oh moans: \nMR. OH Oh, oh, oh. \nMARY That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside. \nLarry jumps theatrically out of the ambulance, swings the mop wildly over his head: \nLARRY That's it! I can't do it anymore! \nMary laughs once, less than a second. She notices blood stains on Frank's shirt: \nMARY That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he? \nFRANK Yes. \nMARY He's dead, huh? \nFRANK Yes. \nMARY (pause) I think this place stinks. \nFRANK Our Lady of Misery. \nMARY Did you see my father? \nFRANK No. \nMARY It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me. \nFRANK He's working a double shift. \nMARY Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean? \nHe does. \nMARY (CONT'D) My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance. \nFRANK She should go home. \nMARY I'd take her, but then who would stay here? \nFrank looks at her, trying to say the right thing. He notices Mrs. Burke coming from inside. \nFRANK Here she is. \nMrs. Burke, dazed, steps out. They join her. \nMRS. BURKE It wasn't him. \nMARY You saw him? \nMRS. BURKE They showed me someone. It wasn't him. It wasn't my husband. \nFRANK Mrs. Burke, please, they'll take care of him. You should go home now. \nMRS. BURKE I should know my own husband. They wouldn't let me see him. \nShe drifts away. Frank speaks to Mary: \nFRANK Larry and I'll drop her back home. Help me get her to the ambulance. \nMRS. BURKE You want some coffee? I have some apple sauce cake too. \nThey walk Mrs. Burke to 13 Zebra. \nMARY Thank you. \nCAPT. BARNEY I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that? \nFRANK I don't think a week's gonna do it. \nCAPT. BARNEY I'm sorry, Pierce. (hands Frank keys) You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SECOND AVENUE--NIGHT \n12 Young heading downtown, lights off, slowing down for cross streets. At the wheel: MARCUS, 45, black, reserved, chin erect, seeming too old for the job. Frank rides techie. \nMARCUS My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking? \nFRANK The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. \nMARCUS Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last. \nFRANK The ghosts-- \nMARCUS You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy? \nFRANK I think the worst is over. \nMARCUS It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. (points to Frank's chest) \nLOVE, a black, tough-talking female dispatcher, comes on the radio: \nDISPATCHER LOVE Twelve Young. (beat) Let's go, Twelve Young. Answer the radio. \nFRANK Hey, Marcus, it's Love. I haven't heard her in months. \nMARCUS She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy. \nFRANK Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? (Marcus looks away) She hit you with a bottle? \nMARCUS She loves me the way no woman ever has. \nDISPATCHER LOVE Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself? \nMARCUS I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good. (picks up mike) Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival. \nDISPATCHER LOVE I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance. \nMARCUS Ten-four, hon. (to Frank) This is for you. \nMarcus flips on the lights and siren. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NINTH & AVENUE C--NIGHT \nMarcus grabs the yellow airway bag, leaving Frank to lug the three heavier pieces as they push their way through the crowd toward a black jacketed DOORMAN holding a walkie-talkie: \nMARCUS (to crowd) I hope we're not late from you guys holding us up here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLUB BACKSTAGE--NIGHT \nThe Doorman leads Frank and Marcus through the smoky graffiti- covered backstage ante-rooms to a cubicle where a knot of club types and band members hover around IB BANGIN, 18 year- old white rapper, face up, blank-eyed and breathless on dirt- impacted carpet. Hip-hop music echoes from the club PA. \nFrank kneels beside IB Bangin, taking a pulse, realizing it's the gray and black stage makeup making him seem DOA. He pulls up IB Bangin's eyelid, shines a light into the pupil. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY ER--NIGHT \nIB Bangin sitting with Nurse Constance in triage. Past Griss, Frank talks with Dr. Hazmat: \nFRANK That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone. \nHAZMAT Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin. \nFRANK What do you think? \nHAZMAT Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints. \nFRANK The family know? \nHAZMAT I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone. \nFrank nods, walks down Skid Row, passing Nurse Constance lecturing IB Bangin: \nNURSE CONSTANCE ... you put poison in your veins and now that you're breathing again you can't wait to say thank you and go back to poison shopping. Well, since we saved your life, maybe you could do us a favor and stop breathing in another city next time ... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIRST AVE--NIGHT \n12 Young heading up the avenue. \nMARCUS I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside? \nFRANK Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story. \nMARCUS No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him. \nFRANK Make a left here. I want to stop. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BURKE APT. BUILDING--NIGHT \nMarcus stops the ambulance on 17th Street. \nFRANK I'll be right back. \nFrank gets out, walks over to the intercom, pushes the button for 5A. Mary answers: \nMARY (V.O.) Yes? \nFRANK Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news. \nMARY (V.O.) I'll be right down. \nMary appears in a white sweater and simple gray skirt like schoolgirls wear. The dark makeup is gone. She looks happy. \nMARY (CONT'D) He's better, isn't he? \nFRANK Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know. \nMARY I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice. \nFRANK You look so different. \nMARY I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM--NIGHT \nPassing Griss (reading anti-white agitprop) and waiting room regulars, Frank leads Mary to a small rectangular paramedic locker area: sofa, desk, two banks of gray lockers, walls decorated with hospital rules and regulations. \nFRANK He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign. \nMARY You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist. \nHe sits across from her, wishing he could be in three seats at once, each to watch her from a different angle. \nFRANK That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own. \nMARY He's better, though, right? \nFRANK (reluctant) He's better. \nMARY Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean? \nMarcus enters with a small pizza and two cokes. \nMARCUS Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up. \nFRANK Thanks. \nMarcus exits. \nMARY I'm not really hungry. \nShe says as she picks up a slice of cheese pizza. \nMARY (CONT'D) My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ... \nFRANK It's best not to ... (off her look) It's good pizza, huh? \nMARY Not as good as Nino's. \nFRANK You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle? \nMARY Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood? \nFRANK I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament. \nMARY On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school? \nFRANK We moved out after that. Upstate. \nMARY Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents \nFRANK They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess. \nMARY You married? \nFRANK Ah, no. I was. (beat) It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too. \nPause.   This thought hangs in the air. From outside: a BELLICOSE DRUNK is escorted into the ER. \nDRUNK (O.S.) White cocksuckers! Get your--Ow! \nMARY Is it always this bad in here? I mean, how does anyone survive? \nFRANK It's been bad lately, but it's always bad. \nMARY How long you been doing this? \nFRANK I didn't kill you. \nMarcus, not hearing \"Rose's\" voice, replies: \nMARCUS No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift. \nFRANK I need a drink, that's all. \nDispatcher Love's voice cuts through: \nDISPATCHER LOVE Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you. \nMARCUS She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio. \nDISPATCHER LOVE I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service. \nMARCUS (keys radio) Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me. \nDISPATCHER LOVE You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information. \nMARCUS Ten-four, hon. \nMarcus hits the siren. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RUNDOWN TENEMENT--NIGHT \nFrank and Marcus standing in a no-income apartment with their cardiac equipment. MARIA, a 17 year-old Hispanic girl, lies moaning and breathing shallow on a ratty sofa. CARLOS, her equally young boyfriend, watches anxiously, holding a candle for light. \nMARCUS Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first. \nFRANK (to Maria) What's wrong. \nCarlos speaks broken English: \nCARLOS No English. She has terrible pain in her belly. \nFRANK (hands on stomach) Pregnant. \nCARLOS No, no, that's impossible. \nFRANK Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada? \nMaria shakes her head, looks away. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Can you walk? Puedes caminar? \nCARLOS She say she in great pain. \nFRANK Thanks for the translation. (to Maria) What's your name? Nombre? \nMARIA Maria. \nFRANK Let's have a look. \nMARCUS (to Carlos) You know each other a long time? \nCARLOS Two years. Ever since we left island. \nMARCUS In that time, you ever have sex? \nCARLOS Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze. \nFrank looking at the EKG monitor--a green flatline--backs away. \nMISHRA Fuck. \nNURSE CONSTANCE Nothing. \nFrank walking away, not looking where he's going, backs into Noel's gurney. \nNOEL Excuse me, sir, excuse me, I would please trouble you for one cup of water. The smallest thing in the world to ask for, water. A man is dying and that is me. \nNoel, his face battered from his encounter with Walls, pulls at his restraints, howls: \nNOEL (CONT'D) For days I've eaten nothing but sand, O Lord, I waited so long. \nHazmat looks over: \nHAZMAT Christ. Who the hell woke him up? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANAL STREET--NIGHT \n12 Young on the road again, sky turning blue. \nFRANK Don't give me that look. \nMARCUS What look? \nFRANK You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look. \nMARCUS We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. \nFRANK I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding. \nMarcus reaches under the seat, pulls a pint of vodka, a quart of orange juice and two cups out of an old gym bag, passes them to Frank. \nMARCUS The bar is now open. \nFrank mixes a screwdriver for Marcus, straight vodka for himself. \nFRANK I hate vodka. \nMARCUS Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking. \nFRANK (pours drink) I'll drink to that. \nMARCUS (raises cup) Here's to the greatest job in the world. \nFRANK (knocks vodka back) Greatest job in the world. \nDISPATCHER LOVE Twelve Young, I have priorities holding. Pick up the radio. \nFRANK Don't do it, Marcus. Tell her the bus died, our radio's not working, our backs are out. Tell her we're too drunk to take any more calls. \nMARCUS Let's do it! (keys mike) It's Marcus, Love, only for you. \nDISPATCHER LOVE Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A. \nMARCUS Ten-four. \nMarcus hits the sirens and lights, accelerates to full speed. The vodka spills; Frank grabs the dash. \nMARCUS (CONT'D) I'm coming, Love! I'm coming! \nINT. ELEVATOR--DAY \nThe dinged metal doors shudder shut as Frank follows Mary into the graffittied elevator. It jumps three feet upwards, stops, then continues, metal scraping concrete at each passing floor. \nMARY I shouldn't have asked you to come. \nFRANK You asked me not to come. \nMARY Promise you won't go inside. \nFRANK Fifteen minutes. \nMARY I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time. \nFRANK We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. \nMARY Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault. \nThe elevator jerks to a stop; the doors open. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SIXTEENTH FLOOR--MORNING \nMary turns to Frank: \nMARY You go on home, okay. I'm fine, really. I don't need you. Thanks. \nMary pushes the bell at 16M. KANITA, 25, wearing a paisley robe, opens the doors and says: \nKANITA Hey Cy, guess who's here? \nCOATES (O.S.) Mary ... \nThe elevator doors close on Frank. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOBBY--MORNING \nFrank paces past the sleeping security guard, checks his watch. \nHe presses the elevator button. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE OASIS--MORNING \nThe door to 16M opens: \nKANITA Can I help you? \nFRANK Mary Burke. She's a friend. \nKANITA She's not here. \nFrank pushes past her. \nKANITA (CONT'D) Wait a minute. You can't go in. \nCY COATES, 45, light-skinned black, stands in the smoky room. Dark curtained windows block the sunlight; a dirty fish tank casts a green glow across the beat-up furniture. \nA large framed photo of a volcano hangs over the couch. \nNo language, only brute power. You can't believe how relaxing it is. \nKanita returns with a glass of water, gives it to Frank; Coates stands, feeds the fish. \nCOATES (CONT'D) Frank, I'm trying to help you.  Drink up. \nFrank swallows the white pill, drinks the water. He places his arms on the chair: \nFRANK I guess I'll be going. \nCOATES Just take it easy. \nFrank looks around the smoke-filled room. Kanita walks over, extends her hand. \nKANITA Take my pulse. (he does) It's good, isn't it? \nFRANK Perfect. \nKANITA I knew it. I was wrong about you. You're not so bad. \nKanita runs her hand across his shoulders. Frank starts to nod. The room getting warm and dark. His eyelids lower: sleep, precious sleep. \nCUT TO: \nFRANK'S ROSE DREAM \nVoices and sounds echo through the purple haze as Frank's mind drifts in time and space. Action and sounds slow, speed up, distort--intermix with the Oasis--as Frank goes back: \nThis is how it begins: the last time, the first time ... \nLarry exits 13 Zebra as Rose, 18, wearing a yellow rain slicker, falls to her knees in the miasmic dream stank, onto the sidewalk, then onto her back. From forty feet away Frank, seeing her reach for a parking meter, grabbing the tube kit, running. \nRose gasping for breath, Frank falling to his knees, lifting her tongue, prying her teeth apart, slipping the blade between her lips--Rose not breathing: waiting for her to inhale, shooting the tube down her vocal cords. Larry listening to lung sounds, belly sounds: \nLARRY You're in the stomach! \nFRANK You sure? \nROSE Rose! \nFRANK Huh? \nROSE My name. Rose. \nLARRY You're in the stomach, man. \nFrank pulling the tube out, trying again. \nSomewhere: CY Coates laughs. \nLARRY (CONT'D) You're in the stomach! Let me try. \nFRANK One more time! \nRose going blue, pulse rate dropping, EKG Slowing: Jim Morrison singing. \nLARRY Stomach again. \nFRANK No way! \nLarry ripping the tube from Frank's hands, taking over, pushing Frank aside, trying CPR, intubating Rose, air moving into her lungs--it doesn't matter. Rose is gone. \nFrank hears a SCREAM: it's his own voice. \nMary grabs the railing, heads up the stairs. \nMARY What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself. \nFRANK I need to sit down a minute. \nMARY Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has. \nMary opens the door to her first floor apartment; Frank follows. The room is clean and feminine. Unframed water colors stacked against the wall atop a desk. A black lab greets Mary, she pets him. Frank slumps on the sofa. \nMARY (CONT'D) I've been clean two years now. I got a job. I paint when I'm home. Don't bother anybody. Then all this shit happens. \nFrank keels over onto his side, his head hitting a cushion, eyes closed, dog licking his cheek. \nMARY (CONT'D) Oh no you don't. You can't stay here. \nHe's asleep, the sound of her crying fading in his head. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. MARY'S APT.--NIGHT \nFADE IN: a passing siren wakes Frank. He thinks back, looking around the darkened room, realizes where he is. The dog comes over, licks his hand. \nFRANK Hello, I'm Frank. Mary's friend. A very close friend who loves animals. \nHe removes the blanket Mary has laid over him, stands: \nFRANK (CONT'D) Hello? \nFrank walks cautiously through the dark, finds a bathroom lit by a glowing Mickey Mouse switch. He flips on the switch: a string of green and red Christmas lights glow. Three types of soap sit on the sink. He turns on the faucet: \nFRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D) I washed my face with three kinds of soap, each smelling like a different season. It felt good to be in a woman's room again, especially a woman who wasn't comatose or severely disabled. I felt that perhaps I had turned a corner, like I saved someone, though I didn't know who. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMS GARAGE OFFICE--NIGHT \nFrank standing at Captain Barney's desk. \nCAPT. BARNEY You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls. \nFRANK No ... \nCAPT. BARNEY I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time. (hands him keys) I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise. \nFRANK What if there is no tomorrow? \nCAPT. BARNEY Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug. (to Miss Williams) I love this guy. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--NIGHT \nFrank walks toward Sixteen XRay as Walls gets out of the front seat. The EMS vehicle is dented and rusted, a relic of wars and a hodgepodge of parts. \nWALLS Frank, what do you know. It's you and me again tonight, the Rough Riders, tearing up the streets just like old times. (kicks the front tire) This old bus is a warrior, Frank, just like us. I have tried to kill him and he will not die. I have a great respect for that. \nFrank makes a \"be right back\" gesture, walks into ER. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY ER--NIGHT \nFrank places an open drug box on the stretcher, pulls out an IV set, wraps a tourniquet around his left bicep. \nFRANK I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. (injects himself) Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got. \nWALLS Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets. \nFrank crawls back in front carrying the IV bag, puts on the oxygen mask, turns on the main tanks, takes a deep hit. \nFRANK (pulls off mask) These are hard times, Tom. \nWALLS Yeah. Great, isn't it? \nFRANK Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me. \nWALLS Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives. \nFRANK Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso. \nWALLS Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off. \nWalls hits the sirens, accelerates. \nFRANK The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. \nWALLS Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto. \nWalls turns up the radio, drums his hands against the wheel. \nDISPATCHER Okay, units, it's suicide hour. Fourteen Boy, I show you in the hospital sixty minutes but I know you're in the diner on 14th. Put down the burger, I got a call for you around the corner, 14 and 3rd, a man with a noose around his neck and nothing to hang it on. Sixteen XRay, don't even think about getting coffee, I have a call for you too. \nWALLS (on radio) Sixteen XTerminator here. We like our coffee bloody. Make it good--my partner's dying to help someone. \nDISPATCHER You're in luck, X: your patient awaits you with bleeding wrists on Avenue C and Fourth. \nFrank pulls the IV needle out of his arm, searches the glove compartment: \nFRANK Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it? \nWALLS (hitting the gas) Look out! \n16 XRay lurches forward. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AVENUE C AND 4TH--NIGHT \n16 XRay brakes to a stop before a duster of derelicts, junkies and night people. Two DRUNKS are trying to help a friend with CUT WRISTS. \nWALLS What the hell's going on? \nDRUNK #1 You've gotta take him to the hospital. He tried to kill himself. Show him your wrist. Show A. \nCut Wrists gets up, leans against the ambulance, shaking. \nDRUNK #1 (CONT'D) See, he ain't right. \nWALLS Hold it. I will not take anyone anywhere against his will. This is America. People have rights. \nDRUNK #2 He was bleeding before. He kept spilling his beer. I gave him mouth- to-mouth. \nWALLS You're lucky you didn't kill him. (to Cut Wrists) We're going to hear it straight from the loony's mouth. Are you crazy? Did you try to bump yourself off? \nCUT WRISTS (salivatory) Yesssss. \nCOATES (CONT'D) Isn't it beautiful? When the fires start to fall, then the strongest rule it all. I love this city. \nThe torch breaks the spike free: Frank and Coates FREE FALL three feet, jerk to a stop. Cy yelps. The crowd cheers from below. \nFrank now grabbing, holding Coates tightly--Frank's hands the only thing keeping Coates from falling--as the cops hoist them up. \nCOP (to Frank) Good thing we buckled you in, huh? \nCOATES What about me? Who's supposed to buckle me? \nCOP (to 2nd cop) I thought you did. \n2ND COP I thought you did. \nCOP (to Coates) I'm so sorry, sir. \nThe cops lift Frank and Coates onto the balcony. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--NIGHT \n16 XRay parked in front. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY CRITICAL CARE--NIGHT \nFrank walking out of the restroom wiping water off his face, looking at the gurney where Coates lies on his side, metal spike still sticking through his hip, IV line running to his arm, eyes closed. Nurses walk past Coates: he's stabilized, waiting his turn. CY, take a number. \nFrank spots Hazmat at Burke's cubicle, walks over. \nHAZMAT Nurse Crupp, we're going to need some Valium here. He's waking up again. \nThe ventilator alarm goes off as Burke pulls at his restraints. \nHAZMAT (CONT'D) (urgent) Where's that Valium? \nNurse Crupp walks briskly over, injects needle into one of Burke's IV bags. \nBurke's voice speaks in Frank's head: \nBURKE'S VOICE Don't. Don't do it. \nHAZMAT Give me a hand, Frank. I've got to get something between those teeth. \nFrank helps Hazmat force in a bite stick. The monitor alarm cuts off, the ventilator starts up again, pumping air in, pulling air out. \nHAZMAT (CONT'D) You can't believe how much he's improved. \nFRANK How many times have you shocked him tonight? \nHAZMAT Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours. \nFRANK What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? \nHAZMAT (laughs) That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it? \nFRANK A medical miracle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY WAITING ROOM--NIGHT \nDISPATCHER Sixteen XRay, a man at the bus terminal shot three years ago says his arm hurts. \nFrank looks at a group of girls exiting an after-hours club: every one a Rose. Rose faces. \nFRANK C'mon, Tom, pick up a job. \nWALLS You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call. \nFRANK Let's get in a fight, then. \nWALLS Who with? \nFRANK That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die. \nWalls hits the accelerator: the old bus jerks forward: \nFRANK (CONT'D) Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something. \nWALLS What do you want to break? \nFRANK (taking a drink) I don't know--let's break some windows. \nWALLS Why? \nFRANK Destruction, distraction. I feel the need. \nWALLS You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. \nFRANK What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom. \nWALLS Let me think. \nTom hits the siren as he swings wildly around a stopped cab and its turban-headed driver: \nWALLS (CONT'D) Classic cabbie move. (to driver) Hey, swammy, that's called a crosswalk. You stop before it, not on it! \nWalls turns onto a cross street, spots Noel standing by a Mustang, baseball bat on his shoulder. He wears yesterday's blood-stained clothes, cut tires tied to his shoulders and elbows, chest and belly wrapped with steel wire. \nWALLS (CONT'D) I know who to work over. Him. \nWalls slows as Noel lifts the bat, swings it into the Mustang's front window, shattering it, puts the bat down, using it like a cane as he walks to the next parked car. \nWALLS (CONT'D) This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term \"menace to society\" was made up for him. \nFRANK He's crazy. He can't help it. \nWALLS (stops ambulance) Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again. \nNoel reaches the next car, a Bronco, carefully hefts the bat, smashes it through the windshield. \nWALLS (CONT'D) Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us-- \nFRANK Okay, whatta I do? \nWALLS If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. \nFRANK That's ridiculous. \nWALLS Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better. \nFRANK You learn that in the army? \nFRANK (CONT'D) Flatbush. \nFrank stands back, watching Walls and Noel like some static black and white TV screen from his childhood. Noel, trying to protect himself, cries out. \nWALLS (CONT'D) (swinging bat) To the moon, Alice! You little motherfucker! \nFrank charges forward into Walls, sending Tom, the baseball bat flying. Walls on the ground. Frank bends over Noel: Noel's face covered with blood, gasping for air, blowing red bubbles, convulsing. \nFRANK (to Walls) Get the kit! We're gonna tube him! \nWALLS Frank! \nFRANK Do it! \nWALLS (standing) Frank! \nFRANK (to Noel) We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right. (to Walls) Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear! \nWALLS You're crazy. \nNoel unconscious: Tom hurries down the alley toward the ambulance as Frank opens Noel's mouth. \nFRANK You're going to make it! You're going to make it! \nPressing Noel's chest, Frank lowers his mouth, starts CPR. His mouth to Noel's. In the distance: Walls' footsteps returning. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--NIGHT \n16 XRay parked out front: the sky is going blue. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERCY ER--NIGHT \nFrank and Tom, their shirts blood-stained, pushing Noel down Skid Row, past Griss, past Nurse Constance. Tom wheels, Frank carries the IV bag. \nNURSE CONSTANCE Take him straight through. \nGRISS Who got that funky motherfucker this time? \nFRANK (to Nurse Constance) Last show of the night. \nHAZMAT (arriving) Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp! (to Frank) Anybody else hurt? \nFRANK No. \nHAZMAT Crazy fucker. \nWalls pushes Noel into unit one. Frank looks over to unit three--Burke's cubicle is empty. \nFRANK Where's Burke? \nHAZMAT Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more. \nFrank nods, walks out. Behind, Walls helps Hazmat and Crupp place Noel on a bed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOM 212--NIGHT \nFrank Pierce walks down the hospital corridor, steps into room 212. \nBurke lies, tubed, wired and tied to life support. Blue light comes through the window. On the EKG monitor: a slow steady green endless line: up, down. \n", "test1_input": "MARY I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say. \nFRANK Even when you say the things, there's always more things. \nMARY Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father. \nFRANK Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now. \nMARY That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home. \nLarry walks back with a coffee for himself and a brown bag beer for Frank. \nLARRY Time to switch. I wheel, you heal. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE--NIGHT \n4:00am.  The EMS vehicle drives downtown. The city has transformed: a deserted city, inhabited by the hardcore: hardcore night-shift employees, hardcore party-goers, hardcore druggies, hardcore homeless, people with something special to do or nowhere to go. \nRADIO DISPATCHER 12 David on the corner of Thirty- eight and Two you'll find a three- car accident, two taxis and a taxi.

No further information ... \nLarry driving at a good clip, riding both the gas and the break pedals, enjoying the newfound freedom of movement. \nFRANK Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls. \nLARRY Relax, will you. \nFrank places both hands on the dash as Larry squeals around a corner. \nFRANK (V.O.) The biggest problem with not driving is that whenever there's a patient in back you're also in the back. The doors close, you're trapped. Four in the morning is always the worst time for me, just before dawn, just when you've been lulled into thinking it might be safe to close your eyes for one minute. That's when I first found Rose ... \nLarry slows down on a side street. Frank turns to watch a homeless man. The man looks back: it's Rose. The Rose face. \nFRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was on the sidewalk, not breathing. \nFrank turns to Larry: \nFRANK (CONT'D) I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night. \nLARRY You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that. \nFRANK Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight. \nLARRY You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here. \nFRANK Yeah, you're right. \nLarry pulls into the Jacob Riis projects by the river, slows to a stop.  Larry cuts the lights, not bothering to inform his partner what his partner already knows: they're taking a rest. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RIIS PROJECTS--NIGHT \n13 Zebra sits in the quiet dark. Larry puffs a cigarette. \nFRANK Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else? \nLARRY Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots. \nLarry tosses the cigarette out the window, leans against the door jab, closes his eyes.

HOUSTON & FIRST--NIGHT \n13 Zebra coming to a bone jarring stop at the corner. Getting out of the techie seat, Frank sees Noel, his face bloody, charging at him. \nNOEL Kill me! \nNoel has sliced up a tire and fastened the pieces with string over his shoulders. Tin cans circle his wrists and ankles. One hand carries a broken bottle, the other a stringless violin. \nFrank jumps back inside as Noel rams the window, leaving stains from his blood-matted dreadlocks. Larry calls for backup: medics, police, firemen, anybody. \nThe side window glass bends as Noel rams his head against it. Frank reaches for the short club between the seats; Noel holds the jagged bottle to his neck. \nFRANK Noel, don't! \nNoel drops the bottle. Frank rolls down the window. \nLARRY He's crazy. \nFRANK You really think so? \nNOEL See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert. \nFRANK You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. \nNOEL No, no medicine! \nNoel swings his bloody dreadlocks: Frank ducking, getting splattered anyway, rolling up the window. \nLARRY He got you. \nA BLACK PUNK calls from the crowd: \nBLACK PUNK Do it! Man wants to die. Take him out! I know how to kill that mother. (points a finger) Pop, pop. \nNoel, spraying blood, chases the Punk. The crowd scatters. Noel trips, falls to the sidewalk. Frank, carrying the short bat, gets out, walks over, hunches beside Noel: \nFRANK Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed. \nNOEL Oh man, do you mean that? (smiles) Thank you man, thank you. How? \nFRANK Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas. \nA siren draws closer, Noel gets to his feet as Larry opens the rear doors. \nNOEL I think pills.

(pushes Noel) You give my friend here any trouble and I'll kill you. \nNOEL Yes, at the hospital. \nWALLS This looks like a very bad man I took in a couple weeks ago, a man who'd been holding two priests hostage with a screwdriver. I told him if I ever caught him making trouble again I'd kick the murdering life outta him. \nFRANK It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering. \nWALLS No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid. \nWalls hauls back, swings at Noel; Noel ducks. \nWALLS (CONT'D) Stay still, dammit! \nWalls throws Noel against the bus, knocks him down, sets to kicking him. \nFRANK Don't do it, Tom! \nNoel moans. Larry sticks his head out the back of the bus: \nLARRY There's a double shooting three blocks- up.

(sets IV line) We got to get you off this thing without setting off bleeding. \nCops behind click on harnesses (\"You in?\" \"Yeah\" \"You in?\") attach straps to pitons they've hammered into the brick wall, bring out metal cutters and torches. \nFRANK (CONT'D) They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm. \nCOATES I can't hold up my head anymore. \nFrank passes the IV bag to one of the cops, holds Coates, head. CY relaxes his neck as SPARKS splay like fireworks beneath him, fall to the concrete. \nCOATES (CONT'D) So, Frank, am I going to live? \nFRANK You're going to live. \nCOATES I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place. \nFRANK I was tired. I needed a coffee. \nCOATES What about Kanita? \nFRANK Dead. \nCOATES That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank? \nFRANK No. \nCOATES Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot. \nFrank looks: the spike in Coates' hip starting to glow red. CY stretches his hand toward the skyline, his face backlit by raining acetylene sparks: \n", "test3_id": 2774}

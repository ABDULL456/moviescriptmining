CONTINUED: 
JONATHAN (anxious to hang up) Oh - okay, thanks- 
RUSSO                                                      (O.S.) Are you sure you didn't know Simone Forester? The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses... 
JONATHAN I told you before - 
RUSSO                                                      (O.S.) I remember what you said. (an unsettling silence) And you weren't at the Hudson two nights ago? 
JONATHAN I don't                                                    -- why are you- 
RUSSO             (O.S.) Turns out among credit card charges made that night, there was one with your name. The card was declined. 
JONATHAN I cancelled them all, the day they got stolen. 
RUSSO (O.S.) I see. I figured it didn't mean much - cards move quickly. It just struck me, you know.. The coincidence. Jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause. 
RUSSO                                                      (O.S.) By the way, the morgue confirmed strangulation as cause of death. He found trace fibres of Kevlar in her neck wound. 
JONATHAN Kevlar? 
RUSSO (O.S.) It's used in certain kinds of rope and string. Jonathan's eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze   to the hall closet door. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RUSSO      (O.S.) Mr. Messer? 
JONATHAN Yes                                                            - yes, I'm              -- 
RUSSO      (O.S.) Thought I lost you for a second. 
(PAUSE) Well, I won't keep you. You have a good night. Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door. In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone. 
SAME - MOMENTS LATER Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches for the phone, and dials... another number. 
JONATHAN I know, okay? I know your name isn't Wyatt Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I know you're trying to frame me for it, so - so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And where is she?! If you hurt her I swear to God I'll... Jonathan falters, unsure where he's going with this and realizing he's now talking to himself. 
COMPUVOICE 
TO-SEND-THIS-MESSAGE--PRESS-POUND-OR- simply-hang-up. To-erase-and-record-a-new- messa ge---press-Star. Jonathan hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder: 
JONATHAN It's me. I need to talk to you. He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something. Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy. QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his apartment, his trophy raised as a makeshift weapon. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied there's no one else here - when his home phone rings, startling him. RING... RING... RING... Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up: 
JONATHAN'S ANSWERING MACHINE This is Jonathan. Please leave a message. BEEEEP. A moment of hiss                                       - then: 
MALE VOICE (O.S. Jonathan? Jonathan whips to the phone - it sounds like Wyatt --- 
PETERSON                                                       (O.S.) Chet Peterson calling - -- only it's not. 
PETERSON                                                       (O.S.) I understand you were out today. I left messages on your cell but never heard back, so I thought I'd try you at home. He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the window at the dark night and empty street below. 
PETERSON                                                       (O.S.) Just want to make sure you're up to speed with Weiss Murphy, because the folks at Clute Nichols are expecting you... 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING 
Jonathan sits in a crowded car, dressed for work. 
PETERSON                                                       (V.0.) They're our biggest client, so needless to say, make them your top priority... Jonathan takes out the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper. He stares at it with a look of longing: this is his Priority- 
EXT. CHINATOWN -- DAY 
A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads. Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The photo is of Simone Forester.

Say, you're an American, aren't you?

(irascibly) 
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone! 
He shrugs his shoulders and slides back into his seat. 
37. FULL SHOT 
All is silent for a moment. Conway is writing on a small pad - which he rests on an uplifted knee. George is rummaging through a closet - rear of the cabin. 
38. MED. SHOT - GEORGE AND CONWAY 
Conway still writes, undisturbed. George reaches into the closet and emerges with a bottle of whiskey. His face lights up. 
GEORGE 
(holds up bottle) 
Hello! Look what I found! 
He crosses to Conway. 
GEORGE 
Just what I needed too. 
CONWAY 
(looks up - smiling) 
You? 
GEORGE 
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means. 
(hands him cup) 
Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me. 
(holds his cup up) 
Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary. 
Conway watches him, amused. George gulps down his drink. 
CONWAY 
(after a slight hesitation - downing his drink) 
Hurray! 
GEORGE 
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory! 
(dreamily) 
People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary." 
CONWAY 
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle. 
Conway takes the bottle from him and pours himself a second drink. 
GEORGE 
That's why they're sending for you, Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen. They need you. 
Conway, with a poured drink in hand, laughs. 
GEORGE 
All right, you can laugh if you want to. But who else can they get? Who else is there in all of England half the fighter, half the diplomat, who 
has half your knowledge of the foreign situation? They can't stop you now, Bob. 
Conway moodily pours himself a third. He downs the drink as we

INT. PLANE 
39. CLOSE SHOT OF CONWAY 
We find Conway, asleep in his seat, his head on his hands. George approaches and tenderly spreads a jacket over his shoulders. Conway stirs, opens an eye. 
CONWAY 
(drunkenly) 
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet? 
GEORGE 
Yes, Bob. 
CONWAY 
Did you say we saved ninety white people? 
GEORGE 
Yes. 
CONWAY 
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count. 
GEORGE 
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob. 
CONWAY 
Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries? 
(confidentially - screws up face) 
You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?" So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants 
(pause - drily) 
and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum. 
He starts to pour himself another drink. 
GEORGE 
You'd better not drink any more, Bob. You're not talking sense. 
Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles cynically. 
CONWAY 
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else. 
GEORGE 
Do try to sleep, Bob. 
CONWAY 
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep. 
He grunts and squirms. George tucks him in. 
CONWAY 
Did you ever notice the sunrise in China, George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful. 
He gets settled. George relaxes and, leaning back, shuts his eyes.

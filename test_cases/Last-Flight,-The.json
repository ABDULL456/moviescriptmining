{"test1_input": "THE LAST FLIGHT \nWritten by \nJohn Monk Saunders \nFADE IN \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT \nOn a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. \nAbruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES appear with every FIRING. \nOn the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose: \nWAR MONTAGE \nNothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of: \nCannon firing in all directions. \nMassive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. \nTroops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. \nAn entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. \nBrief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling. \nFASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC: \nMortar fire, explosions, smoke. \nA machine gunner fires. \nA soldier falls. \nInfantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. \nMore machine gunning. \nMore soldiers go down. \nA massive gun fires. \nSMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen. \nInfantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles. \nA bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes. \nA bomb drops from an airplane. \nAerial view of an exploding building. \nAnti-aircraft guns at work. \nPlanes in the air. \nA machine gun fires skyward. \nPlanes circle, filling the air. \nA single bi-plane. \nThe plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks into a grin. \nShep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see: \nAnother plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them. \nAn enemy plane arrives. \nThe enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns. \nBill and Francis' plane spins away. \nBill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to Francis' amusement. \nThe planes circle in the air. \nThe enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail as Cary watches. \nThe enemy pilot returns fire. \n", "test1_true": "Shep FIRES. \nThe enemy pilot grins and FIRES. \nBullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane. \nCary warns Shep they've been hit. \nFrom the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke. \nThe two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of control. \nCary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him. \nFlames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of the red hot controls. \nThe plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward. \nShep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry. \nAbove, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. Francis, though, doesn't look happy. \nShep twists in his seat and looks around. \nCary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit. \nSHEP (o.s.) Level off, Cary! Level off! \nDespite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick. \nFrom the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by. \nThe plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop. \nSmoke. Flames. \nCary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to clamber out. \nCARY Shep! Shep, are you all right? \nSHEP Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it. \nCARY Here, give me your arm! I'll get you out of here! Hang on there, Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella. \nCary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious. \nFlames consume the plane. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA TEMPERATURE CHART for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle continues to RUMBLE. \nANOTHER CHART swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked NORMAL. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on. \nSHEP AND CARY stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches. \nTHE CLOCK slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- Armistice Day. \nSHEP AND CARY sit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye. \nCARY Well, the old guerre is finie. \nSHEP That's right. \nCARY What are ya gonna do now, Shep? \nSHEP Get tight. \nCARY (turns to him) And then what? \nShep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious. \nSHEP Stay tight. \nCary grins wryly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have passed through close behind them. \nTheir distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers. \n", "test1_id": 429, "test2_input": "NIKKI Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like. \nThe whistle BLOWS. Cary panics. \nCARY Hey! He's blowing the whistle. (grabs Shep's shoulder) Hey, we're gonna start. \nSHEP Well, let her start. \nThe trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey. \nBILL Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?! \nFRANCIS Who cares?! \nSHEP Who cares?! \nNIKKI Who cares?! \nFrink enters casually. \nFRINK Hello, everybody. \nCary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others. \nCARY And you, too? \nFRINK That's right. \nThe group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin. \nCARY That's right. Who cares? \nCary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all: \nNIKKI Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to write! \nShep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE TRAIN'S WHEELS racing down the track. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor. \nBILL Hi, men! Look what I found. \nWith a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of \"Hooray!\" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. \nVarious bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger. \nSHEP Come in. \nFRANCIS Sit down. \nCARY Have a drink. \nGENTLEMAN Ah, thank you, no, not I. \nBill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. The basket of turtles hangs from above. \nGENTLEMAN I - I say, are you all going to Portugal? \nSHEP Yup. We're going down there to investigate conditions. \nGENTLEMAN Investigate conditions? \nBILL Drinking conditions, mostly. \nSHEP By the way, what ARE conditions? \nGENTLEMAN Don't you know what conditions are? \nSHEP No. Never saw one in my life. \nBILL The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here. \nGENTLEMAN (chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles) Ahh, indeed. \nBILL My beer's full of cinders. \nCARY Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs. \nThe men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready. \n", "test2_true": "Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway. \nNIKKI I'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed. \nSHEP Going to bed? Who ever heard of such a thing? \nBill rises to confer with her at the door. \nBILL Can we help you undress? \nNIKKI No, thank you, William. \nThe old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange. \nFRANCIS Take off your shoes? \nSHEP Undo your hair? \nBILL Scrub your back or something? \nNIKKI No, I can manage quite well by myself. Good night, everybody. \nThe men say, \"Good night.\" Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory eye, is the most polite: \nFRINK Good night, Nikki. \nNikki turns and disappears down the corridor. The old gentleman mops his brow with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar. \nCARY Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop? She wouldn't let them help her undress. \nGENTLEMAN Can't understand it at all. \nCARY You know, she's not very pretty. But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons. \nGENTLEMAN Indeed? \nCARY She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS speaking out of turn. Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture. \nGENTLEMAN Mm, seems to need a few repairs. \nDuring the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, then notices Francis dozing off. Frink cautiously rises and exits into the corridor without anyone noticing his departure. \nSHEP She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes. \nBILL You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen! You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head! \nSHEP I did SO see an Assyrian Queen. \nCARY In whose green hat? \nSHEP In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat. \nFrancis' pocket watch CHIMES. He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves absently toward the door. Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: \"Whoa!\" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others. \nCARY Hold on there! Where you goin'? \nSHEP You're not going anywhere. You're on a train. \nFRANCIS Sorry. \nSHEP You go back to your turtles, hear? You've been neglecting your assignment. \nFrancis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. Curious, the old gentleman rises to join him. Francis explains as he works: \nFRANCIS I have to sprinkle the turtles, see? \nGENTLEMAN Sprinkle the turtles? \nFRANCIS Sure. \nThe old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding. \nFRANCIS Cool 'em off. \nGENTLEMAN Hm? \nFRANCIS Turtles get feverish on trains. \nGENTLEMAN Ahh! Uh huh. \nA woman's SCREAM drifts in from the corridor. \nNIKKI'S VOICE Cary! \nFRANCIS What's that? \n", "test2_id": 430, "test3_input": "CARY I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight. \nShep, excited, gets out from under the bedcovers. \nSHEP (like a little kid) Bull-fight? Are we going to a bull-fight? \nCARY Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight. \nSHEP Is that guy Frink coming along? \nCARY 'Fraid so. \nSHEP Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy? \nCARY Somebody'll have to shoot him. \nShep rises and walks off. \nSHEP Not a bad idea at that. \nCary watches him go and blows his party horn, wryly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ARENA - DAY A bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull- fight posters that read: CORRIDA DE TOUROS \nA crowd files in under an arched entranceway. Our little group enters, dressed for a day at the fights. \nBILL Praca de Touros! \nAnd, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: PRACA DE TOUROS \nBILL I wonder if there's a bar inside or anything. \nA friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and joins them. \nPEDRO Sure, there IS a bar. \nSHEP Let's find the bar. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight. \nPEDRO Right this way. \nPedro leads and they happily follow. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT. THE BAR - MINUTES LATER Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, extremely drunken old man is the only other customer. \nBILL Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya? Isn't that a beautiful thing? \nCARY What are you all gonna have? \nSHEP Beer is what I want. \nBILL Beer. \nFRINK Beer. \nFRANCIS Beer. \nPEDRO (orders) Cinco cervejas. \nBARTENDER Cinco cervejas. \nNikki and Cary stand together at the bar. \nNIKKI I don't like beer. \nCARY Make you leap like a tuna. \nNIKKI Don't wanna leap like a tuna. \nCARY Make you bark like a fox. \nNIKKI Don't wanna bark like a fox. \nCARY Make you laugh and play. \nNIKKI That's what I wanna do! Laugh and play! \nCARY (to the bartender) Hey! Vermouth! \nBill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose. \nBILL Well, men, fire and fall back! \n", "test3_true": "A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe. \nBill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's foot. \nBILL Hey! What's the idea? \nThe others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused. \nBILL Well, I hope I don't catch a cold in my left ear. \nBand MUSIC plays. Cary looks up, concerned. \nCARY Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss the parade! \nThe group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARENA - MINUTES LATER The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters the ring. \nLed by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row. \nWhen Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, shaking his hand. \nBILL Well! My old pal! \nThe old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting. \nIN THE RING The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the crowd. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout \"Hooray!\" Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki. \nCARY Nikki, here's a present for you. \nNIKKI Oh, a hat! \nPEDRO Oh, se\u00f1or, no, no, no -- you must not keep the hat. You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight. \nCARY What kind of present? \nPEDRO Well, eh - a little jewelry. Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the-- \nCARY Vanilla? \nPEDRO Yes! Vanilla! \nA trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited. \nBILL Look! Here he comes! \nIN THE RING A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each time. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Bill sits next to Pedro. \nPEDRO Nice work! Good work. \nBILL What's so good about it? \nPEDRO He works close to the bull. \nBILL Is that so dangerous? \nPEDRO Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting is very dangerous. It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring. \nBill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query. \nCARY Is it true the bull is blind when he charges? \nPEDRO He sees only the cape -- perhaps. \nIN THE RING Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Bill is unimpressed. \nBILL Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. You know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter. \nPEDRO You should have started at twelve years of old. \nBILL I bet I could start right now. \nCARY (puts a hand on Bill's shoulder) Sit still and behave yourself. \nPEDRO Bull-fighting is not for Americans. \nBILL You think we haven't got the nerve or something? \n", "test3_id": 431}

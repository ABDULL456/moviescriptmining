{"train": "THE LAST FLIGHT \nWritten by \nJohn Monk Saunders \nFADE IN \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT \nOn a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. \nAbruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES appear with every FIRING. \nOn the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose: \nWAR MONTAGE \nNothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of: \nCannon firing in all directions. \nMassive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. \nTroops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water towering into the sky. \nAn entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar fire visible above them on the horizon. \nBrief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling. \nFASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC: \nMortar fire, explosions, smoke. \nA machine gunner fires. \nA soldier falls. \nInfantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze. \nMore machine gunning. \nMore soldiers go down. \nA massive gun fires. \nSMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen. \nInfantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles. \nA bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes. \nA bomb drops from an airplane. \nAerial view of an exploding building. \nAnti-aircraft guns at work. \nPlanes in the air. \nA machine gun fires skyward. \nPlanes circle, filling the air. \nA single bi-plane. \nThe plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks into a grin. \nShep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see: \nAnother plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them. \nAn enemy plane arrives. \nThe enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns. \nBill and Francis' plane spins away. \nBill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to Francis' amusement. \nThe planes circle in the air. \nThe enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail as Cary watches. \nThe enemy pilot returns fire. \nDOCTOR Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. (rises, joins them) You two leaving us, eh? In a way, I'm sorry to release you two. I have no choice in the matter. \nShep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye. \nSHEP What am I going to do, Major, about my-- oh, this rotten business? \nThe doctor examines Shep's eye more closely. \nDOCTOR Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Lieutenant? \nSHEP Mm hm. \nDOCTOR What the French call a tic. T-I-C, tic. Little bothersome, isn't it? \nShep puts his glasses back on. \nSHEP Yes, sir. \nDOCTOR I'm afraid time'll have to take care of that. Time and normal living. \nShep's lips tighten skeptically. \nDOCTOR You two are returning to the United States, I presume? \nShep glances at Cary. \nCARY Ah, we haven't decided. \nDOCTOR I'd take the first boat home. Well, here you go. \nThe doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him. \nDOCTOR Oh, I forgot your burnt hands. \nThe doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket. \nDOCTOR Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch them and loosen them up. In time, you'll regain their full use. \nCARY Thank you, sir. \nThe doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder. \nDOCTOR Bye, Lieutenant. \nCary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor. \nDOCTOR Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck. \nShep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide. \nDOCTOR Well, there they go. Out to face life. (shakes his head) And their whole training was in preparation for death. \nHe moves off as we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and head into the hospital. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary. \nAIDE Why can't they go on with flying? You know, the air mails or something? \nDOCTOR I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction. \nThe aide looks at him, quizzically. \nDOCTOR They fell, you know -- six thousand meters. (shakes his head, sadly) Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement. Shattered both of them. Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle. \nAIDE Spent bullets. \nDOCTOR Spent bullets. That's it. (nods) They're like projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy. (gestures with cigarette) They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory. And now they've fallen back to earth. Spent. Cooled off. Useless. \nWe slowly PULL BACK from the two men. \nAIDE Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right. \nDOCTOR Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they? What can you expect of them? (shakes his head) I hate to think what may become of them. \nWe have pulled back far enough and now we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTER Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs and wave. \nNIKKI Teeth. \nCARY Teeth? \nAfter another look, Cary turns to his friends. \nCARY Hey, it's teeth! \nBILL (o.s.) Teeth?! \nShep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in amazement at the teeth. Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention. \nSHEP Teeth! \nNIKKI That's right. \nBILL (enthusiastic) Yup. It's a full set -- upper and lower. \nCARY (to Nikki) It's a nice expression. \nSHEP Hey, how come you're with those teeth? \nNIKKI I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute. \nCARY Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for? \nNIKKI Said he wanted to biff somebody. \nBILL (excited) Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?! \nNIKKI Just around to the right. \nBILL Come on, men! We're liable to see a fight. \nAs quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance. \nCARY Would you like to come along? \nNIKKI (as if it were obvious) Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind the man's teeth. \nThey glance down at the teeth. \nCARY Oh, of course. \nCary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling. \nFLASH CUT - A MAN'S FACE as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists. \nFLASH CUT - THE MAN'S BODY dropping unconscious to the floor. \nOUR FOUR HEROES enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and haul away the unconscious body. Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself: \nBILL Well. THAT'S all fixed. \nBill straightens his bow-tie. Already the group seeks a new distraction. \nCARY Let's go back. \nThey head back to the bar. \nTHE BAR Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of searching, Cary spots her at the bar. \nCARY Oh, there she is. \nAll four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company. \nBILL Well, we missed it. \nNIKKI Did something happen? \nBILL Well, they carried a guy out. (sees her empty glass) Say! What's become of the teeth? \nNIKKI Oh, the man came and got his teeth. \nCARY Well, what did he say? \nNIKKI He said thank you for holding his teeth. \nCARY What did he look like? \nNIKKI I think he fell in an airplane in the war -- and got his teeth knocked out. \nCARY Well, why do you think he was in the war? \nNIKKI Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole. \nBILL (with a wave, to Frink) Thank you. \nA waiter joins them as they settle in. \nSHEP Hello, Cary. \nCARY Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have to drink? \nFRANCIS Martini! \nBILL Martini! \nSHEP Martini! \nFRINK Martini! \nWAITER Quatre Martinis? \nNIKKI Uh, could I have champagne, please? \nWAITER Champagne? Oui. \nThe waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look. \nBILL Boys, she's goin' to be a problem. \nNIKKI (explains, to Bill) That's what I started on. (to Cary) It upsets me if I change over to anything else. \nCARY (to Bill) There's a lot of things wrong with this one. (to Nikki) What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway? \nSHEP Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there? \nFRANCIS There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back. \nNIKKI Can't read signs. \nSHEP Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all. \nBILL Do you think she's good-lookin' enough? \nNIKKI Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but-- \nCARY But what? \nNIKKI But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon. \nShep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying to start a fire. \nBILL Then there's her drinking. \nNIKKI What's the matter with my drinking? \nBILL You're a sissy drinker. \nNIKKI Well, maybe I can improve. \nMeanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth. \nBILL Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 'em is turned sideways. \nNIKKI (points) You mean this one? \nBILL That's it. \nCARY Why don't you have it turned around? \nNIKKI I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help. \nCARY Well, in what respect does it kind of help? \nNIKKI Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don't let anyone kiss me -- hard. \nThe men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne. \nCARY Well, we'll let that pass. \nBill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room. \nNIKKI Where's he gone? \nCARY Shep went off to sharpen his skates. \nBILL Now, about your nose. \nNIKKI What about my nose? \nShe nods. Shep is amused. \nSHEP Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse. \nBILL (with a dismissive wave) All right, all right, I'll tackle a horse. \nShep looks down the street. \nSHEP Here comes one now. \nThey all look to see: \nA HORSE-DRAWN CAB rolling down the street in their direction. \nAT THE TABLE Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab. \nBILL Look out, horse! \nTHE HORSE-DRAWN CAB rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature. \nON THE SIDEWALK Cary, horrified, stands and yells: \nCARY Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here! \nCary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement. \nNIKKI (distraught) Oh, Bill! \nAT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins. \nCARY Hey! What's the idea -- runnin' down my friend like that? Here! \nCary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in French but takes the cash. \nWIDER VIEW of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver. \nCARY Never mind. Look where you're going in the future now. You just watch out where you're going! \nANOTHER VIEW Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him. \nCARY (admonishes Bill) Now listen, come on out here, you old fool. (to the shying horse) Whoa, whoa. \nBILL Nice horsie. \nCARY (to Bill) Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You old fool! You know what you'll do? You'll kill yourself one of these days. Now, come on, get out of here. Now, listen-- \nSatisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk. \nCARY (to the driver) You all right now, brother? \nThe driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse. \nCARY All right. Now, you just keep your horse, see? You got your money. \nThe cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse. \nBACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his seat. They all sit down under the following: \nCARY Hey, listen, Bill, you're All- American, see? You're TWO All- Americans! The lady's convinced you're the whole team. You don't have to tackle any more horses. How 'bout that? Drink your drink. \nBILL (pleased with himself) Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill? \nNikki abruptly rises. \nSHEP Hey! Where are you going? \nNIKKI Would you all excuse me for a moment? \nCARY Well, where are you going? \nNIKKI (a grave announcement) To take a Chinese singing lesson. \nFrancis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an olive in the air and cheers: \nFRANCIS Hooray! \nThe men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs: \nMEN Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! \nNIKKI walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room. \nBACK AT THE TABLE Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile. \nBILL Hey. What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is? \nCARY Said his aunt had on a very low-neck dress. \nFRANCIS Can't believe it. \nBILL And she sat right across the table in front of me. And I said, \"Auntie -- I can see your knees!\" \nNobody laughs or even changes expression. \nCARY (pointedly, after an awkward pause) I wonder what's doing in Portugal tonight. \nBill is disappointed at the response. \nBILL Maybe I'd better do my match trick. \nNIKKI If you do match tricks, I'll recite. \nCARY Recite what? \nNIKKI Poetry. \nCARY Whose poetry? \nNIKKI My poetry. \nCARY You write poetry? \nNIKKI I'll send you a photograph of my poetry. \nCary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and Nikki. He gestures at the bottle as he sits back down. \nCARY Say, I wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that. \nEverybody cracks up -- except Nikki, who looks a little hurt. \nAn empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT By now, a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the floor. \nCLOSE SHOT - FRINK'S HAND strays to Nikki's legs and up her dress. \nWIDER Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink. \nNIKKI Just what ARE your plans? \nWIDER STILL The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and stare darkly at Frink. \nSHEP You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki. He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good time. \nFrink nervously adjusts his necktie. Cary glares at him. \nCARY Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy. Have I made myself clear? \nFrink, pretending chagrin, looks at Nikki. \nFRINK All right. My mistake. I'm sorry. \nCARY You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He's just a licentious old man. \nNIKKI It's getting pretty late, isn't it? \nCARY Do you want to go home, Nikki? (rises) I'll take you home. Where do you live? \nNIKKI Hotel Carlton. \nThe others, except for Frink, begin to rise, too. Shep pays the waiter. \nBILL I'll take her home, too. \nFRANCIS So will I! \nSHEP We'll match to see who takes her home! \nBILL Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her home. \nCARY I saw her first. \nBILL It makes no difference. She belongs to us all now! \nNikki laughs as they all depart. Frink rises wearily to follow them out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL CARLTON - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says, \"Wheeee!\" Others say, \"Ssshhh!\" They cross to the front desk. \nThe car starts up the shaft again. \nNIKKI Hurray! \nSHEP & FRANCIS Hurray! \nCARY There we are. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - FIFTH FLOOR - MINUTES LATER - LONG TRAVELING SHOT The elevator door opens. Cary leads the way as everyone else spills out happily into the hall. Shep puts a congratulatory arm around Cary. \nSHEP Say! That's a pilot for ya. \nBILL You deserve a medal. \nBill pins Nikki's room key to Cary's vest pocket. Smiling, Cary holds it up proudly to Nikki. \nBILL All right, come on, men. \nThey head down the hallway in a drunken, disorganized fashion. Shep walks an imaginary tightrope, wobbling spectacularly. Cary, bringing up the rear, shuts the elevator door and escorts Nikki. \nFRANCIS I need a rest, I need a rest. \nFrancis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but Bill immediately hauls him up: \nBILL Come on, come on. \nBill, whistling and pretending to ice skate, leads the group down the hall. Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway. Bill backtracks to help Frink escort Francis. This allows Cary and Nikki to take the lead. Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary. \nNIKKI Right here. \nCARY Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are! \nThe group cheers. Cary unlocks the door. The group enters Nikki's hotel room. \nINT. NIKKI'S HOTEL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Laughing, the group files into the darkened room and spreads out. \nSHEP Wheeeee! \nNikki switches on the lights. Bill marvels at the luxurious suite. \nBILL Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--! Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment! \nSHEP And a gramophone! \nDelighted, Shep starts to crank up the gramophone. \nCARY (unimpressed) Yeah! And chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything. \nFRANCIS So THIS is where Nikki lives! \nAmused and pleased by their reaction, Nikki heads for her bedroom. \nNIKKI Yes, this is where Nikki lives. \nShep picks up a book and admires it grandly. \nSHEP And she's got a book! \nThe gramophone comes to life and MUSIC plays from a record. Nikki passes into the bedroom and switches on a light. \nFRANCIS Got all the comforts of home. \nFrink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill pointedly intercepts him. Disappointed, Frink looks past him into Nikki's bedroom and Bill follows his gaze to see: \nPERFUME BOTTLES on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them. \nBILL Hey! Look at all the bottles! \nBill enters and inspects the table closely. \nNIKKI'S BEDROOM as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter. \nBILL Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's bottles! \nCary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and reads the label. \nBILL Ylang! Ylang! \nCARY Hey, don't be handlin' her things. Put 'em down. \nBut Bill goes right on, delighted. The others crowd around the table. \nBILL Chichi! \nSHEP Awww! Bed? \nThey rise reluctantly. Bill shakes water off his hand. \nBILL Yup, all right. \nThey file out of the bathroom. \nSHEP (waves to the turtles) So long, turtles. \nBILL Good night, turtles. \nFRANCIS Night, turtles. \nFrink follows the others humorlessly, without a word to the turtles. \nTRACKING SHOT - THROUGH THE SUITE The entire group exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into the sitting room. \nBILL Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to sleep? \nNIKKI (nods) Mm hm. \nSHEP Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep! \nBILL (with a wave, to Nikki) Well, good night. \nAs Bill enters the sitting room, he looks around and hurries away toward something he sees off screen. Shep and Francis follow. \nSHEP (with a wave) Nighty-night, Nikki. \nFrancis says nothing. \nFRINK Good night, Nikki. \nFrink is the last out the bedroom door, though Cary stays behind to linger a moment with Nikki. \nSITTING ROOM Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep. \nBILL (satisfied) Ah! \nShep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him. Frink watches Francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it. \nAT THE BEDROOM DOOR Nikki and Cary stand close, exchanging warm goodnights. \nNIKKI (dead serious) Good night, Cary. \nCARY (playful) Good night, Nikki. \nCary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into the bedroom and shut the door. He turns from the door to see: \nLOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM Four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: Bill and Shep on the sofa, Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table. Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and yawning as only a narcoleptic can. \nBILL Say! I like this place. \nFRANCIS Say, I like this place, too. \nSHEP I think it's swell. \nCARY peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips. \nFRINK (o.s.) It suits me. \nCARY You fellas think you're gonna PARK here? \nBILL (o.s.) Sure! \nFRANCIS (o.s.) Sure. \nCary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see: \nNIKKI opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some towels. \nNIKKI (innocently) Will somebody please scrub my back? \nLOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM Excited again, Bill jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process. \nBILL Will somebody scrub your back?! Look out, boys! \nThe men struggle to their feet and follow him to: \nNIKKI holds the bottle in her hand. The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker than the others and commandeers it with authority. \nBILL I got it, I got it, I got it. \nFrom over Nikki's nearly bare back, we watch Bill whistling jauntily as he shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel. \nFRANCIS Morning. \nBILL Um, prairie oyster. \nSHEP Prairie oyster. \nShep has to nudge Francis with an elbow. \nFRANCIS Prairie oyster. \nBARTENDER Prairie oyster for three. \nBartender moves off. Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses. \nCARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men: \nSHEP Say, we'd better get back to our hotel. \nFRANCIS There's no Nikki at our hotel. \nBILL That's right. \nSHEP And the bar doesn't open so early. \nBILL Say! Why don't we move in here? \nFRANCIS Sure. Let's stay here. \nBILL But - what about Cary? \nFRANCIS (to Shep) What about Cary? \nSHEP (to Francis) What ABOUT Cary? \nFrancis shakes his head, he has no idea. \nBILL We can move him in, too. \nFrancis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive. \nSHEP Not a bad idea! \nShep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled \"thank you.\" The three men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the others out, their hangovers apparently remedied. \nBILL (cheerfully) Well, come on, men. Let's go. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nINT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATER THAT DAY Phonograph music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel's specialist in Chinois Pedicure, paints Nikki's toenails. We PAN UP to discover Nikki wearing a robe, sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the door. \nNIKKI (wearily) Entrez! \nTHE FRONT DOOR opens and Bill, looking dapper, enters. \nBILL Hi, Nik! \nThen, Shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of flowers. \nSHEP Hello, Nikki! \nNext, Francis enters, sleepily. \nFRANCIS (in mid-yawn) Hello. \nFinally, Cary, who closes the door behind him. \nCARY Good morning, Nikki. \nThe men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober. Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot in the room. He lies down and shuts his eyes. \nNIKKI (o.s.) Hello, Bill. Hello, Shep. Hello, Cary. Hello, Francis. \nFRANCIS (from the sofa) Morning, Nikki. \nNIKKI I didn't expect to see you all so early. \nShep puts the flowers in a vase. \nBILL We camped on your doorsteps last night. And this morning we all moved in. \nCary leans over her affectionately. \nCARY Despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you. We've decided to adopt you. \nFRINK I-- Well-- \nDuring the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, bring them over, and offer one to Frink. \nBILL Have a drink? \nFRINK No, thanks. \nSHEP Cure the shakes. \nFRINK I haven't got the shakes. \nCARY Let's see. Hold out your hands. \nBill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up. \nCARY No, turn them over. \nFrink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, impressed. \nCARY Say, that's pretty good. \nCary looks down at the drink in his own hand. \nCARY Let's see if you can hold this. \nCary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full glass with ease. \nCARY Say, that's great. \nCary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration. \nCARY Steady as a rock! \nFrink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his hands and no way to safely remove them. \nCary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her. \nCARY Well, I guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while. \nFrink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others. \nFRINK Hey. Take these off. \nBut the others simply ignore him. \nCARY Now, let's see. Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted? \nBILL We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. \nCARY That's right. We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, too. \nThe Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises. \nWOMAN Finis. \nThe men cheer, \"Yay!\" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs. \nSHEP Let's inspect the job. \nBut Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand. \nNIKKI Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too close. \nNikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it. \nCARY Well, what's the matter with your toes? \nNikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness. \nNIKKI Well... when I was a little girl... \nA worried look crosses Cary's face. \nNIKKI ... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... And they were WAY too short. ... \nShep and Bill listen soberly. \nNIKKI ... And I had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back. ... Down the road. ... And it was hot and dusty. \nBILL (hand to his face) Oh, take her away! She's breakin' my heart! (sobs) \nNIKKI And when I got home ...  my toes were spoiled. \nCARY (on the verge of tears) Oh, dear, oh, dear. \nNIKKI Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you. \nWithout waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look down at her shoes. \nNIKKI Oooh! (to Cary) Ooh, wait for Nikki! \nShe leaves him and runs back to: \nTHE FRONT DOOR of her suite where Shep still stands. He watches with surprise as Nikki runs in. \nNIKKI (calls back to Cary) Wait for Nikki! \nPuzzled, Shep follows Nikki who rushes to: \nHER BEDROOM CLOSET Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and shoes. Shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly identical pair of red ones. \nSHEP What are you changing your shoes for? \nNIKKI On account of I can walk faster in red shoes. \nShep watches her hop and scurry off. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. AVENUE CASIMIR-PERIER - LATER THAT DAY Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk caf\u00e9 -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver (\"Restez ici.\"), looks at the rain. \nCARY (to Nikki) Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up. \nNIKKI Could we sit down here, do you suppose? \nCARY I think so. Would you like something to drink? \nThey move toward the caf\u00e9. As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives. \nNIKKI What should I drink now, do you suppose? \nCary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table. \nCARY (to the waiter) Deux picon citrons. \nThe waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following: \nNIKKI Picon citrons? \nCARY Very refreshing. Make you laugh and play. \nNIKKI (amused) That's what you always promise. (suddenly serious) Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately? \nCARY Don't we all? \nNIKKI Not like Shep. \nCARY Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet. \nNIKKI But isn't there some kind of treatment or something? \nCARY Shep could never stand a long course of treatment. Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. So he stays tight. \nThe waiter arrives with the drinks. As he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki. The waiter leaves and they drink. \nNIKKI Seems such a pity. How did he get the tic? \nCARY In the war. \nNIKKI I know. But how? \nCARY Well, it's not very romantic. \nNIKKI Well, don't tell me if you don't want to. \nCARY Well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit. \nNIKKI Yes? \nCARY Lice under his bandages. \nNIKKI Oh. \nCARY He had the devil of a time. He nearly lost his mind. So you'll have to excuse him a little. \nNIKKI I'm so sorry for Shep. \nCARY Well, don't let him know it. \nCARY Whatever that is. He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called H\u00e9lo\u00efse. And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of-- Well, betrayal. Not, however, unmixed with real love. He carried her off to Brittany. \nNIKKI Tell me more. \nCARY Well, her uncle was furious. He blamed Ab\u00e9lard for the whole thing. He conceived a terrible revenge. \nNIKKI (uneasy) I'm afraid for Ab\u00e9lard. \nCARY He broke into Ab\u00e9lard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment. \nNIKKI Oh, dear. \nCARY The lovers were forced to live their lives apart. But when they died, they were buried here side by side. (peers down at the ground) There's a story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb. \nNIKKI Heart-shaped stones? \nCARY And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other. (looks at Nikki) And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Ab\u00e9lard, no harm can come to your true love. \nNIKKI How perfectly beautiful. \nCARY Isn't that a quaint legend? \nThey crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off their gloves under the following: \nNIKKI Do you think I might find a heart- shaped stone? You help me, Cary. \nCARY All right, Nikki. Only we have to leave soon. (looks off) They close up the place. \nNIKKI Just as soon as we find our stones. \nThey reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the tomb. After a moment, Nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her hand. \nNIKKI I found one! Where's yours? \nCary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her. \nNIKKI AND CARY'S HANDS as the couple sits near the tomb. They show each other the stones in their upturned hands. Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it in Cary's stiff, weathered hand. Then she transfers his stone to her hand. \nNIKKI And, now, you take mine. And I'll take yours. \nThey close their hands over the stones as we PULL BACK to a WIDER VIEW of Nikki and Cary smiling at one another. \nNIKKI Isn't that the way the story goes? \nCARY That's right, Nikki. \nNIKKI And, now, no harm can come to our true love. \nCARY (amused) And, now, we'll have to go. \nHe starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm. \nNIKKI You were so nice to let me come with you. I spoiled your whole day. You were going to do something else, weren't you? \nCARY (looks away) Doesn't matter. \nNIKKI Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you come here today? \nCARY (not looking at her) To pay my respects to an old comrade. \nNIKKI Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. (begins to weep softly) Don't pay any attention to me, Cary. I can't help it. You MAKE me cry. \nHe stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on. \nNIKKI Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary. I'm all right. I just want to cry for a minute. (puts a hand on his shoulder) On account of you're so nice. You're so clean, Cary. And your teeth are so white. You're so civilized. You don't care about anything any more, nor anybody. Nothing makes any difference to you. Nothing can touch you. (realizes) Why, you're lost. You're ALL lost. You and Shep and the rest of you. (takes his hand) Oh, I want to do something for you. I want to help you. (looks at his wrist) Let me wash your bracelet, Cary. (points) Why, see? The silver's all tarnished. The silver's all tarnished. (removes his bracelet) I'll take it with me and scrub it when I get home. I'll polish it with my nail-brush. \nNikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse. Thoroughly unnerved by this emotional outburst, Cary looks around. \nCARY It's getting dark. \nCary rises, deeply uncomfortable. Nikki tries to make amends. \nNIKKI Well ... (rises, cheerily) Anyway, we found a name for my turtles! \nCary turns and looks at her, amazed. \nCARY H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Ab\u00e9lard? A name for your turtles? So that's what you were looking for. I might have known how it would end. \nHe looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. His thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. NIKKI'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT Nikki sits, soberly polishing Cary's bracelet with her nail brush. Shep enters, drink in hand. \nSHEP Hi, Nik. \nNIKKI If Cary's going to Portugal, why can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't we got any rights? \nBILL Sure we got rights! \nGetting organized for their own impromptu Portuguese expedition, Bill, Francis and Shep fill the trunk with Nikki's things as Frink leans on it, smoking a cigarette and eyeing Nikki coolly. \nSHEP Cary better not think he can screw up in Portugal and leave old Shep behind. \nFRINK Say, when's he leaving? \nSHEP Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud Express. \nNIKKI Don't we have to have passports and things? \nSHEP Sure we gotta have passports! \nBill joins Nikki. \nBILL What kind passports you like? \nNIKKI What kind passports you got? \nBILL We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry passports. \nNIKKI (grandly) I'll take vanilla. \nShe brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by Frink. \nFRINK Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on the train. \nNIKKI You're goin', too? \nFRINK Why not? (with a sly smile) I might, uh, pick up a couple of features for my paper - in Portugal. \nFrink walks out the door. Nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with carrying items the trunk. Shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the group crowds together. Chaotic overlapping dialogue: \nSHEP Nikki, do you want --? \nNIKKI Did you put all my shoes in? \nBILL You bet. There they are-- \nSHEP I don't know how you're going to get all these dresses in, Nikki. \nFrom the trunk, we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. NIKKI'S SUITE - NEXT MORNING A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor. \nNIKKI Don't we have to go like anything? The train leaves in twenty minutes. \nFrancis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki: \nBILL Are you SURE you have everything? \nNIKKI (misses the irony) I - I think so. \nFrancis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile. \nFRANCIS (dryly) Hardly seems enough. \nSuddenly, Nikki gasps and rises. \nNIKKI Oh, my turtles! My turtles! \nTHE TURTLES are plucked from the tub and placed in ... \n... A BASKET by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis. \nBILL Here you are, Francis! You're the custodian of the turtles! Now don't fall down on the job. \nBill walks off. Francis calls after him, worried: \nFRANCIS Hey! I never tended turtles before. \nNikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand. \nNIKKI Now, all you have to do - \nShe gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet hand. \nNIKKI - is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this. \nFRANCIS Oh, yeah. I see. \nNIKKI Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like. \nThe whistle BLOWS. Cary panics. \nCARY Hey! He's blowing the whistle. (grabs Shep's shoulder) Hey, we're gonna start. \nSHEP Well, let her start. \nThe trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey. \nBILL Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?! \nFRANCIS Who cares?! \nSHEP Who cares?! \nNIKKI Who cares?! \nFrink enters casually. \nFRINK Hello, everybody. \nCary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others. \nCARY And you, too? \nFRINK That's right. \nThe group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin. \nCARY That's right. Who cares? \nCary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all: \nNIKKI Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to write! \nShep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE TRAIN'S WHEELS racing down the track. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor. \nBILL Hi, men! Look what I found. \nWith a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of \"Hooray!\" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. \nVarious bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger. \nSHEP Come in. \nFRANCIS Sit down. \nCARY Have a drink. \nGENTLEMAN Ah, thank you, no, not I. \nBill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. The basket of turtles hangs from above. \nGENTLEMAN I - I say, are you all going to Portugal? \nSHEP Yup. We're going down there to investigate conditions. \nGENTLEMAN Investigate conditions? \nBILL Drinking conditions, mostly. \nSHEP By the way, what ARE conditions? \nGENTLEMAN Don't you know what conditions are? \nSHEP No. Never saw one in my life. \nBILL The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here. \nGENTLEMAN (chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles) Ahh, indeed. \nBILL My beer's full of cinders. \nCARY Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs. \nThe men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready. \nGENTLEMAN Hm? \nThe men hear Nikki SCREAMING. \nCARY Nikki! \nFrancis, Cary, Bill and Shep -- in that order -- scramble out the door, leaving the old gentleman behind. \nNIKKI'S VOICE Cary! Bill! Shep! \nThe men rush down the corridor to: \nINT. NIKKI'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER Frink grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she struggles to free herself from his grasp. \nNIKKI Cary! \nEnergized by Nikki's peril, Francis bursts in and pulls Frink away from her. \nFRANCIS Say! \nNikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers herself as Frink pushes Francis hard into a nearby wall, knocking him to the floor. \nFRINK Get out of here! \nFrink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees a dazed Francis slumped against the wall, clutching his head. Cary grabs Frink's shoulder and spins him around. \nCARY Say, what's the idea? \nFRINK What's the idea? Well, what business is that of yours? \nBy now, Bill and Shep have entered and joined the tense confrontation. \nCARY Nikki, you all right? What is this tough trying to do to you anyway? \nNIKKI Well, I was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me. \nCARY Frink, you'd better get out of here right away before something happens to you. \nFRINK What right have you to tell me to get out of here? This isn't your compartment, is it? \nCARY Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it. If you don't clear out of here right now, you're liable to get hurt. \nFRINK All right. Suppose you put me out. \nBILL (savagely) Put him out? I'll snap his spine and throw him off the train! \nCary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds Bill back. \nCARY Hold everything, Bill! \nDistraught, Nikki sinks down on a chair. \nNIKKI Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like this? \nFrink turns to her in protest. \nFRINK I'm not gonna let these silly drunks tell ME where to get off. \nSHEP Silly drunks?! \nCARY Silly drunks, did you say? \nFRINK Yes. And that goes for the whole bunch of you. \nBILL Let me have him. \nCARY (to Bill) Wait a minute. I'll take care of him. \nFRINK You will, eh? \nFrink starts to strong-arm Cary. Cary punches Frink in the jaw, knocking him onto the bed. \nSHEP Socko! \nAs Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed, half-conscious, Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head. \nNIKKI Oh, dear! \nCary, fist still tightly clenched, stands over the dazed Frink as Bill brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight. \nBILL Mm! Now, ain't that nice? Have you ever seen anything so cute? \nFrancis exits uncertainly. \nCARY Will you be all right now, Nikki? \nPEDRO Why, listen, bull-fighting is just for us, the Latins. \nBILL He thinks we're a-scared! \nNIKKI (helpfully) He tackled a horse once. \nPEDRO (stares at Bill) Tackle a horse? \nFull of himself, Bill nods. \nPEDRO (turns away; flatly) Is not the same! \nEveryone suddenly stares in shock as: \nIN THE RING the bull knocks down the matador. Others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild, out of control. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep. \nWILD BULL MONTAGE The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate. \nThe crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the matador's cap that Cary had caught. \nToreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden barrier that circles the inside of the arena. \nBill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below him. \nBILL Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe! \nThe toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask \"If it's so easy, why don't you try it?\" The other toreros laugh. \nBill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the railing. \nHe jumps down into the ring. \nCARY'S VOICE Hey! \nCary rises, stunned. \nCARY Bill! Come back here! \nBut it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as he stalks after the bull. \nThe bull turns and sees him. \nBill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman. \nShep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away. \nThe bull begins to charge. \nCary climbs over the railing. \nThe bull charges. \nTRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin. \nThe bull is on him. The bull roars. \nBill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. \nThe bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain. \nCUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd. \nFour toreros rush in. \nThey surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless. \nCary runs across the ring. \nMore toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away. \nIn the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as \n... toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body. Cary joins them. \nCARY Bill! \nBut Bill is unconscious. A torero says something to Cary in Portuguese. Cary and the others lift Bill. \nCARY Take it easy! Take it easy! \nThey carry Bill off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT The amusement park at Port Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with appropriate MUSIC. \nAt a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down. Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their drinks. They hear: \nGUNSHOTS. \nThey look over to see: \nA little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various colorful targets and win prizes. \nCARY Sounds like old times. \nSHEP Let's go and shoot. \nCARY Not a bad idea. (to Nikki) What say, Annie Oakley? Like to fire off a gun at something? \nNIKKI No objection. \nSHEP (to their bartender) We'll be right back. Hold everything. \nThe group starts over to: \nTHE SHOOTING GALLERY where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons. \nSHEP First one to miss pays for the drinks. \nCARY What'll we shoot at? \nNIKKI Shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens. \nSHEP All right. Look out, pussycat. \nShep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe behind them. \nShep's eyes pop with surprise. \nSHEP Well, that's what I was aiming at, a clay pipe. (stares in amazement) Whole thing's been misrepresented to me. \nCary laughs at him. \nNIKKI Cary, let's see you shoot something. \nCary takes careful aim. \nCARY Look out, ball! \nHe FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water. \nNIKKI What'd YOU aim at? \nCARY Well, let's see you shoot something. \nNikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of- view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be handling a gun. Cary moves to help her. \nCARY Oh, no, no, no, Nikki. \nNIKKI How do you hold it still? \nCARY Listen, Nikki, on your right shoulder. Now, put your hand out there and hold up-- No, don't cover up the site. No, no, no, that's right. Now just hold it evenly-- \nRapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole row of pipes with split-second firing. \nThe others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to encourage Nikki. \nCARY You can do better than that. Show him up. \nShe again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks up a pistol and imitates her. \nFRINK What are you waving at, Nikki? \nCary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing Frink's wrist with both hands. \nCARY (angry) Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you know better than that? \nShep and Francis move to shield Nikki. \nFRINK What's the idea? \nCARY Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki? \nFRINK Take your hands off me. \nCARY Put down that gun! \nFRINK Let go of my wrist! \n", "test1_input": "SHEP Yes! That's why he can't hold a glass. \nNIKKI Oh, I'm so ashamed. \nSHEP Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. His nerves are tricky. You should never call attention to his hands. \nAT A TABLE Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable FRINK -- enters and greets him casually. \nFRINK Hi, Cary. \nCARY (unhappily) Oh, hello, Frink. \nCary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for Francis and Bill. \nFRINK Hello, Francis. Bill. \nFrink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused. \nFRINK Shep. Drunk again? \nSHEP Say, don't you know any OTHER opening remarks? It's about all we've heard from you for a year. \nFRINK (signals the bartender) Hi! Jean! \nFrink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for Frink's order in French. \nFRINK Un sidecar. \nJEAN Sidecar ... [?] \nJean moves off. Frink regards the others. \nFRINK Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work? \nSHEP Work? What kind of work? \nFRINK Oh, anything useful. \nBILL What could we do? Sell washing machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend old furniture or somethin'? Heh! \nFRINK Go back to flying. Fly the air mails. \nBILL Aw, we couldn't fly a kite. \nFRANCIS Maybe a small kite. \nFrancis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles. \nFRINK Well, there must be something you can do. \nSHEP We've got to tend to our drinking. We don't get much opportunity. \nFRINK Lots of things going on outside. Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around. \nBILL Say! Is that STILL going on? \nSHEP (laughs) Sounds pretty pre-war to me. \nDuring all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and whispers to Shep. \nFRINK Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? Who's your swell friend? \nSHEP Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found scattered around. \nAround her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth: \nSHEP (off Frink) Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes away. \nNikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. She raises her lorgnette for a better look at: \nCARY who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap. \nNIKKI is pleased to see Cary. \nNIKKI Oh! He didn't go. \nShe rises to join him. \nCARY startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches. \nNIKKI Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands... \nShe tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets. \nNIKKI Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor hands. \n", "test1_true": "NIKKI Oh! \nBut Shep intercepts her. Upset, she whimpers. \nSHEP (more in disbelief than anger) If you aren't the WORST! First, you insult his hands and make him mad. Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious. Come on back here. Come on. \nHe clasps her hand and leads her to: \nTHE BAR Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained face. \nSHEP Well, that's torn it. He'll never come back now. \nNIKKI Then we'll have to find him. \nSHEP What for? \nNIKKI To explain how sorry I am. \nSHEP (amused at her distress) We-ell. You don't have to get so emotional about it. \nNIKKI Who's getting emotional? \nSHEP You are. You're coming all apart. (hands her a glass) Here. Take a drink of this. Make you laugh and play. \nNikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. Meanwhile, Bill leans in. \nBILL (to Shep) Say, what's she crying about? \nSHEP She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning. \nBILL (to Nikki) Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now. \nNIKKI (agrees, sadly) No. \nANOTHER VIEW Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki. \nSHEP Let's go. \nNikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, toward the exit. Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go. Bill calls after Shep: \nBILL Hey! Where're you goin'?! \nSHEP Oh, out. \nBILL (rises) Out where?! \nSHEP (o.s.) Out to get a drink. \nBill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles. \nBILL Don't you suppose you could arrange that here?! \nSHEP Nope. We gotta go somewheres else. \nBILL (without missing a beat) Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go somewheres else to get a drink. \nFrancis and Bill head out the door. After a moment, Frink follows behind. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. AVENUE DES CHAMPS \u00c9LYS\u00c9ES - LATER THAT NIGHT A taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk table. \nBILL Hey! There he is! \nThe others look. \nSHEP Where? \nBILL Come on! \nThe group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for: \nTHE SIDEWALK TABLE where Cary sits reading a newspaper. \nSHEP (o.s.) Cary! \nCary looks up. He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. The others crowd around him. \nBILL Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us? \nCARY (genuinely polite) Hello. Won't you sit down? \nBILL Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think we'd do? Stand around? \nThey all take seats around the little table. During this, Frink brings a chair for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own. When he tries to use it to sit next to her, Bill commandeers it for himself. \n", "test1_id": 429, "test2_input": "CARY I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight. \nShep, excited, gets out from under the bedcovers. \nSHEP (like a little kid) Bull-fight? Are we going to a bull-fight? \nCARY Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight. \nSHEP Is that guy Frink coming along? \nCARY 'Fraid so. \nSHEP Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy? \nCARY Somebody'll have to shoot him. \nShep rises and walks off. \nSHEP Not a bad idea at that. \nCary watches him go and blows his party horn, wryly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ARENA - DAY A bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull- fight posters that read: CORRIDA DE TOUROS \nA crowd files in under an arched entranceway. Our little group enters, dressed for a day at the fights. \nBILL Praca de Touros! \nAnd, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: PRACA DE TOUROS \nBILL I wonder if there's a bar inside or anything. \nA friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and joins them. \nPEDRO Sure, there IS a bar. \nSHEP Let's find the bar. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight. \nPEDRO Right this way. \nPedro leads and they happily follow. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT. THE BAR - MINUTES LATER Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, extremely drunken old man is the only other customer. \nBILL Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya? Isn't that a beautiful thing? \nCARY What are you all gonna have? \nSHEP Beer is what I want. \nBILL Beer. \nFRINK Beer. \nFRANCIS Beer. \nPEDRO (orders) Cinco cervejas. \nBARTENDER Cinco cervejas. \nNikki and Cary stand together at the bar. \nNIKKI I don't like beer. \nCARY Make you leap like a tuna. \nNIKKI Don't wanna leap like a tuna. \nCARY Make you bark like a fox. \nNIKKI Don't wanna bark like a fox. \nCARY Make you laugh and play. \nNIKKI That's what I wanna do! Laugh and play! \nCARY (to the bartender) Hey! Vermouth! \nBill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose. \nBILL Well, men, fire and fall back! \n", "test2_true": "A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe. \nBill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's foot. \nBILL Hey! What's the idea? \nThe others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused. \nBILL Well, I hope I don't catch a cold in my left ear. \nBand MUSIC plays. Cary looks up, concerned. \nCARY Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss the parade! \nThe group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARENA - MINUTES LATER The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters the ring. \nLed by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row. \nWhen Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, shaking his hand. \nBILL Well! My old pal! \nThe old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting. \nIN THE RING The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the crowd. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout \"Hooray!\" Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki. \nCARY Nikki, here's a present for you. \nNIKKI Oh, a hat! \nPEDRO Oh, se\u00f1or, no, no, no -- you must not keep the hat. You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight. \nCARY What kind of present? \nPEDRO Well, eh - a little jewelry. Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the-- \nCARY Vanilla? \nPEDRO Yes! Vanilla! \nA trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited. \nBILL Look! Here he comes! \nIN THE RING A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each time. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Bill sits next to Pedro. \nPEDRO Nice work! Good work. \nBILL What's so good about it? \nPEDRO He works close to the bull. \nBILL Is that so dangerous? \nPEDRO Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting is very dangerous. It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring. \nBill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query. \nCARY Is it true the bull is blind when he charges? \nPEDRO He sees only the cape -- perhaps. \nIN THE RING Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull. \nIN THE FRONT ROW Bill is unimpressed. \nBILL Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. You know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter. \nPEDRO You should have started at twelve years of old. \nBILL I bet I could start right now. \nCARY (puts a hand on Bill's shoulder) Sit still and behave yourself. \nPEDRO Bull-fighting is not for Americans. \nBILL You think we haven't got the nerve or something? \n", "test2_id": 430, "test3_input": "CARY Did you see the way Francis poured lead into that fellow? \nSHEP Fast work. \nCARY Fast? Chain lightning! \nSHEP Nice shooting. \nCARY Those slugs went right past my ear. If I'd've moved an inch, I would've caught one of them myself. \nSHEP \"Sudden Death,\" all right. \nNikki takes out a cigarette. \nCARY What's the matter with you, Shep? I've never known you so quiet before. \nSHEP That's right. I am kind of quiet. \nNIKKI (holds her unlit cigarette) Not smoking? \nSHEP No. \nNIKKI Your lighter working? \nSHEP Good ol', Nikki -- never has any matches. \nNIKKI No. \nAs Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter, a strange look crosses his face. \nSHEP Sure you want a light? \nNIKKI That's what I want, a light. \nShep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his white shirt. Nikki stares down at the blood in horror. \nNIKKI Shep. Shep! \nNikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite. \nCARY What is it? \nNIKKI Shep's hurt! \nCary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face. \nSHEP It's a forgery. \nCary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound. \nNIKKI Do something for him, Cary! Oh, Shepard! \nCARY He's been shot! \nNIKKI What can we do, Cary?! What can we do?! \nCARY Shep, why didn't you say you were hurt? \nSHEP Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me. \nCARY Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. You'll be all right. We'll get you to a hospital. \nShep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street. \nSHEP No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres. Let's sit here for a while. The-- Hurts, the jolting. \nUrgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver. \nCARY Stop! Stop! \nIn front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening intently. \nSHEP That's better. You know, Cary, I feel - just like we're falling -- long time ago. Do you remember? Spinning ... spinning ... spinning. Only you brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good old Cary. (sighs) Best flyer in the service. \nNikki, seated opposite, is distraught. \nNIKKI Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling. \nCARY (reassuring) We're gonna make a safe landing again, Shep. \nSHEP Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's gonna crash. (beat) Say, but we're spinning fast. Level off. Cary, level off. \nShep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder. \nNIKKI'S VOICE Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling. \n", "test3_true": "CARY Shep? - Shep?! - Shep! \nCary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself to cry. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. TRAIN WHEELS ROAR down a railroad track. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the record -- Toselli's \"Serenade,\" that strange, sad composition that haunted Europe at the close of the Great War. \nAs the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. Then she turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp. \nNIKKI What are you writing, Cary? \nCARY A letter. A letter to Shep's mother. \nNIKKI Mind if I read it? \nCARY Certainly not. \nNikki reads the letter silently. A long pause. \nNIKKI Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most beautiful letter I've ever read. \nNikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly. \nNIKKI Please forgive me for crying, Cary. I can't help it. You don't mind if I cry just a minute, do you? \nCARY No, Nikki. \nCary puts aside the letter. \nNIKKI Can't you cry, Cary? \nCARY No. \nNIKKI But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you? \nCARY Long, long time ago. Before the war. \nNIKKI And you can't cry now? Not even for Shep? \nCARY Shep Lambert spent his life in the war. He had nothing more to give. He had died once. And he was ready to die again. \nNIKKI This time he was played out with music. That was the way he wanted it. \nCARY And Bill Talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts. Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel and - be a big success again. \nNIKKI And Francis? \nCARY Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping. Till the end. It doesn't matter now. Without them, nothing matters. We only had each other. Comradeship was all we had left. And now that's gone, too. \nNIKKI And you, Cary? You? You're alone now. \nCARY That's right. I'm alone now. \nNIKKI I don't want you to be alone, Cary. Let me stay with you. Let me be with you. \nHe takes her hand, looks at her affectionately. \nCARY Why, Nikki. You're sweet. \nHe kisses her hand. A strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone. Cary looks at her in surprise. \nCARY Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't forget. \nShe lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him. \nNIKKI No harm can come to our true love. \nCARY (amused, skeptical) No harm can come to our true love? (genuinely) Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear to me. I want to help you. Can't I do something for you, too? What do you want? What can I get you? \nNIKKI Well, I've always wanted a pair of Spanish earrings. \nHe gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she buries her head lovingly in his shoulder. He kisses her hand again. \nCUT TO \nTHE TRAIN in a dark, bleak landscape as it chugs away down the track. \nDISSOLVE TO \n", "test3_id": 431}

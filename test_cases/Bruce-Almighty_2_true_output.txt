DEBBIE (cheery) No, it's Debbie. The sister who's life you're not wasting. GRACE Hey. Grace GRABS THE PHONE. 
DEBBIE (feigns innocent) What? GRACE Sorry, honey. My sister seems to think she's my mother. Where are you? BRUCE (flying high) Oh, A little place called the winners circle. I'm at the Falls doing a "live" report. GRACE Live? That's greatI BRUCE Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got sweeps and I'm live. You know what that means? (MORE) 
BRUCE (cont'd) They're seeing if I can think on my feet, like you might have to do in a live news anchor situation. GRACE Oh, my gosh. BRUCE This is happening for us, Grace. What we've always talked about. Jack practically came out and told me. Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature- celebration before. GRACE Wait, what do you mean practically? BRUCE Well, he didn't spell it out, but this is exactly what happened to Susan Ortega right before she was bumped up to the desk. GRACE (being cautious) I just want to make sure we're not getting too ahead of ourselves. BRUCE I totally agree, but in the mean time you should start thinking about what coast you want to live on. Ally interrupts, indicating the time. BRUCE Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go. GRACE Good luck, honey. I love you.                          * BRUCE                                       * I love you.                                            * (hangs up)                                        * Debbie turns to Grace.                                           * DEBBIE                                       * Moooo.                                                 *

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places his ear piece. ALLY They want you close to the falls. BRUCE What for? I'll get soaked. ALLY That's the point.    They want you to hold up this. She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA. ALLY Part of the condition of us getting the exclusive. Bruce takes the umbrella. '     '               BRUCE Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes. ALLY Remember, this is their 23rd anniversary. Capacity is 59. They cater to tourists, honeymooners. . . BRUCE And people who are insanely                    '     * thirsty, I get it.                                   * ALLY And you'll be interviewing Irene Dansfeild... She positions A VERY, VERY OLD WOMAN next to Bruce. ALLY ...She rode on the maiden voyage with her late husband. Okay, 90                      * seconds. Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. Mutters encouragement to himself. 
BRUCE 90 seconds, going live. Think anchor, think dignity, (glances up toward umbrella) Ignore umbrella. Just have fun. CUT TO:

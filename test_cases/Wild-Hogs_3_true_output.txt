KAREN Well, I hope you guys had a nice trip. Now get in the van. We're going home. 
BOB Um... Actually, we just decided we were going to keep pressing West for a few-- 
KAREN Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out here, rented a car, drove to this podunk 
LITTLE TOWN-- As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then back to Karen. He can't take it anymore. 
BOB --Karen! Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice. 
BOB (CONT'D) Listen to me. This is My vacation and if I want to ride on with my friends, well that's what I'm going to do! And if you have a problem with that, well... Tough shit! There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds, Karen's face softens. 
KAREN 
(SUDDENLY MEEK) Okay. Sorry... Just... be careful. Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe it. 
BOB I will. And... I love you. Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike. ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug. 
KELLY So are you going, too? 
DOUG I hadn't really decided. I have been having a good time, though.

DOUG (CONT'D) 
(SMILES) I even got beaten up. Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up. 
KELLY There he is! I saw old Doug! Doug blushes. 
DOUG You'll see him even more if you and Billy meet me in San Francisco. We've got a suite at the Ritz-Carlton. Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks concerned. 
KELLY What about work? And Billy's school? Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world. 
DOUG Ahh. We can risk it. Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob. 
DOUG (CONT'D) We ready? 
WOODY I think so. Dudley? What do you think? The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody. 
DUDLEY Let's ride. They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY 
The four motorcycles (and one sidecar) cruise down the open highway. The guys smile as the wind blows in their faces. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 120. It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit, and he opens his mouth: 
DOUG 
(SINGING) I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back. I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back... I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride! I'm wanted... The other guys smile and join in: 
DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY Dead or alive! They all look at each other as they continue to sing over the roar of the engines: 
DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY (CONT'D) Ohh, I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side! 
I'M WANTED-- 
DOUG Wante-ee--ed! 
DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY Dead or aliiiivvvee! 
MUSIC CUE: BON JOVI'S "WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE." The camera slowly PULLS OUT TO AN AERIAL SHOT, as the guys joyfully ride along the sunlit highway. It's a good day to be a Wild Hog. 
FADE OUT:

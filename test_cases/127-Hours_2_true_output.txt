And now the motion and energy and life force of the action movie returns... It's like Ray Liotta's final day in Goodfellas; relentless, frustrating, pressure of life again now he's free from his tomb. Deeper and deeper, down and down into the swirling scoops of the sandstone. Couple of difficult manoeuvres, lots of slipping and bumping, despite his best effort occasionally his right shoulder takes the brunt and he stops, winces and grunts thru the pain. 
But on he goes, 100 ft of the rope trailing behind him. As we follow its progress snaking after him we see specs of blood on the lower walls. 
The canyon becomes a chute increasingly steep in which he ignores the shrinking daylight above because he has another target; the twists and turns of the curricles of sedimented sandstone lead to a soft glow, red, translucent, growing and growing in intensity. He pushes forward, the tail of rope whipping faster and faster along the walls and floor. 
CUT TO: 
INT/EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY. 
Finally, we burst into the dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf halfway up a sheer walled amphitheatre, 200ft high. The scale of the slated cliff face opposite is breathtaking, the dazzling sunlight poaches the air he sucks in and burns his dry eyes. He sees, for the first time in his new life, green. The deep green of a healthy 50ft tree below him and to his left, and he knows. He looks for the bolts drilled into the rock, and he knows. Now he can look down. Right to the edge of vertiginous drop and there below is a puddle of shallow turgid water. Life itself. He wanted it to be there and now he's mesmerized by it. A pair of swifts leave the tree and zig zag up and around him. He wobbles and has to stop himself lunging head first over the precipice. Instead he drops to the bolts and kisses them like the pope arriving in a foreign land. 
Unravelling the rope of its knots, he's baking in blazing 
light. He can't go yet, every knot must be undone pulled open between his teeth and his hand. But he'll die if he can't have moisture. He tips the saved urine over himself and licking and retching simultaneously he suddenly stops and listens. He can hear a shuffling, a zip-zip... The rope is uncoiling over the ledge. He put it down to drink. Picking up speed the more it falls, there's only a few feet left. He lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. That was his future disappearing over the ledge. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CANYON. DAY 
We're far below - 6 storeys - and see him inch over the edge. Something's not right. It's a difficult overhang and he's awkward and vulnerable with only one useful arm. His bad arm catches horribly on the lip of the ledge. Suddenly he starts coming fast, faster and then hideously, much too fast, accelerating out of control and smashing into the water with deadly force. 
CUT TO: 
INT. UNDERWATER. DAY. 
We're underneath, deep in the pool, and he crashes in an explosive cascade of air forced into the water. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. C/U: DAY. 
His feet gently touch the sandy floor, 10ft to the side of the pool... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. POOL. DAY 
... he's a great climber and even in his present condition has perfectly executed the descent. And the pool is a puddle, swimming with dead leaves and insects, 2 inches deep at most. He falls on it with his bottles, filling them and dipping his mouth into the water, He washes his head, drinks and fills, drinks and gargles, and drinks again-insects, leaves, tadpoles, everything. Blood splashes in beside him so out comes his map again as he plots his way out. He sees a great goose- necked avenue before him bending to the right. 
Checking the map... there's a long way to go and he's small, nothing in this landscape. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. (VARIOUS)CANYON. DAY. 
He walks shedding any weight that might reduce how long he can keep going; his equipment, carabiners, headphones; his harness left like a spent snake skin behind him. He keeps to the shadows of the huge Monument Valley-like cliffs when he can. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HORSESHOE CANYON. DAY. 
Finally, he comes to the great gallery that we saw in the opening titles. A 300ft huge wall with dozens of broad shouldered figures painted to enormous scale in all shades of tan and maroon. They seem to stare back at him. He salutes them in his own way and continues. 
He banks left beneath a colossal alcove high up in the cliff face and makes to the flattest ground - there's no shade to hide in here.

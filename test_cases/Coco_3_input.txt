CLERK (to Imelda) Then you hand the petal to Miguel. 
Imelda extends the petal to Miguel, who reaches for it. 
He grabs the petal. WHOOOOSH!        He's consumed by a whirlwind of petals and disappears. 
DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT 
He reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's solid. He runs to the window and looks out. 
MIGUEL No skeletons! 
Miguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar. 
Miguel quickly grabs the guitar. 
MIGUEL Mariachi Plaza, here I come-- 
He takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH! 
CLERK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME 
Miguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family turns, shocked to see him back so soon. 
Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding position. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Two seconds and you already break your promise! 
MIGUEL This isn't fair, it's my life!     You already had yours! 
Miguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Papá Julio. 
MIGUEL Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing. 
Papá Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe?       Tía Victoria? 
They all shake their heads. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go home my way, or no way. 
MIGUEL You really hate music that much? 
MAMÁ IMELDA I will not let you go down the same path he did. 
Miguel gets an idea.     He pulls the photo out and turns from the group. 
MIGUEL The same path he did. 
He gazes at the man with no face. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) (to himself) He's family... 
TÍA VICTORIA Listen to your Mamá Imelda. 
TÍO OSCAR She's just looking out for you. 
TÍA ROSITA Be reasonable. 
Miguel starts back toward the door. 
MIGUEL Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back! 
Miguel sees himself out.      The family waits for a beat. 
CLERK Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead? 
INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER 
Miguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. Tío Oscar asks a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie. 
Miguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door exit. 
MIGUEL Vámonos. 
Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole, and heads out. Dante pads after him. 
PATROLWOMAN We got a family looking for a LIVING BOY. 
MIGUEL If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa. 
The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN. 
PATROLMAN Hold it, muchacho. 
Miguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face. 
PATROLMAN Ahh! 
The patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie. 
PATROLMAN I've found that living boy! 
A large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty, arms full of offerings. 
PATROLMAN Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me folks! Excuse me--

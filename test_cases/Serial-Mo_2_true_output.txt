CHIP Thanks, Mom. 
As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing enough to make MOM's head explode. 
DAD (Reading paper) Look at this! (Reading out loud in disgust) "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!" 
MOM (Preoccupied, stalking fly) That's nice. 
DAD Nice?!  He should have been executed! 
MISTY He killed people, Mom. 
MOM (To herself) We all have bad nights. (Gets ready to swat, but fly buzzes off) 
CHIP (To MISTY) You'd probably date him! (Mimicking her) He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?" 
DAD I certainly did not. 
MISTY You've been working in that video shop too long. 
DAD And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork. 
MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's building anger. 
CHIP I do great in school, Dad. (Eats toast as fly buzzes off) 
A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the rim in closeup. 
DAD Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away) 
CHIP (Giving a pleading look to MOM as the buzzing of the fly builds in intensity on the soundtrack) Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins! 
MOM (Moving in for the kill, hissing the words in a rage) Don't say the word "hate", honey. "Hate" is a very serious word! 
MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears). 
Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack. 
MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at her family. 
MOM There.  All better. (Suddenly all innocence) Anybody for scrambled eggs? 
END OF CREDITS. 
A loud banging is heard on the back door.  MOM jumps up guiltily. 
DAD (Getting up from table) Who on earth...? 
MOM opens door to two police detectives in plain clothes.  DETECTIVE MOORE is younger and more rugged than the older more world-weary DETECTIVE BRADFORD. 
DET. MOORE Mrs. Sutphin? 
MOM (Nervously) Yes? 
DET. MOORE (Shows badge) I'm Detective Moore and this is Detective Bradford. 
Subtitle appears "7:26am" and then fades out. 
DAD (Taking over) I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's the trouble, officer? 
CHIP (Excitedly) Is there a killer loose? 
DET. MOORE No son, nothing that exciting. 
MOM This is my son, Chip...and my daughter, Misty. 
MISTY (Inappropriately making eyes at the younger cop) Hi!

INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
as Suzy's eyes flash open. 
SUZY Did you hear that? 
JIM Hear what? 
He pulls her back down. 
SUZY C'mon, I'm serious. 
He knows the mood is broken. 
JIM All right, I'll check it out. 
He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the sheet up around her fearfully. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK) 
as the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to find the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. JASON IS GONE. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
Suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim has left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes. 
SUZY Jimmy...? 
No answer. Her heart starts to pound. 
SUZY Jim...? 
Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. The ship creaks again. 
SUZY'S POINT OF VIEW 
as she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch- black beyond it. 
SUZY Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it... 
...And just as she reaches the door: 
A HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER 
leaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time to scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST. 
SUZY 
stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. But there's no blood. 
THE MONSTER 
pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it aside. 
JIM Gotcha good, baby cakes. 
She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, laughing. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK 
sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
as Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying unsuccessfully to kiss her. 
JIM All right, all right -- I'm a major ass. 
SUZY And you'll never do it again. 
JIM And I'll never do it again. Forgive me? 
SUZY No. 
She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around him, finally giving in. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 
The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now. 
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR 
Nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered BARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME. 
SUZY 
closes her eyes with pleasure... 
ANGLE - CABIN DOOR 
...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked face of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.

Betty gets up, stares at the door, then at Rita. Rita waits, not knowing what to do. \nBETTY It'll be okay. \nBetty opens the door.

Who are you? \nLOUISE Someone is in trouble. Who are you? Why are you in Ruth's apartment? \nBETTY I'm her niece. She's letting me stay here. My name is Betty. \nLOUISE No it isn't. That's not it.

God, I've been trying to find you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock. That one is in my room and she won't leave. I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now. \nCoco comes up and grabs hold of Louise. She turns over to Betty. \nCOCO This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she meant well. (looking over to Louise) This is Betty, Ruth's niece. In fact and fortunately I was just coming to see Betty. Betty's a young actress and I'm delivering faxed pages of a scene for her audition tomorrow. Here they are honey. Now come along Louise and I'll take you home. (back to Betty) Sorry about this. Sometimes it happens. \nLOUISE No, she said it was someone else in trouble. \nCOCO Stop it, Louise.

He knocks softly on the door. The door opens and Adam Kesher is standing there - still beaten looking with remnants of pink paint. \nADAM Yes...what is it? \nHOTEL MANAGER I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card. \nADAM ... What?? \nHOTEL MANAGER The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us. \nADAM How...  how'd they know I was here? \nHOTEL MANAGER I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files. \nADAM So, what did they say? \nHOTEL MANAGER Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled. \nADAM Unbelievable. Look... here. (Adam taking out his wallet.) I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay? \nHOTEL MANAGER That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you. \nADAM Fine.

Where are you Adam? \nADAM What do you mean \"you know\"? \nCYNTHIA Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls. \nADAM And? \nCYNTHIA You're broke! \nADAM But I'm not broke. \nCYNTHIA I know, but you're broke. Where are you? \nADAM Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night. \nCYNTHIA Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy? \nADAM The Cowboy?? \nCYNTHIA Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you.

Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range? \nCYNTHIA Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon.

When? \nCYNTHIA I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place. \nADAM Cynthia... that would not be a good idea. \nCYNTHIA I'm just offering a place to stay. \nADAM I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer.

BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT \nAdam, in his Porsche, makes his way up the canyon. \nINT. PORSCHE \nAdam feeling like a fool drives up the dark, winding canyon road. As he nears the top of the canyon the residential area gives way to desert brush. The road winds steeply up to a dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit. Adam parks in a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral. His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about. No one is around. There's only a light wind and a few twinkling stars in the sky above. Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from the corral gate flare up. Adam hears a noise in the brightness and turns. There walking toward him into the light is the Cowboy - dressed in clean blue denim jeans, well-oiled unscuffed, beautifully engraved cowboy boots, a red embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt complete with string tie. Atop the Cowboy's head is a 10 X white Stetson. The Cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches. He stops in front of Adam and begins to speak with a true, slow Western drawl. \nCOWBOY Howdy! \nADAM Howdy to you. \nCOWBOY Beautiful night. \nADAM Yeah. \nCOWBOY Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel. \nADAM No problem. What's on your mind? \nCOWBOY Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya? \nADAM Whatever. \nCOWBOY A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with? \nADAM Sure. \n", "test2_true": "ADAM I agree with what you said...truly. \nCOWBOY What did I say? \nADAM That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be. \nCOWBOY So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life. \nADAM How's that? \nCOWBOY Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me? \nADAM Okay, I'm thinking. \nCOWBOY No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me? \nADAM Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do? \nCOWBOY There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? \nADAM One. \nCOWBOY So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me. \nADAM Okay. \nCOWBOY Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault... \nAdam suddenly looks stunned, unsure. \nCOWBOY (cont'd) ... realizin' you don't have hardly a nickel to your name and then add on to that the sickenin' feeling some men are gonna catch you and hurt you bad for bustin' their vehicle. Some days are like that. They are rough, but what will tomorrow bring? Will it be better than today? The same ... or worse? A lot of that is up to us individually. Up to us and our attitude. When the Castigliane brothers said \"This is no longer your film,\" they meant it, but they didn't mean you were not going to direct it. I want you to go back to work tomorrow. You were re-casting the lead actress anyway ... audition many girls for the part. When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say \" This is the girl.\" The rest of the cast can stay- that is up to you, but that lead girl is not up to you. Now, you will see me one more time if you do good. You will see me two more times if you do bad. Good night. \nThe Cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness. Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door opening and closing, then another opening and closing and then the sound of the car driving away. Adam walks up in the direction the Cowboy took, but he sees no sign of a car nor any dust nor any road. He goes back down past the barn and stables to his car. There standing by his Porsche is the Cowboy. \nCOWBOY (cont'd) You thinkin' this'll work out, cause I was thinkin' it just might. \nADAM It will work out. \nCOWBOY Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that? \nADAM I understand. \nCOWBOY You're an understandin' fella. \nADAM So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad? \nCOWBOY No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again. \nADAM Okay. \nAdam gets in his car and drives off leaving the Cowboy smiling behind him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

She speaks firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear. \nBETTY Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you! \nRITA (whispering back) But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble. \nBETTY You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble. \nRita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and doubt all over again. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAB - LATER \nBetty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand. She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides of the street. \nBETTY It should be around here... \nRita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up Sierra Bonita. They near a modern apartment compound of bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and vegetation. A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex. \nBETTY (cont'd) (points) That's it ... 2590. (nudging Rita) Does it look familiar? \nRita shakes her head..no. Rita is looking at a black car parked down the street facing 2590. She discerns two men sitting in the front. \nRITA Don't stop! \nBETTY What is it? What do you see?! \nRITA (quietly - frantic) Those men in front, in the car. \nBETTY Do you know them?! \nRITA No... but... \nBETTY (to driver) Keep going. Go around to the back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

The girls go through a rear gate and enter the complex walking along a curving concrete walk. This leads them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a rough hewn wooden plaque. They scan the list. \nBETTY Selwyn ... number 12. \nThey both look around the various doors near them. Betty spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10 through #20. \nBETTY (cont'd) It's this way. \nThey set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow #12. As they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a chainlink service gate to the alley.

Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay as still and quiet as possible. \nBETTY (cont'd) (panting whisper) Now, you've got me scared. \nPeering through the bushes they see the man still looking in their direction. Suddenly he turns and smiles at something to his left. \nHe hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress. Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward. They see the limo and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary limousine driver just going about his work. The girls stand up, relieved and a little embarrassed. \nBETTY (cont'd) See, I told you there was nothing to be afraid of! \nThey go up to Bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the front door. \nRITA Oh no ... don't. \nBetty doesn't listen to Rita. She knocks strongly on the door. They stand waiting. There's no answer so Betty knocks again harder. They wait. \nRITA (cont'd) No one's ... \nSuddenly the door opens. An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands before them. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Yes? \nBETTY Diane? \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN Number 17. \nBETTY But it said #12. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right. \nThe woman seems to be looking now at Rita. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd) It's kind of hidden by the foliage. \nBetty and Rita start to leave. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd) She hasn't been around for a few days ... \nBETTY Well ... we'll leave her a note. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (starting toward them) I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff. \nThe phone rings from inside her bungalow. \nMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (cont'd) (turning back) Oh ... go ahead. I've got to get that. \nThe woman hurries back inside and closes the door. Betty and Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow #17. \nBETTY I guess you're not Diane. \nRita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer. \nThey reach Bungalow #17. It's set back beneath tall bushes and an old Eucalyptus tree. The front door is in deep shadow. Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly. There's no answer. She knocks again. \nBETTY (cont'd) Still not home I guess. \nThe girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. Betty tries to see in the windows. She tries a window and to her surprise it opens. \nRITA I don't think... \nBETTY (looking around for anyone watching) C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door. \n", "test3_id": 101}

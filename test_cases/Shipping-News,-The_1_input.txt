QUOYLE Three hours to drive from the Point, with all the ice. Alvin won't have my boat ready til New Years. Agnis can stay over her shop. Bunny and I have to find a room in town. 
DENNIS Stay with us. My kid follows yours around, they'll bunk t'gether. And we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n you deserve. 
A good friend.     Quoyle is touched. 
QUOYLE 
Hopin' you'd offer, almost worth it just t'inconvenience ya. Unfortunately, I'm too fond a yer wife. 
NUTBEEM (casual) Take my trailer. Timing's perfect. 
The way he said that.     They both turn.     A shrug... 
NUTBEEM It's two years. My boat's ready. If I stay any longer, I'll begin to like it here. 
Wouldn't want that. Very silent at this table.            Against the din of the place. Is he serious? 
NUTBEEM (softly) I'm throwing myself a farewell party on Saturday. Departure to follow Sunday. Regrets, soon after, no doubt. 
And smiles.    Serious as a heart attack.      A long beat. 
QUOYLE (a murmur) Be careful. 
Careful? 
QUOYLE Last friend left me.      Turned into a truck driver. 
So much feeling behind his eyes.     Nutbeem can only say... 
NUTBEEM Well.   With that warning. 
And return the feeling.     With his own. 
EXT./INT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT 
Quoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum pulled from the back of his wagon. Plenty more to go. Staggers into... 
...Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface under stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese and red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice. Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom... 
QUOYLE What's the barrel for? 
SEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciled 
in orange, fills the shower stall. 
NUTBEEM I'm British. I bathe. 
Quoyle sends him a blank look. 
QUOYLE Perfect for th' chips. 
He gestures to thirty bags of potato chips, filling the kitchenette. 
NUTBEEM It's coated with two kinds of scum. Soap. And mine. 
QUOYLE Works.    We forgot to buy dip. 
INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
VIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving. We are immersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfie soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we struggle to look around... 
...every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks. Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has become a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle fights his way... 
...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH wilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around Jack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A FIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in, to hear... 
QUOYLE (shouting against the din) SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH. 
Jack nods.   Grins.    That's pretty funny. 
QUOYLE THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!' AND HE JUMPS. 
This.   Is even funnier. 
QUOYLE NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON THE GIRDER. HE OPENS HIS BOX. 'HOLY MOLEY! BOLOGNA SANDWICH AGAIN! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS!' AND LEAPS OFF. 
Funniest yet.   Jack is chuckling already. 
QUOYLE AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!' 
Quoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes. 
JACK YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE. 
QUOYLE OH, YAR.    FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
At which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants... 
JACK MADE HIS OWN LUNCH! 
POUNDING on poor Quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics. Nearby, the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no small distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE. Even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention. 
BIG UGLY GUY NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN' NUTBEEM, YAR??? 
Cries of YAR! fill the woods. Nutbeem himself is HOISTED on shoulders, whooping and sloshing his grog. 
BIG UGLY GUY SO LESS KEEP 'IM 'ERE BYES! AXE 'IS FOOKIN' BOAT! GOT YER CHAIN SAW, NEDDIE?? 
An idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL. Soused Nutbeem's eyes open bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks. Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective. 
And rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone. 
Among the conscious, that is. 
INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

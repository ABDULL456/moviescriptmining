BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out, kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS... 
MARLA You motherfuckers... 
They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE. 
Jack leans against the railing, exhausted. 
TYLER I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla. 
JACK Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan? 
Tyler thinks, shrugs. 
TYLER Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem." 
JACK Fuck your struggle.  I want out. 
TYLER You want out? 
JACK I quit. 
TYLER Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program. (looks at his watch) Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here. 
Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He points the gun at Tyler... 
JACK Tyler... 
TYLER (still walking away) What? 
JACK (COCKS the gun) Defuse the bomb. 
Tyler stops walking. 
TYLER Ask me nicely. 
JACK Defuse the bomb, please. 
TYLER Defuse the bomb? 
JACK Yes. 
Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun... 
JACK Please. 
Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS. 
Jack lowers his gun. 
TYLER I did that for you.  As a gesture. Now, how fast can you run?  There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in the immediate area.  If you're going to get them all, you better get cracking. (looks at watch) Six minutes.  Green wires, remember. I'll be upstairs. 
Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past Jack, heading for the STAIRS. 
Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES! 
Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding... 
Tyler spins to face Jack. 
TYLER Whoa!  What was that all about? 
Jack aims... FIRES! 
Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE. 
Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps, moving the gun from side to side... 
Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face. 
Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor... 
Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun, scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun... 
Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling. 
Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows... 
INT. STAIRWELL 
Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR... 
INT. MAIN LOBBY 
Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor. 
Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his gun... 
TYLER Fire at will. 
Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler. Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms. 
TYLER What did you expect? 
Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking each other to the floor... 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned. 
ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor, alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up, punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING himself in the side of the head... 
INT. MAIN LOBBY 
Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's head against the floor... 
SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V. 
... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his own head against the floor, over and over... 
INT. MAIN LOBBY 
Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away. Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

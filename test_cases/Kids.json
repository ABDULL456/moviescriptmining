So Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid. \nCasper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother. And they don't even notice Casper at first. \nTELLY (V.O.) And he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches. \nCasper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him. All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out. \nTELLY (V.O.) And you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake. \nCasper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man. \nCasper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man. \nThe man falls off the bed and onto the floor. \nCasper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked, with blood all over her body. There is blood all over the sheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics. \nCASPER'S MOM You fuck!!! It's your father!!!

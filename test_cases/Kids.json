{"train": "Kids \nHarmony Korine \nBLACK SCREEN \nThe very loud sound of people having sex. The sounds of deep moaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the sound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two people are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be painful and raw. \nGIRL (O.S.) Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nThe face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair. Her face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her, looking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having sex with. She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is red-hot and sweaty. Every time she moves, she makes a deep moaning noise. She looks likes she's on the verge of pain and ecstasy. \nGIRL Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly. \nThe CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the girl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty, slightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a street-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of them are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post smashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical moaning of the two. \nRAPID FADE TO BLACK \nBACK IN TIME - BEFORE THEY HAD SEX \nTelly is in bed with the girl. The two of them are sitting up in the big bed that is raised high of the ground. Telly is naked except for a tight pair of white underwater. He is sitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart. The girl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one of her nipples is poking through. The two of them are very sweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great feeling of heat and wetness. \nThe windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of outside traffic is circulating. There is a small fan on her dresser that is blowing from side to side. Socks, shirts, and pants are lying on her hard wood floor. The room is neat except for the clothing. A large poster of the Beastie Boys hangs on the wall. She has many stuffed animals on her bed and dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the corner. \nTelly and the girl are looking at each other. \nThe girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent beauty about her. \nTELLY You know what I want to do? \nGIRL Yeah. \nTELLY What do I want to do? \nGIRL You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me. \nTELLY (smiling) Why? \nGIRL Because, you know why. You know. \nTELLY Because your a virgin? \nGIRL Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby. \nTELLY You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff. \nGIRL Why is that? \nTELLY Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it. \nGIRL I wouldn't believe it? \nTELLY I don't know. I just think that you would love it. \nGIRL But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us. \nTELLY What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change. (he begins to caress her cheek and hair) I want to make you happy. That's all. \nTelly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her. He sticks his tongue in her mouth. They kiss. \nTELLY (whispering) You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise. \nGIRL (whispering) Do you care about me? \nTELLY (whispering) Of course I do. \nTELLY Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. \nCASPER Yeah. \nTELLY But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good. \nCASPER How did she smell? Did her puss stink? \nTelly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose. \nTELLY Take a whiff. \nCasper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers. \nCASPER Oh man, it smells like butterscotch. \nTELLY Hell's yeah. She was so clean. \nCASPER Oh man, that's the best. \nTELLY You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom. \nCASPER Let me smell it again. \nTelly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor. \nCASPER That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell. \nAs they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by. \nTELLY You know what else? \nCASPER What? \nTELLY I can tell that she had just entered puberty. \nCASPER How? \nTELLY Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. \nCASPER Right. \nTELLY And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little. \nCASPER Yeah. \nTELLY And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup. \nCasper starts to crack up. \nTELLY And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby. \nCASPER Yeah. \nTELLY And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl. \nThey both laugh. \nCASPER Fuckin perverted bastard. \nThey continue to laugh and walk. \nTELLY I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit. \nCASPER To what? Virgins? \nTELLY Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies. \nCASPER It's no big deal, right? \nTELLY Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it. \nCASPER Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. (they both start laughing) It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first. \nTELLY Yep. \nCASPER They're gonna tell their grand kids. (mimicking an old lady) That Telly. He sure was good in the sack! \nThe two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited. \nThey walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool. \nTELLY You thirsty? \nCASPER Yeah, I feel dehydrated. \nTELLY You got any money? \nCASPER Three pennies and a ball of lint. \nTELLY You down with the boost? \nCASPER (whispers) Unzip my pack, yo. \nHe turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack. \nINT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY \nThe grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch buffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN MAN. He is watching a small black and white television set. \nThe two boys enter. \nCasper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer. \nTelly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash register. \nTELLY Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg? \nKOREAN STORE OWNER Whah? \nTELLY Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it? \nKOREAN STORE OWNER Whah is dissdee? \nCasper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two 40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor. \nTELLY Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg. \nKOREAN STORE OWNER I no understand you. Maybe crazy. \nA round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into his backpack. \nTELLY I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg? \nKOREAN STORE OWNER Whah you say? Dissdee? \nCasper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch. \nCASPER He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English? \nThe two of them both run out the door. \nTelly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket. \nThe two boys run off. \nThere are about ten guys in the apartment. There is almost no furniture, just two white couches and a few plants in the corner. There is a big TV in the center of the floor. A Nintendo with several wires is hooked up to it. There are various games spread out. A couple of boys are huddled around the game, as they watch the guy play, they breathe in the wip-it's. \nThe boys are all young and spread out. There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its. They are all colors and sizes. \nCasper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake. Some people they hug. They say \"Was up,\" to everyone. \nThey both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers. \nPaul sits down besides them. \nPAUL What are you guys doing? \nTELLY Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to. \nPAUL You want a wip-it? \nTELLY Nah. \nCASPER Yeah. \nPaul puts his hand on his big pocket and gives Casper a cartridge. Casper breathes in the wip-it and then smiles really big. \nCASPER I love these shits. \nPAUL They're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation. \nPaul hands Casper another cartridge. \nCASPER That's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up. \nCasper does the wip-it. \nSTANLEY, a tall black kid with dreads, walks out of the kitchen. He has a cordless phone in his hand. Casper continues to do wip-it's. One after another. \nTELLY So, how many people live here now? \nPAUL I don't know, eight or nine. \nTELLY Where does everyone sleep? \nPAUL Everywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub. \nSTANLEY Yo Telly. Jennie says what's up. \nTELLY Jennie who? \nSTANLEY Jennie. You know. \nCASPER That girl you boned last year. Remember? \nTELLY Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to? \nINT. RUBY'S ROOM - DAY \nFive girls are sitting in a small room. They are smoking. They're all in a circle laughing. The girls are all good friends. A few of them have rings in their lips and eyebrows. A big dirty fish tank is on one of the bookshelves. \nRuby is a nice looking girl, age 17. She is Spanish, her hair is slicked back, she chain-smokes. \nJennie is a 15 year old high school sophomore. She is white. She is very pretty, with an uncommon touch of innocence about her. \nThe next episode is going to jump-cut back and forth between Paul's apartment and Rubby's room. These scenes should be handheld. \nRuby hangs up the phone. \nRUBY Telly says was up. \nJENNIE I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick. \nSUSAN Yep. \nLINDA Because he can like climax you up to that... \nJENNIE ... Point. \nLINDA Yep.

What the hell happened?! \nRUBY Yeah it's the biggest disappointment! \nSUSAN Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever \nRUBY To come? \nSUSAN Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half. \nLINDA Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes. \nRUBY Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep. \nLINDA Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored. \nRUBY Yeah I get bored. \nLINDA I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards. \nSUSAN Yeah, eat. I got real thirsty too. \nLaughter. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nContinued talking. \nCasper is playing the video game. He is playing with a great deal of intensity. \nCASPER You know what I notice? \nZACK What? \nCASPER I notice that girls love to give head. It's like a secret pastime hobby for them. Or somethin'. \nSTANLEY Some girls. \nCASPER All girls. They love it. I know. \nCasper's game finishes. \nCASPER (under his breath) I hate this game. \nTELLY No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends. \nPAUL Yeah. But when it's just you and them. That's like the first thing they go for. \nCasper starts a new game. \nCASPER I know. They love it. That's why girls live longer than guys. 'Cause sperm has vitamin C. \nINT. RUBY'S ROOM - DAY \nIn the midst of their conversation. \nContinued talking. \nRUBY I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative. \nLINDA Yeah. \nRUBY And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe. \nLINDA Yeah. \nRUBY And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie. \nJennie looks embarrassed. \nRUBY I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone. \nLINDA Did they ask you a lot of questions? \nINT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nRuby is sitting across from a BLACK NURSE. The nurse has a clipboard in her hand. She is sitting at a small desk that is cluttered with papers and pictures of her kids. The room is decorated on shades of bright yellow. There are pictures of clowns on the wall. There is a large paper diagram on the wall that traces, step by step, the process of inserting a condom. \nRuby is chewing gum and tapping her feet. She scratches her elbow. \nThe black nurse is very overweight; she talks with a strong New York accent. She sips a coffee mug that reads \"I love Mom.\" \nBLACK NURSE How old you? \nRUBY \nINT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nJennie is sitting across from a very skinny WHITE NURSE. The nurse has a clip board in her head. Spanish rock music is sleeping through the walls. A small desk fan is rotating back and forth. The room is dirty. \nJennie is sitting in a chair. She looks very pretty and child-like. She is facing downward and her hair is falling into her face. \nJennie speaks in a low voice. \nWHITE NURSE How old are you? \nJENNIE \nINT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nThe black nurse scratches her scalp and it makes a noise. \nBLACK NURSE How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? \nRUBY Umm. Altogether? \nBLACK NURSE Yes. Altogether. \nRUBY Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine. \nBLACK NURSE How many times have you gone unprotected? \nRUBY With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection.

TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nThe white nurse scribbles something down. \nWHITE NURSE How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with? \nJENNIE One. \nWHITE NURSE Were you protected? \nTypical waiting room. Big sofas and chairs. A table is in the middle of the floor, magazines and pocketbooks. A water jug is in the corner. A ceiling fan is circling fast up above. \nAn assortment of men and women of different races and colors. They look mainly middle class. Jennie and Ruby are the youngest people in the room. \nA man in a three-piece suit slowly walks by. Jennie tries to see his face but he is turned the wrong way. Ruby continues to talk. \nThe same fat black nurse walks out with a clipboard. She begins to cough tremendously. \nRUBY ... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares... \nRuby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse. She is coughing uncontrollably. She looks like a large shaking figure. A skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing. \nThe black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery. She turns and looks at Ruby. \nBLACK NURSE Woowee! It must have been something I ate! (coughs then smiles) Ruby, follow me. \nRuby stands up and looks at Jennie. Ruby crosses both her fingers and raises them in the air. \nRUBY Wish me luck. \nJENNIE Good luck. \nRuby follows the black nurse. This should be one long shot, as Ruby follows the nurse through the hectic testing clinic. The two of them enter the same room as before. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - DAY \nThe skinny white nurse picks up a folder with Jennie's name on it. She opens the door to the waiting room and looks at Jennie sitting down with her eyes closed. \nWHITE NURSE Jennie. \nJennie stands up and smiles. She walks towards the door. \nINT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nRuby is sitting down in a chair. The black nurse picks up a file from the back of the door. She opens it and smiles. \nBLACK NURSE (cough, pause) Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. \nRUBY Yes! \nBLACK NURSE You're clean. \nRUBY Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night. \nBLACK NURSE Now you gotta be careful. \nThe black nurse pulls out a bunch of pamphlets. \nBLACK NURSE Here take these pamphlets home and read them. \nINT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY \nJennie is standing up. She is hugging herself. The white nurse is sitting down at her desk. The nurse looks real closely at the folder and then shuts it. \nWHITE NURSE Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. \nJENNIE What? \nWHITE NURSE The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... \nJENNIE I tested positive? \nWHITE NURSE I'm sorry. \nJENNIE But I only had sex with Telly. \nThe nurse is quiet. \nTELLY I don't know. Find a job. (pause) Hey can I borrow some money? \nCasper is staring at Telly's mom as she breast-feeds. \nMOM Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job. \nTELLY But then I won't need your money. \nMOM That's right. \nCasper is staring at Telly's mom's breast. \nCASPER Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big. \nTELLY Yeah. \nTelly walks out of the kitchen and up the stairs, Casper slowly staggers behind. \nAs they walk up the stairs, Telly pulls his shirt off and wipes his underarms and chest. \nCasper pulls Telly's arm. \nCASPER Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties. \nTELLY Shut the fuck up. \nThe two of them enter Telly's parents room. \nINT. TELLY'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - DAY \nThe bedroom is messy. There are clothes lying on the bed and floor. There is an exercise bike in the corner. Museum posters are on the wall. Tampons on the dresser. \nCasper follows Telly into the bedroom. Telly sticks his head out the door to make sure his mother isn't coming. \nCasper picks up a tampon and starts playing with it. \nTelly opens his mother's shoe closet. All her shoes hand from a big wooden door. He goes directly to a pair of black dress pumps. He pulls out the shoes and puts them under his arm, then he puts his hand in the shot slot and pulls out a pair of shoulder pads with a rubber band rapped around them. He pulls off the rubber brand, and in between the shoulder pads is a small wad of cash. He takes out the cash and sits on the bed counting it. \nCasper is pushing the tampon back and forth inside the plastic shell. \nCASPER How do these things work? \nTelly is counting the cash. \nTELLY Twent, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty. \nCasper is looking at himself in the mirror. \nCASPER How much you gonna take? \nTELLY I don't know. How much do you want? \nCasper is looking at teeth in the mirror. \nCASPER About ten. Fifteen is good. \nTELLY Fifteen for me. \nHe puts fifteen dollars in his back pocket. \nTELLY Ten for you. \nCasper is scrapping his teeth with the tampon while looking in the mirror. \nTelly stands up and hands Casper the ten dollars. Caper puts the money in his back pocket. \nTelly picks up his mother's shoulder pads and puts the remaining cash between them. He stuffs the shoulder pads into the shoe slot. He picks up his mother's black pumps and puts them into the slot. He shuts the door. \nTELLY Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks. \nMOM If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name. \nTELLY All right. \nCasper waves good-bye. \nMOM Bye. \nCasper and Telly leave. Telly slams the door behind him. The baby wakes up and starts to cry. \nMOM Shit. \nEXT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nJennie walks up the stairs to Paul's apartment. She takes her finger down the list of names. \nShe rings his bell. Paul sounds really messed up. \nPAUL (from the speaker, laughter and noise) Hello. \nJENNIE Hello Paul. Is Telly inside? \nPAUL (laughing) Is Telly there? \nPAUL This is Paul. Who is this? \nJENNIE It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there. \nPAUL (drunkenly, laughter) Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me? \nJENNIE I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly? \nPAUL Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too. \nJennie walks down the stairs. A little white girl is sitting on the bottom stair, playing with a black doll. The doll has no hair and it's dress is ripped. She looks up at Jennie. \nLITTLE GIRL My dolly is black... Lucy. \nThe girl sticks her doll out so Jennie can hold it. \nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY \nCasper and Telly are standing by the chess tables. The park is very busy. Every chess table is being used. People are riding bikes and roller-blading. Strong men are doing pull-ups on the monkey bars while guys walk by with ghetto blasters. A state of public frenzy. \nA Rastafarian drug dealer with a big dread cap is standing a little bit away from Telly and Casper. He is approaching everyone as they walk by him. \nDRUG DEALER (fast and slurred) ... Sess... Smoke, hash, shrooms, valium, coke... Sessamila. \nCASPER Yo, was up Ras! \nRAS Ah Caspa! Was up little blood clot? \nCasper and Telly walk up and shake his hand. \nCASPER Nuffin. You gots? \nRAS Shoot yeah boy. Fuckin best herb. Uptown shit boy. \nTELLY None of that twigs and pebbles shit. \nAnother guy trying to sell drugs walks up, but Ras just pushes him away. \nTelly pulls the money out of his back pocket. \nRas pulls out a dime bag and pushes it open. He looks around and then puts it in Casper's face. \nHAMILTON Break that shit up. \nCasper is smushing the pot up. Hamilton is taking the plastic of the cigar. In this shot they go through the complete process of rolling a blunt. The next sequence should be done with fast edits. \nHAMILTON Cut it. \nHamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long thumbnail. \nHAMILTON Scrape it. \nHe then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto the ground. \nHAMILTON Lick it. \nHe then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp. \nHAMILTON Dump it. \nCasper starts putting the weed inside, Hamilton licks it, then pulls out a lighter and dries it. \nHAMILTON And smoke it. \nHamilton puts it in his mouth. \nHAMILTON You wanna start off? \nHamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face. \nCASPER Naw, you got it Ham. \nHamilton smiles. \nHAMILTON All right. \nHe puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it. A big flame shoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie. Hamilton takes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away. \nHAMILTON Take two pulls and pass. \nHamilton passes the blunt to Casper. A bunch of kids start huddling around Casper as he puffs. \nSTEVEN, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks up. \nSTEVEN Yo can I fuck wit dat? \nCasper smiles and blows smoke in his face. \nCASPER Yeah boy! \nCasper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits. \nTwo male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands. \nSteven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke out of his nose. \nSTEVEN Look at that. \nHAROLD That shit is sick. Fuckin faggots. \nCASPER (screaming at the top of his lungs) Fuckin faggots!!! \nEveryone starts laughing. \nCASPER (as loud as possible) Faggots!!! \nCasper rubs his throat. People continue to laugh. \nCASPER My throat. \nHOODLUM Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves. \nCASPER I'm gonna fuck you up bitch. \nThey are both right about to swing. \nEveryone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle. \nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees. \nCasper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can. \nEveryone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck 'em up!\" \nHarold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard. \nHitting him on the legs and stomach. \nCasper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head. \nCASPER (everytime he kicks the guy he says this) Suck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick! \nAll of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over. \nThe hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him. \nThe focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey. \nThis should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy. \nTelly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face. \nCasper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face. \nCASPER Suck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick. \nEveryone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead. \nCasper bends over, right in his face. \nCASPER (smiling) Now get in my way! Bitch. \nCUT TO BLACK \nINT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING \nJennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out the window. Her face looks sad. \nThe TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man. He's wearing a jockey hat and a Hawaiian shirt. He has air fresheners hanging from the mirror. He is chewing on a big wet cigar. He has a half shaved beard. He looks like a dirty old man. \nJennie looks dazed. \nAs the taxi driver drives, he looks in his mirror at Jennie. He pulls his cigar out of his mouth and then puts it back in. \nJazz is playing on the radio. \nTAXI DRIVER Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? \nJennie just shrugs. \nTAXI DRIVER Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest. \nJENNIE What? \nTAXI DRIVER Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe. \nAs the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then looks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls out his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth. \nJENNIE Yeah? \nTAXI DRIVER Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy. \nJENNIE What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart? \nTAXI DRIVER Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, \"Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk\" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier. \nHe starts to laugh. \nA quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really goofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt. \nTAXI DRIVER That's life. \nJennie is smiling. \nJENNIE Your a real philosopher. \nTAXI DRIVER Yeah.

The rides on me. \nJennie has the money up to the glass. \nTAXI DRIVER All right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip. \nHe takes her money. \nJENNIE Thanks. Bye. \nThe taxi driver sticks his head out the window. \nTAXI DRIVER Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining. \nHe points up to the sky before pulling away. \nEXT.

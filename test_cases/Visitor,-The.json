{"test1_input": "CHARLES Hello Walter. \nWALTER Charles. \nCHARLES I'm sorry to interrupt. \nWALTER That's OK. \nCHARLES Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her. \nWALTER Why can't she go? \nCHARLES She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby. \nWalter is caught off guard. \nWALTER When? \nCHARLES Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements. \nWALTER I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles. \nCHARLES I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure. \nWALTER I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book. \nCHARLES You're only teaching one class, Walter. \nWALTER So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now. \nCHARLES I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point. \nWalter is trapped. He comes clean. \nWALTER Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it. \nCHARLES That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument. \nWalter just stares him. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Good bye. \nAnd Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him. \nINT.

Where've you been hiding? \nKaren automatically refills his wine glass. \nWALTER Just busy with work. \nKAREN Well you're never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse. I'm glad your back.

The place is very depressing. There is no privacy. The lights are always on. \nWALTER Do you need anything? \nTAREK No. I just want to get out of here. \nWALTER Zainab and I met with a lawyer today. \nTAREK Yes.

They are caught in awkward moment. Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is the innocent smile of a child. \nSuddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons the Young Girl back inside.

QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER \nWalter is talking to Tarek. \nWALTER But I thought you said you went to the hearing. \nTAREK We did.

And behind that is Ellis Island. \nZainab smiles. \nZAINAB (CONT'D) Sometimes Tarek would point at the statue and jump up and down like we were arriving to New York for the first time.

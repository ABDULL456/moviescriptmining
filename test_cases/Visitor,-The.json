{"train": "THE VISITOR \nWritten by \nTom McCarthy \nINT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nWALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes. \nAfter a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up to the house. \nWalter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens it. \nWOMAN Mr. Vale? \nWALTER Yes. \nWOMAN Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to meet you. \nWALTER Yes. Come in. \nBARBARA Thank you. \nShe steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness. \nWALTER Can I take your coat? \nBARBARA No, thank you. \nWALTER OK. Would you like anything to drink? \nBARBARA No. (Beat) Shall we get started? \nWALTER OK. \nINT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER \nWalter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close proximity. \nBARBARA Let's try it again. \nWALTER The same thing? \nBARBARA Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like a tunnel. \nWALTER OK. \nWalter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress. They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is only a beginner. And not a very good beginner. \nBARBARA Don't flatten. \nWalter keeps playing. \nBARBARA (CONT'D) Make room for the train. \nWalter stops. \nWALTER What? \nBARBARA I said \"make room for the train.\" It's something that I tell my kids. If you curve your fingers like this... (She demonstrates) Then the train can pass through the tunnel. \nShe passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter looks at her for a long moment. \nINT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY \nWalter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then hands Barbara some money. \nWALTER Here. \nBARBARA Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same time? \nWALTER No. I don't think I'm going to continue with our lessons. \nBARBARA Oh, no. Are you giving up? \nWALTER No. \nBarbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the lessons. \nBARBARA Oh. OK. Goodbye. \nCHARLES Hello Walter. \nWALTER Charles. \nCHARLES I'm sorry to interrupt. \nWALTER That's OK. \nCHARLES Walter, Shelley can't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper. I'm going to need you to cover for her. \nWALTER Why can't she go? \nCHARLES She's been put on bed rest until she has the baby. \nWalter is caught off guard. \nWALTER When? \nCHARLES Next week. We'll cover your class and make the arrangements. \nWALTER I wish I could, but now is not a very good time, Charles. \nCHARLES I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure. \nWALTER I just don't think I can with the start of classes and my book. \nCHARLES You're only teaching one class, Walter. \nWALTER So I can stay focused on my writing. I'd really rather not go right now. \nCHARLES I'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this point. \nWalter is trapped. He comes clean. \nWALTER Charles, the truth is this is really Shelley's paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to. I'm not really prepared to present it. \nCHARLES That may be the case but you are the co-author and she can't go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn't advise it. Not with that argument. \nWalter just stares him. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Good bye. \nAnd Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him. \nINT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT \nWalter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar. \nThe wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks down the bar and sets it in front of Walter. \nKAREN Here you go, cutey. \nWALTER Thanks. \nKAREN So I thought you forgot about me. Where've you been hiding? \nKaren automatically refills his wine glass. \nWALTER Just busy with work. \nKAREN Well you're never gonna make it on the wall with that excuse. I'm glad your back. Give a holler if you need anything. I'm just gabbing with one of my girlfriends. \nWALTER OK. \nShe walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat. \nEXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MORNING \nTwo cars are parked in Walter's driveway. \nINT. WALTER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME \nWalter is packing, laying out his shirts on the bed. After a moment, Karen walks in, drying her hair with a towel. \nKAREN When are you going? \nWALTER Today after class. \nShe takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in. \nKAREN Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. You want some coffee? \nWALTER This is my apartment. \nAFRICAN WOMAN What do you mean? This apartment does not belong to you. How did you get in? \nWALTER My name is Walter Vale. I have keys. It's my... \nSuddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard. \nMAN'S VOICE What the fuck?! \nA very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face. He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him. \nYOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Who are you?! Zainab?! \nZAINAB I'm in here! He is crazy! \nWALTER Stop it! I am not... \nThe Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is terrified. \nYOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Shut up! \nWALTER OK. OK. \nZAINAB (O.S.) (In French) Tarek. What is happening? \nTAREK (In French) Are you OK? \nZAINAB (In French) I'm fine. \nTAREK (In French) Who is this? \nZAINAB (In French) I have no idea! I was in the bath and he was just standing there. \nTAREK (Shaking Walter) Did you touch her?! Did you touch her?! \nWALTER No! No! \nZainab opens the door. \nZAINAB (In French) He didn't touch me! But how did he get in? He said he has keys. \nTAREK Do you have keys? \nWALTER Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my apartment. \nTarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it. \nZAINAB (in French) What does he mean it's his apartment? \nTAREK I don't know! Show me your keys! \nWalter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys. \nWALTER This is my apartment. I've owned it for twenty-five years. \nTAREK So why haven't you been here!? \nWALTER I live in Connecticut. I haven't used it in a long time. \nWalter is starting to get through. \nTAREK Are you friends with Ivan? \nWALTER Ivan? Who is Ivan? \nTarek is getting nervous. \nZAINAB (In French) I knew this would happen! He probably called the police. \nThis catches Tarek's attention. \nTAREK (to Walter) Did you call the police? \nWalter hesitates. \nWALTER No. \nTAREK You didn't call the police? \nWALTER No. \nHe sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her. Zainab yells at him. \nWalter watches as they finally collect their belongings and move down the street. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER \nTarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab stands by silently. \nTAREK (In Arabic) Look I know. Come on man, it'll just be for a night or two until we figure something out. OK. \nZAINAB Tarek? \nTAREK (In Arabic) Can you check and call me back? OK. Thanks. \nZAINAB Tarek? \nTAREK What!? \nZainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed photograph. \nWALTER You left this at the apartment. \nTarek walks over and takes it. \nTAREK Thanks. \nWalter nods. \nWALTER Do you know where you're going to stay tonight? \nTAREK Yeah. \nThe lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER \nWalter takes some books out of his briefcase. He crosses to the bookshelf and sets them down. He notices a small stack of CD's sitting on a shelf. He picks one of them up and stares at the CD for a long moment. \nTAREK You like classical music, huh? \nWALTER Yes. \nWalter sets down the CD. \nTAREK Me too. Do you play piano? \nWALTER No. (Beat) Do you? \nTAREK Me? No. I play the djembe. Well, thanks again for letting us stay. You saved me a lot of trouble. \nWalter nods. \nTAREK (CONT'D) See you in the morning. \nWALTER OK. Good night. \nTarek goes to bed. Walter resumes his work. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWalter is lying in bed, unable to sleep. He can hear Tarek and Zainab whispering and laughing. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK AND ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME \nTarek and Zainab are lying in bed together. \nZAINAB Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us. \nTAREK Trust me. He's asleep. \nZAINAB You don't know that. \nTAREK So let him hear. The guy probably needs some excitement. \nZAINAB I think he's probably had enough for one night. \nTarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away. \nZAINAB (CONT'D) Tarek. No! \nZainab sits up in the bed. Tarek relents and rolls onto his back. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks. \nZainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it. \nWALTER Are you sure that you wouldn't like some? \nZAINAB I don't drink. \nTAREK (Jokingly) She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad one. \nWalter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table. \nZAINAB Are you finished? \nWALTER Yes. Thank you. Here, let me... \nZAINAB It's the least I can do. \nHer comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry. \nWALTER Well, thank you for the dinner. It was very good. \nZAINAB You're welcome. \nShe leaves the room. \nTAREK So what's the conference about? \nWALTER Economic Growth in Developing Nations. \nTAREK That's us. (Pointing) Syria. Senegal. \nTAREK (CONT'D) So have you written some books? \nWALTER Three. I'm working on my fourth. \nTAREK Four books?! Great. My father was a writer. A journalist. \nWALTER Is he still writing? \nTAREK No. He died. Before we left Syria. \nWALTER I'm sorry. \nTAREK So am I. \nZainab enters. \nZAINAB Tarek. It's eight-thirty. \nTAREK Oh. We have to go. (To Walter) I have a gig tonight. \nZainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Walter, you can come if you want. \nZainab shoots Tarek a glance. \nWALTER I have to get some work done but thank you. \nTAREK OK. Well maybe another time \nWALTER OK. \nTAREK Bye. \nTarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks around the empty apartment. \nINT.    WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS \nTarek and Zainab are walking down the stairs. \nZAINAB (In French) Why did you invite him? \nTAREK (In French) We're staying in his apartment. What could I do? \nZAINAB (In French) Well I would have been the one stuck sitting with him while you played your drum. \nTarek turns and looks at her very seriously. \nTAREK You know you are very sexy when you're mad at me. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Now take the drum between your legs. Like this. \nTarek grabs the drums with his knees. Walter follows. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Now you want to lift the inside edge off the ground with your ankles. Like this. \nWalter watches Tarek and follows suit. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Great. Feel OK? \nWALTER Yes. \nTAREK OK. Now Walter, I know you're a very smart man but with the drum you have to remember not to think. Thinking just screws it up. OK? \nWALTER OK. \nTAREK Now just give it a couple of bangs. \nWalter gives it a couple of hard bangs. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Not so hard. You're not angry at it. \nWALTER Oh. Right.     Sorry. \nHe bangs it a few more times. \nTAREK Better. Did you think? \nWALTER No. \nTAREK Good. Now one more thing, Walter. You listen to classical music so you think in fours. One. Two. Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This is an African drum. So we are gonna play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You have to forget your classical. Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat. One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow me. \nTarek bangs out a simple bass beat. Walter joins in. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Good. Good ear. Now keep going. \nWalter loses the beat.   Tarek keeps playing. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Don't worry. Start again. \nWalter tries again. And again. And then finally he gets it. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now keep it going and I will do this. \nTarek riffs off of Walter's bass beat. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Yeah. That's it. Keep it going. \nEXT. STREET FAIR - DAY \nZainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye. \nEXT. NEW YORK - STREET \nZainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head and walking past. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER \nZainab enters the apartment and sees Walter drumming. His shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt. He stops. He is breathing very hard and sweating. \nWALTER Hello. \nZAINAB Hello. Where is Tarek? \nShe places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off her coat. She looks around the apartment. \nWALTER He went out. To look at another apartment. \nShe just looks at him with the drum. Walter is still out of breath. \nZAINAB Are you OK? \nWALTER Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry, I'll keep my pants on. \nZainab looks shocked. Walter's attempt at levity has fallen short. \nZAINAB What? \nWALTER Nothing. I was just...nothing. \nZainab nods and walks into the kitchen. \nWalter and Tarek are finishing lunch. Tarek reaches into his bag and takes out a SMALL BAG. \nTAREK Here. This is for you. For letting us stay. \nWALTER Thank you. \nWalter takes it and opens it. It's a CD. \nTAREK It's Fela Kuti. You know him? \nWALTER No. \nTAREK You don't know Fela? Oh, man! Walter, you are in for a treat. He started the whole Afro-Beat movement. And his drummer Tony Allen was just scary, man. You want to play drums, you have to listen to this. \nWALTER OK. I will. \nA HANDSOME ARAB MAN walks past with a PRETTY BLONDE WOMAN. Tarek sees him and waves. \nOMAR (In Arabic) Hey Tarek. How's it going? \nTAREK (in Arabic) Good, Omar. How are you? \nOMAR (In Arabic) Not bad. It's fall in New York, you know? How's the band? \nTAREK (In Arabic) Good. Playing a lot.

Zainab takes it and drops it into a small pouch. \nUPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D) Where are you from? \nZAINAB Senegal. \nUPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters ago. It was just beautiful. \nZAINAB (Handing her the bag) Thank you very much. \nUPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN Thank you. \nThe Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at a nearby stall selling T-shirts. \nZEV How far is Senegal from Cape Town? \nZAINAB Far. \nZEV I told a guy I was from Israel yesterday and he asked if I had ever visited the Holy Land. \nZainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder. \nZEV (CONT'D) Hey, look who it is. What's up Tarek? \nZAINAB Well? \nWALTER They've moved him. \nZAINAB To where? \nWALTER To a detention center in Queens. He was turned over to immigration. They said we can see him during visiting hours tomorrow night from five to ten. \nZainab shakes her head. \nZAINAB I can't visit him or I will end up in that place too. \nZainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks away. Walter watches her go. \nEXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nZainab's bedroom light is on. \nINT.

LAW OFFICE - LATER \nWalter and Zainab talk to an, MR. SHAH, an INDIAN IMMIGRATION LAWYER who is jotting down notes. He is clinical, almost cold in his approach. \nMR. SHAH Zainab, you're also undocumented, right? \nZAINAB Yes. \nMR. SHAH You know you can't visit Tarek at the detention center, right? \nZAINAB Yes. I know. \nMR. SHAH How long have you known Tarek? \nZAINAB Almost a year. \nMR. SHAH Mr. Vale? \nWALTER A week. \nMR. SHAH A week? \nWalter nods. \nMR.

SHAH She's also undocumented, correct? \nZainab hesitates. \nMR. SHAH (CONT'D) It's OK. This is all confidential. \nZAINAB Yes, she is. \nMR. SHAH Does she know that Tarek is in custody? \nZAINAB No. Tarek told me not to tell her. He doesn't want to worry her. \nMR. SHAH Has he ever been convicted of a crime? \nZAINAB No. He has had no trouble. He is a good person. \nMR. SHAH Do you know if they ever applied for asylum? \nWalter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY MACHINE immediately in front of him. \nWalter empties his pockets and steps through. \nWalter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is alone in the small white room until a door on the other side slides open. \nHe steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for lawyer consultations. \nWalter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass is another seat and a phone. \nWalter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES. \nINT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER \nWalter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and smiles. \nThey each move toward the other and settle into a vacant seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down. \nTAREK Walter. Thank you for coming. \nWALTER Of course. \nTAREK How is Zainab? \nWALTER She's upset. I have a letter from her. \nTAREK You can't give it to me. It has to be sent to me by mail. But you can put it up to the glass. \nWalter hesitates. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Go ahead. Open it and place it up to the glass so I can read it. It's OK. It's allowed. \nWalter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter. \nWalter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's phone. Walter picks it up. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Thank you, Walter. \nWalter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back into his coat. \nWALTER How are they treating you? \nTAREK OK. The place is very depressing. There is no privacy. The lights are always on. \nWALTER Do you need anything? \nTAREK No. I just want to get out of here. \nWALTER Zainab and I met with a lawyer today. \nTAREK Yes. What did he say? \nWALTER He is going to stop by to see you tomorrow. \nThey both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally Walter's curiosity gets the best of him. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Tarek, Zainab said you were denied asylum. \nTAREK You mean when we came here? Yeah. \nWALTER Did you go to your deportation hearing? \nTAREK Yeah. \nWALTER You did? \nTAREK Yeah. We did everything they told us to. \nWalter can only nod, unsure of what else to say. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Hey, could you tell Darren? I didn't call him. \nA GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks to him. We can't hear what is being said. \nTAREK (CONT'D) (To Walter) I have to go. They have to do a bed count. Usually, I can visit for one hour. Can you come tomorrow? \nWALTER Yes. \nTAREK Good. And tell Zainab I will call her as soon as I can. \nWalter nods. Tarek gets up. \nTarek shakes his head. \nWALTER Did he say anything else? \nTAREK Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen the case. I don't even understand it. \nWalter nods. \nTAREK (CONT'D) Walter, there are guys who have been in here for years! I can't do that Walter. I'll go crazy. \nWALTER He's trying to deal with the case as quickly as possible. \nTarek goes silent. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Tarek. I have to go back to Connecticut. I'll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything. \nTarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head. \nTAREK OK. Just please...don't forget about me in here. \nWALTER I won't. \nTAREK Are you still practicing? \nWALTER Yes. \nTAREK You should go back to the drum circle. \nWALTER (Quickly) No. \nTarek laughs. \nTAREK OK. But listen to that Fela CD. That will help you, I promise. \nWALTER I will. \nTAREK So show me what you've been working on. \nWALTER What? \nTAREK Show me. On that. Come on. I need some music, man. \nTarek points to the shelf in front of Walter. \nWALTER Now? \nTAREK Don't worry. They can't arrest you. At least not yet. \nWALTER OK. \nWalter looks around and then cradles the phone in his shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top. Tarek watches and listens for a moment. \nTAREK Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You are getting better. \nAnd then he joins in. The two men continue to play together. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING \nWalter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at his door. He exits the room. \nINT.

This is Tarek's apartment. I...share the apartment with him. \nThe Arab Woman is cautious. \nWalter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention Center. \nWALTER That's it. \nMOUNA This is where the prison is? \nWALTER Yes. That's it. \nWalter points to the Detention Center. \nMOUNA It does not look like a prison. \nWALTER I think that's the point. \nMOUNA How many people are in there? \nWALTER Tarek said about three hundred. \nWALTER (CONT'D) There is a coffee shop on that corner. It's not very nice but... \nMOUNA I'll wait there. Here. \nShe takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter. \nMOUNA (CONT'D) Thank you. \nWalter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers, taking in the building. \nINT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER \nWalter is waiting for Tarek. He is watching as a LATIN WOMAN holds her BABY up to the glass as her HUSBAND taps on it from the other side. \nFinally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his. \nTAREK Walter, I thought you were leaving. \nWALTER I was.   Tarek, your mother is here. \nThis stops Tarek cold. \nTAREK What? My mother?! Where? \nWALTER She is waiting outside. \nTAREK When did she arrive? \nWALTER Today. \nTAREK Oh man. Why did she come? She can do nothing for me. \nWALTER She said she hadn't heard from you. \nTAREK Walter. Listen to me. She can not stay here. She doesn't know anyone in New York. I'm sorry but you must get her to go back to Michigan. \nWALTER OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from her. \nWalter takes it out and puts it up to the glass. \nINT. QUEENS, DINER - LATER \nIt's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory workers. Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea. She looks very out of place. \nTwo DETENTION CENTER GUARDS enter and sit down in a booth. Mouna watches them. An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter. He keeps looking at Mouna. \nWAITER Do you need anything else? \nMOUNA No. \nWAITER (In Arabic) Where are you from? \nMOUNA (In Arabic) I am Palestinian from Damascus. \nWAITER (In Arabic) Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt. Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you here? \nMOUNA (In Arabic) I am visiting my son. \nNASIM (In Arabic) He is in detention. \nMOUNA (In Arabic) Yes. \nThe Waiter shakes his head. \nMOUNA You too, Jacob. \nMouna continues up the stairs. Walter follows her. \nJACOB Goodbye, Mr. Vale. \nWALTER Goodbye. \nINT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER \nWalter and Mouna enter the apartment. Mouna picks up her suitcase. \nMOUNA Thank you, Mr. Vale. \nWalter turns. \nWALTER Where are you going? \nMOUNA I will find a hotel. \nWALTER You can stay here. You can use Tarek's room. \nMOUNA Thank you for your offer but I cannot accept this. I don't want to impose on you. \nWALTER You're not imposing. Please. I would like you to stay. \nMOUNA Again, thank you. But I will manage. Goodbye. \nWalter finally steps aside and opens the door. \nMOUNA (CONT'D) Goodbye. \nShe leaves. \nEXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nMouna walks down the stairs. \nWALTER Mrs. Khalil? \nShe turns. Walter is standing at the top of the stairway. \nWALTER (CONT'D) Please. I was with Tarek when he was arrested. He was in the subway in the first place because of me. Please. Stay. Even if it's just for the night. \nWalter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her options. \nINT.

Why? \nWalter is suddenly self-conscious. \nWalter is suddenly self-conscious. \nWALTER I just thought I might spend some more time in New York. \nMOUNA Walter, you do not have to do this for Tarek. \n"}

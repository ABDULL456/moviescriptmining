Do you know what you're getting yourself into?   We're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other.   Do you even know her favorite color? Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly veiled threat. \nMARGARET C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents. \nRICHARD Plum. \nMR. GILBERTSON You mean purple? \nRICHARD No.   Plum is \"smokier\" than purple. \nMR. GILBERTSON Favorite flower? \nRICHARD Tulips.   But only when they're in season. \nMR. GILBERTSON Childhood pet name? \nRICHARD Miss Mittens. \nMARGARET Are we done here? \nMR. GILBERTSON Who knows you're getting married? Margaret interrupts. \nMARGARET No one.   With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew. \nMR. GILBERTSON Have you at least told your family? \nMARGARET \n(EXCITED) My parents are dead! \nMR. GILBERTSON How convenient.   So you're not telling anyone that you are getting married? \nRICHARD Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad. \nMR. GILBERTSON Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got enough to send you to prison... \nMARGARET We're telling his family this weekend. \nRICHARD We are? \nMARGARET Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them... (trying to remember) ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party. \nMR. GILBERTSON And where's that going to be? \nMARGARET (no idea) At Richard's parent's house. \nMR. GILBERTSON And where's that located? \nMARGARET (still no idea) In his hometown. \nRICHARD Sitka. \nMR. GILBERTSON Is that on Long Island? Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover. \nMARGARET Why don't you tell him? \nRICHARD Alaska. \nMR. GILBERTSON You're going to Alaska this weekend? \nMARGARET (Alaska???) Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up. \nMR. GILBERTSON You think you can beat me with this B-S story?   Forcing your secretary... \nRICHARD Assistant. \nMR.

GILBERTSON The INS will see you both in ten days for your official interview.   Your stories better match up on every account. Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her the piece of paper. MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd) Cross all your T's and dot your I's with this ruse, Ms. Mills. \nMARGARET There are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work. MARGARET (cont'd) Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice. MARGARET (cont'd) So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face. MARGARET (cont'd) But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move. MARGARET (cont'd) Hello?   Richard?   Richard! Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left. \nRICHARD I quit. Richard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand. \nINT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS \nRichard powers through the office.   Co-workers take notice that Margaret is following him. \nMARGARET Richard, come back here. Margaret tries not to make a scene. MARGARET (cont'd) Richard.   Richard. Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception. MARGARET (cont'd) Come back to the office! Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face. \nRICHARD You shut up.   You just lost your \"I get to tell Richard what to do\" privileges. \nMARGARET Well, we need to talk. \nRICHARD You want to talk with me?   Fine.   Grab your broom and let's go. Margaret is dumbstruck.   The receptionist is shocked.   The elevator arrives and Richard gets in.   Margaret follows. As the doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist. RICHARD (cont'd) Watch my phones! \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nRichard and Margaret walk in silence through the park.   Richard finally speaks. \nRICHARD Your plan is psychotic. \nMARGARET Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time.   Sometimes you need to sack up. \nRICHARD Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice? \nMARGARET You wanna be an editor?   You need to make \nRICHARD OK.   Fine.   Then if we \"make this happen\"? You're promoting me to editor. \nMARGARET I'm doing what? \nRICHARD We go to Alaska and lie to my family?   I risk going to jail?   Well, you're making me editor for that.   I mean, did you think I'd do this out of the kindness of my heart? \nMARGARET You work for me! \nRICHARD You know, during my employee orientation, the HR rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you. \nMARGARET Look, I came to this town alone and with nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No way. \nRICHARD Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that sounds like your problem.   Not mine. Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand. \nMARGARET Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend, and I'll make you editor.   Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it. MARGARET (cont'd) And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even have hotels in Alaska? \nRICHARD No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really. And you have to poop in a bucket.   But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.   But with bears. \nEXT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY \nA commercial jet TAKES OFF and leaves New York City behind. \nINT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY \nRichard and Margaret sit in First Class and work on their lap tops.   Richard looks up. \nRICHARD Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents? Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question. \nMARGARET Are you done with the press release? \nRICHARD Almost. \nMARGARET \n(PATRONIZING) Well let's finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk.   Okay? Dejected, Richard goes back to work. \n", "test1_id": 2757, "test2_input": "RICHARD Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there. You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual harassment. \nRichard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his neck.   He gently puts him outside their room. RICHARD (cont'd) There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before she makes a coat out of you. Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without looking back, Richard gets the final shot. RICHARD (cont'd) Puppy hater. \nLATER Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find to create himself makeshift bed on the floor. Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed. \nMARGARET I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black. MARGARET (cont'd) Oh.   Well.   Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling. \nRICHARD It was kinda weird seeing you naked. \nMARGARET Can we not talk about this? \nRICHARD I'm just saying.   It was weird. \nMARGARET It wasn't weird. \nRICHARD How was that not weird? \nMARGARET Because we're... like teammates. \nRICHARD We're like teammates? \nMARGARET We are teammates.   And teammates see each other naked in the locker room.   All the time.   It's not a big deal. \nRICHARD Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the bed? \nMARGARET Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat. \nRICHARD Margaret? \nMARGARET Yes? \nRICHARD Don't take this the wrong way. \nMARGARET Okay... \nRICHARD You're a very beautiful woman. Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard. \nMARGARET Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow. \nINT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY \nNot a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code on a piece of paper.   He dials. \nGEOFFREY Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey Paxton... Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the rest of the conversation. \nINT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY \nMargaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long, before there is a KNOCK on the door. \nMARGARET Who is it? \nDEBBIE (O.S.) It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in bed.   Can I come in? \nMARGARET \n(STALLING) Uh, sure.   Just a second. Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head. \nRICHARD What the... \nMARGARET \n(MOUTHING) Your mother. Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts his arm around Margaret. \nRICHARD Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee. RICHARD (cont'd) Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls. \nDEBBIE Well, it's your special day. Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement. DEBBIE (cont'd) You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then your wedding. \n", "test2_true": "DEBBIE Will you pick up some champagne while you're there? \nRICHARD No problem. \nDEBBIE And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of work to be done! \nMARGARET You don't have to go to all this trouble. Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret. \nDEBBIE Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of your life.   You are coming into this family, and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If your parents were with us, they would do the exact same. Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard jumps out of bed and goes to the food. \nMARGARET \n(TOUCHED) Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had someone make me breakfast in bed since I was a little kid. Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll. \nRICHARD (mouth full) I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught us.   Damn, that was close. Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay attention to Margaret. \nMARGARET You just take all this for granted?   Your family, this house... Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret. \nRICHARD (mouth full) I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these. Margaret looks at Richard with disgust. \nMARGARET Why are you doing this to them? \nRICHARD Huh? \nMARGARET Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me here. \nRICHARD You made me bring you here!   You told me I \nMARGARET I didn't make you do anything.   You could of said no. \nRICHARD And what?   Start over at the bottom again? No way. \nMARGARET I get why a not rich person would do this. But you've got everything.   It doesn't make any sense. \nRICHARD Know what?   This is none of your business. \nMARGARET I wish it wasn't my business.   But unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated. \nRICHARD You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show you why you're here. \nMARGARET Fine. \nRICHARD We leave in a half hour. \nMARGARET I'll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls. MARGARET (cont'd) These are really good. She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves. \nEXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY \nRichard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes and running shoes. \nEXT. BOAT - DAY \nRichard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself. \nEXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY \nRichard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be processed.   Everything is clean and organized. Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute. Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse. \nBEK BEK Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady? \nRICHARD Yes sir, it is! \nBEK BEK (to Margaret) You look much younger than everyone says. \nMARGARET That's great to hear. \nRICHARD See ya on the line, Bek Bek. \n", "test2_id": 2758, "test3_input": "INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nRichard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what. \nRICHARD Put this on.   I'll meet you outside. \nMARGARET But I don't... \nRICHARD Ah.   Put it on. \nEXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nMargaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing boots, and gloves. \nMARGARET Is this really necessary? \nRICHARD You'll thank me later. Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her \nINT. SLIME LINE - DAY \nInside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different stations process the fish that come off the boats. At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves when he sees Margaret and Richard. \nMARGARET Why is he handcuffed to the machine? \nRICHARD So his hands don't go too far.   So he doesn't... Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces. \nMARGARET Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out. MARGARET (cont'd) You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines. \nWORKER There he is!   Big city boy come to show us how its done. \nRICHARD Ah, it's been a while. \nWORKER C'mon.   Show her how we do it. \nRICHARD Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife. RICHARD (cont'd) You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine. \nMargaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort. RICHARD (cont'd) Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein.   Then send her down the line. Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before offering a knife to Margaret. RICHARD (cont'd) Wanna try it? Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch. RICHARD (cont'd) If it's too gross for you... \nMARGARET Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon. \nRICHARD I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before I took over. \nMARGARET Is that why you're still pissed at him? \nRICHARD Nah, I loved it here. \nMARGARET (re: fish guts) You loved this? \nRICHARD The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the slime line.   I loved this place.   The people.   Growing up, running this place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish. \nMARGARET \n(DISGUSTED) You wanted this? \nRICHARD I wanted to run this place. It was comfortable here.   It was what I knew. (re: fish) Don't forget the spine. \nMARGARET I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence. \nRICHARD But then things changed.   And it wasn't so comfortable anymore. \nMARGARET What kind of things changed? \nRICHARD Stuff. \nMARGARET (as if she didn't know) You mean, like, Gertrude? \nRICHARD Yeah... Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something. RICHARD (cont'd) Oh my god.   She told you didn't she? \n", "test3_true": "(INNOCENT) Told me what? Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away. \nRICHARD About the... you know. \nMARGARET The creepy teenage proposal? \nRICHARD Ah, shit! \nMARGARET You were a freak by the way. \nRICHARD OK, get it all out. \nMARGARET And she was right to break up with you. \nRICHARD You done? Margaret nods yes. \nRICHARD (cont'd) I know now that it was the right thing, but it screwed me up for a little while. \nMARGARET For a little while?   Don't sell yourself short. \nRICHARD When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore. \nMARGARET So you moved to the open arms of New York City? \nRICHARD At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then I fell in love with it. \nMARGARET With scheduling my pilates? \nRICHARD With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd always read a lot, but until I worked for you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I realized that we could find the next Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or... \nMARGARET (with reverence) ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird. \nRICHARD Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that? Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job. RICHARD (cont'd) So when I tell my folks that I want to spend my life finding books?   My dad goes ape shit.                                                             \"How dare you forsake your family... you'll come crawling back to us... you're nothing without our help.\"   I left that night and we didn't talk for a year. Haven't been back here since. \nMARGARET So we're \"getting married\" so you can give daddy the finger? \nRICHARD No. Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look. RICHARD (cont'd) Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with you...   I get the promotion and I get to show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make a good prop. \nMARGARET \n(SMILING) I guess that's a compliment. \nRICHARD So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I trustworthy again? \nMARGARET Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're more screwed up than I am, Paxton. \nRICHARD Yeah.   Thanks. \nMARGARET One more question... \nRICHARD Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian. \nMARGARET That wasn't my question. \nRICHARD I know.   Just lashing out. Margaret smiles. \nMARGARET Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone. \nINT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY \nRichard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store, filled with food, booze and electronics.   A mini Wal Mart. \nRICHARD Hey Ramone. \nRAMONE Hey Richard.

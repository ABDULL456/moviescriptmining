{"train": "THE PROPOSAL \nWritten by \nPete Chiarelli \nJune 16, 2006 \nFADE IN: \nINT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nThe sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't watching. As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP, THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching \"The O.C.\" on Tivo, and reading a manuscript. She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she hits a button to stop the treadmill... \nINT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nA hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same model on the walls. Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is 6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over. \nRICHARD Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the model on the walls and is really, really hot. \nSIMONE In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you some coffee? \nRICHARD Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late. Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds his pants on the floor and puts them on. RICHARD (cont'd) Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard. \nSIMONE In here. She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half dressed.   He swallows a little throwup. \nRICHARD Baby, I just can't do this anymore. \nINT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nMargaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves off. \nINT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nReflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly gets dressed as he talks. \nRICHARD You're just too much for me.   And I'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job. \nSIMONE Fine.   Whatever.   Just go. Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone. \nRICHARD Let's not end it like that. It's been an amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you. And you should know that you have the nicest ass I've ever been with. \nSIMONE \n(TOUCHED) You mean it? \nRICHARD I do.   It's magnificent. \nSIMONE I work really hard on it. \nRICHARD I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body.   Richard shakes his head \"no\" and smiles. RICHARD (cont'd) I really gotta go. \nINT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING \nCRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher. Her apartment is very quiet. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING \nHONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch. \nINT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING \nDING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at her phone as she lets it ring. \nMARGARET (to phone) I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me what I want to hear.   Give it to me. \nDOORMAN You have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you. \nMargaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other. Her office looks perfect. \nRICHARD You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. \nMARGARET Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight, \n(MORE) \nMARGARET (cont'd) (big news) I got Frank to do publicity. \nRICHARD Nice job. \nMARGARET When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here? \nRICHARD I'm sure.   You want him on the phone? \nMARGARET We're going to his office.   Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office... \nINT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS \n... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer and sends an instant message to the office \"The Banshee is headed to Bob's office.\" \nINT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING \nAs the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes their imaginary conversations. \nINT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING \nMargaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the hearts that dot the \"I's\" in Jillian. \nMARGARET That's cute.   You gonna call her today? \nRICHARD What? Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed. \nMARGARET Are you bored here?   Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day? \nRICHARD Uh... \nMARGARET You have another late night out? \nRICHARD \nMargaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried because he doesn't know where she's going with this. \nMARGARET I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday. \nRICHARD Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long. \nMARGARET You'll magically unwrinkle? \nRICHARD Yes. \nMARGARET You have magic pants? \nRICHARD No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles. \nMARGARET Does this work on more than just your pants? \nRICHARD Anything that's wrinkled. \nMARGARET Buy me some. \nRICHARD Will do. Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point. \nMARGARET I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work.   If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it? \nRICHARD Got it. \nMR. GILBERTSON If I prove you're lying, you go to federal prison for five years. Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes. MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd) (to Richard) You.   Do you know what you're getting yourself into?   We're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other.   Do you even know her favorite color? Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly veiled threat. \nMARGARET C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents. \nRICHARD Plum. \nMR. GILBERTSON You mean purple? \nRICHARD No.   Plum is \"smokier\" than purple. \nMR. GILBERTSON Favorite flower? \nRICHARD Tulips.   But only when they're in season. \nMR. GILBERTSON Childhood pet name? \nRICHARD Miss Mittens. \nMARGARET Are we done here? \nMR. GILBERTSON Who knows you're getting married? Margaret interrupts. \nMARGARET No one.   With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew. \nMR. GILBERTSON Have you at least told your family? \nMARGARET \n(EXCITED) My parents are dead! \nMR. GILBERTSON How convenient.   So you're not telling anyone that you are getting married? \nRICHARD Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad. \nMR. GILBERTSON Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got enough to send you to prison... \nMARGARET We're telling his family this weekend. \nRICHARD We are? \nMARGARET Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them... (trying to remember) ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party. \nMR. GILBERTSON And where's that going to be? \nMARGARET (no idea) At Richard's parent's house. \nMR. GILBERTSON And where's that located? \nMARGARET (still no idea) In his hometown. \nRICHARD Sitka. \nMR. GILBERTSON Is that on Long Island? Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover. \nMARGARET Why don't you tell him? \nRICHARD Alaska. \nMR. GILBERTSON You're going to Alaska this weekend? \nMARGARET (Alaska???) Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up. \nMR. GILBERTSON You think you can beat me with this B-S story?   Forcing your secretary... \nRICHARD Assistant. \nMR. GILBERTSON ...assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend? \nINT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY \nAs they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and talks on the phone.   Still the assistant, Richard lags behind, weighed down by both their bags. Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone. \nMARGARET So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet points. \nRICHARD I told \u00e2\u0080\u0098em we've been dating for six months. We've kept it a secret from everyone... (under his breath) ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate. Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor. \nMARGARET \n(VENOMOUS) Don't make me hate you. Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes through.   The attendant gives Richard a look. \nRICHARD Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's \nTangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass. The impatient attendant is getting frustrated. RICHARD (cont'd) I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a little flustered too.   Haven't been home for awhile, hope they like her! The gate attendant smiles. \nGATE ATTENDANT (heard it all) I don't care, sir. Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over. \nRICHARD OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks. Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors. \nINT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY \nMargaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME MAN who is READING A BOOK.   She notices the title and he catches her stare.   Margaret explains. \nMARGARET I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on that book. \nHANDSOME MAN You wrote it? \nMARGARET Edited it.   It was one of my favorites. \nHANDSOME MAN Well you did a good job.   It's great. \nMARGARET You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines? \nHANDSOME MAN My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a lot for work.   I'll read anything... \nMARGARET \n(SUSPICIOUS) Ex-girlfriend, huh? \nHANDSOME MAN (smiling, embarrassed) OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But let's keep that between us. Margaret smiles and makes the \"my lips are sealed\" motion.   Just then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags. \nMARGARET There you are.   Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag. \nRICHARD (re: book) Hey, he's reading... \nMARGARET I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret. \nHANDSOME MAN Did you two want to sit together? \nMARGARET Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard. \nHANDSOME MAN Your boyfriend? Margaret points to Richard indignantly. \nMARGARET You mean him? The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record straight. MARGARET (cont'd) No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant. \nHANDSOME MAN You're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska? Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer. \nRICHARD Oh, you can tell him the truth. \nMARGARET Well, he's... indispensable. \nThe Handsome man isn't buying it. MARGARET (cont'd) And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go. Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along. \nRICHARD That's me. Richard turns to close the overhead compartment. \nHANDSOME MAN You're awfully nice to fly him first class. Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard. \nMARGARET Surprise?   Another surprise? \nRICHARD She's not good with surprises. \nMARGARET I'm really not good with surprises. \nEXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nDebbie stops.   Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone. Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other. \nDEBBIE Well you two... \nGRANDMA ANNIE ...you're getting married this weekend! \nMARGARET                                                           RICHARD What?                                                              What? GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd) The whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says \"what are you talking about?\" \nDEBBIE When Gilber-something told us you were getting married... \nGRANDMA ANNIE \nDEBBIE ...God rest their souls... \nGRANDMA ANNIE ...or friends... \nDEBBIE ...we decided to give you a wedding. \nGRANDMA ANNIE Engagement party tonight... \nDEBBIE ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight. Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks. \nMARGARET Are you witches? \nGRANDMA ANNIE Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good luck.   It's an Alaskan thing. \nDEBBIE We've planned everything. Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher. \nGRANDMA ANNIE I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time left.   Richard lives so far away, and I never see him.   Now I find out he's getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up. The crowd cheers. \nEXT. SITKA - DAY \nA procession of cars makes its way through town. \nINT. PICKUP - DAY \nDebbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles. Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible in the backseat of the extended cab. \nMargaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives Margaret a \"what did you do that for\" look. \nMARGARET \n(MOUTHING) The Dragon Lady!? Richard shrugs. \nGRANDMA ANNIE To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday.   Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at Richard. \nMARGARET I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile. \nEXT. DOCK - DAY \nThe cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the ocean.   Margaret is confused. \nMARGARET I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going. \nRICHARD Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise. Richard points to a small island about a mile away. \nEXT. YACHT - DAY \nEveryone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene. \nDEBBIE I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her old self. \nMARGARET I'm about 15 seconds from bitch. \nRICHARD Calm down. \nMARGARET What is going on here? \nRICHARD Hell if I know. \nMARGARET You had no idea they knew about us getting married? \nRICHARD You think I'd bring you here if I did? \nMARGARET Well, we just gotta tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. \nRICHARD Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em what? \nMARGARET Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em the truth.   About us. \nRICHARD Wrong answer.   No way. \nMARGARET What do you mean no way?   This is crazy. \nRICHARD No, crazy was lying to the federal officer. \nMARGARET Well I don't like this. \nRICHARD Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony!   For one second could you not be so selfish? \nMARGARET Selfish? \nRICHARD Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day? \nMARGARET How is it selfish to tell the truth? \nRICHARD Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone.   We need to protect the people downstairs.   We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind. \nMARGARET Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me. \nRICHARD What've I lied to you about? \nMARGARET Why did you tell me that you were poor? \nRICHARD I never said that. \nMARGARET Well, you never told me you were rich. \nRICHARD When does that come up? \nMARGARET I don't know, how about, \"Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry.\" \nRICHARD Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew. \nMARGARET No I wouldn't. \nRICHARD Come on!   You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti- rich. \nMARGARET I'm not anti-rich. \nRICHARD Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it worse?   You have money! \nMARGARET I earned... \nRICHARD ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah. You need new material. \nMARGARET Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant. \nGERTRUDE I moved back about six months ago.   I'm teaching second grade.   At Baranof. \nRICHARD Did your husband move up here too? \nGERTRUDE Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced. \nRICHARD Oh my God.   I'm sorry. \nGERTRUDE Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret. \nGERTRUDE (cont'd) Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert. \nMARGARET You're a Gertrude? \nGERTRUDE A family name from hell. \nMARGARET I'm sure it's been a curse. \nGEOFFREY Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence. \nGERTRUDE Oh Please.   Ancient history. \nGEOFFREY Feels like yesterday to me. \nGERTRUDE (ignoring Geoffrey) So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight? \nMARGARET Not exactly... \nGRANDMA ANNIE Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a story like this. \nRICHARD Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. RICHARD (cont'd) Uh, uh, um, I... \nGEOFFREY Yeah.   How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly. Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in. \nMARGARET Can I tell this one, honey? \nRICHARD Uh.   Sure. \nMARGARET I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday.   Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, \"shhhh.\"   So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?\" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET (cont'd) I said yes. The group gives a collective \"ahh\".   Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand. \nGRANDMA ANNIE You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud.   I love you Richy. \nRICHARD I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude. \nGEOFFREY So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around? \nDEBBIE What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret. Margaret doesn't miss a beat. \nMARGARET Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so embarrassed. \nDEBBIE Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass. While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says \"I've got this under control\".   The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear. \nRICHARD Margaret Mill's phone. (off answer) One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. RICHARD (cont'd) It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem. \nMARGARET Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside. \nEXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nMargaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him. \nMARGARET Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear. MARGARET (cont'd) (to Balzac) Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear. \nMARGARET (cont'd) I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind.   Our job is to help you succeed.   He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass. She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off.   Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone. MARGARET (cont'd) Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened. Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up. MARGARET (cont'd) \n(NONCHALANT) Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house. MARGARET (cont'd) Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this.   This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.   She runs. MARGARET (cont'd) ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is- always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks. MARGARET (cont'd) \nPanicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering. MARGARET (cont'd) Take the dog!   Take the dog! \nMARGARET Want me to do it? \nGRANDMA ANNIE Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY \nSnow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid formations at every hitting area. Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls. \nGEOFFREY ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water. \nMAGUIRE How does she come up with this shit? \nGEOFFREY She just does.   I stopped trying to figure out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr. Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is. \nMAGUIRE \n(JOKING) I'm mad at you, son! \nRICHARD Why's that, Mr. Maguire? \nMAGUIRE You fly up here and don't call me? \nRICHARD Sorry \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout that. \nMAGUIRE What good is me owning an airline if I can't give you free tickets? \nRICHARD You're right.   Don't know what I was thinking... \nMAGUIRE Damn, straight.   Don't let it happen again! (hands Richard a golf club) Here, you take over.   This game is for pussies, I'm getting a drink. Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk. \nGEOFFREY Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's, uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going. \nRICHARD That's great for them. \nGEOFFREY So.   How's work with you? \nRICHARD Good.   Busy.   You know. \nGEOFFREY I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan? \nRICHARD Congratulations. \nGEOFFREY We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore.   We're going global. \nRICHARD Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been thinking about this moment for a long time. \nGEOFFREY I could really use your help. \nRICHARD Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's in New York.   We have jobs. \nGEOFFREY I know.   I know.   It's just... \nRICHARD \n(CHALLENGING) It's just what? \nGEOFFREY You're only a secretary. This pisses Richard off immediately. \nRICHARD Again with the secretary thing!   I've told you, I'm an assistant! \nGEOFFREY Just because you call yourself an \"assistant\" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary. \nRICHARD Well if I'm \"just a secretary\", why would you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like you're doing great without me. \nGEOFFREY It's not like that and you know it. \nRICHARD Then how is it?   Explain it to me. Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening. \nGERTRUDE What do you mean? \nMARGARET Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused. MARGARET (cont'd) I mean he was a total player.   Before we started dating.   Six months ago. \nGERTRUDE \nMARGARET That surprises you? \nGERTRUDE Did he ever tell you why we broke up? \nMARGARET We don't really talk much about stuff like that. \nGERTRUDE Oh.   Well I should shut up... \nMARGARET No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting married.   I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed. \nGERTRUDE He proposed to me.   When we were seniors. Margaret laughs. \nMARGARET I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed to you in high school? \nGERTRUDE He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee.   It was so cute. \nMARGARET You must have... \nGERTRUDE ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up with him on the spot. \nMARGARET I would hope so. \nGERTRUDE After getting rejected the first time, I can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you. Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Anyway.   The idea that my little old man could be a player...   It's just not the Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an honest man of him again. \nGertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls. \nMARGARET I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers. MARGARET (cont'd) We are awful people. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY \nTHWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world. Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht. Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's mood deflates when she sees Richard. \nDEBBIE \n(SHOUTING) Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK? With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear or see the girls. Annie shakes her head.   Something is up. \nINT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nGeoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the door, not sure what is going on. \nGEOFFREY Excuse me?   I'm watching that. \nANNIE Why is Richard chopping wood? \nDEBBIE And don't play dumb.   What did you do? Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret. \nGEOFFREY Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you please move. The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself. \nMARGARET I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad. Margaret just smiles. MARGARET (cont'd) Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He looks genuinely unnerved. \nGEOFFREY Stop looking at me like that! \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY \nRichard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks. \nINT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY \nMargaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower. \nINT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nRICHARD Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there. You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual harassment. \nRichard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his neck.   He gently puts him outside their room. RICHARD (cont'd) There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before she makes a coat out of you. Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without looking back, Richard gets the final shot. RICHARD (cont'd) Puppy hater. \nLATER Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find to create himself makeshift bed on the floor. Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed. \nMARGARET I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black. MARGARET (cont'd) Oh.   Well.   Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling. \nRICHARD It was kinda weird seeing you naked. \nMARGARET Can we not talk about this? \nRICHARD I'm just saying.   It was weird. \nMARGARET It wasn't weird. \nRICHARD How was that not weird? \nMARGARET Because we're... like teammates. \nRICHARD We're like teammates? \nMARGARET We are teammates.   And teammates see each other naked in the locker room.   All the time.   It's not a big deal. \nRICHARD Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the bed? \nMARGARET Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat. \nRICHARD Margaret? \nMARGARET Yes? \nRICHARD Don't take this the wrong way. \nMARGARET Okay... \nRICHARD You're a very beautiful woman. Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard. \nMARGARET Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow. \nINT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY \nNot a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code on a piece of paper.   He dials. \nGEOFFREY Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey Paxton... Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the rest of the conversation. \nINT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY \nMargaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long, before there is a KNOCK on the door. \nMARGARET Who is it? \nDEBBIE (O.S.) It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in bed.   Can I come in? \nMARGARET \n(STALLING) Uh, sure.   Just a second. Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head. \nRICHARD What the... \nMARGARET \n(MOUTHING) Your mother. Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts his arm around Margaret. \nRICHARD Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee. RICHARD (cont'd) Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls. \nDEBBIE Well, it's your special day. Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement. DEBBIE (cont'd) You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then your wedding. \nINT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nRichard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what. \nRICHARD Put this on.   I'll meet you outside. \nMARGARET But I don't... \nRICHARD Ah.   Put it on. \nEXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY \nMargaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing boots, and gloves. \nMARGARET Is this really necessary? \nRICHARD You'll thank me later. Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her \nINT. SLIME LINE - DAY \nInside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different stations process the fish that come off the boats. At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves when he sees Margaret and Richard. \nMARGARET Why is he handcuffed to the machine? \nRICHARD So his hands don't go too far.   So he doesn't... Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces. \nMARGARET Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out. MARGARET (cont'd) You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines. \nWORKER There he is!   Big city boy come to show us how its done. \nRICHARD Ah, it's been a while. \nWORKER C'mon.   Show her how we do it. \nRICHARD Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife. RICHARD (cont'd) You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine. \nMargaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort. RICHARD (cont'd) Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein.   Then send her down the line. Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before offering a knife to Margaret. RICHARD (cont'd) Wanna try it? Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch. RICHARD (cont'd) If it's too gross for you... \nMARGARET Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon. \nRICHARD I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before I took over. \nMARGARET Is that why you're still pissed at him? \nRICHARD Nah, I loved it here. \nMARGARET (re: fish guts) You loved this? \nRICHARD The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the slime line.   I loved this place.   The people.   Growing up, running this place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish. \nMARGARET \n(DISGUSTED) You wanted this? \nRICHARD I wanted to run this place. It was comfortable here.   It was what I knew. (re: fish) Don't forget the spine. \nMARGARET I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence. \nRICHARD But then things changed.   And it wasn't so comfortable anymore. \nMARGARET What kind of things changed? \nRICHARD Stuff. \nMARGARET (as if she didn't know) You mean, like, Gertrude? \nRICHARD Yeah... Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something. RICHARD (cont'd) Oh my god.   She told you didn't she? \n(EMBARRASSED) Hey. They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word. MARGARET (cont'd) You know him? \nRICHARD He was my shop teacher. \nMARGARET Of course he was.   How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne. \nRICHARD Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of the year. \nMARGARET Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout. \nRICHARD (to Ramone) You got the phone I called about? \nRAMONE Charged up, ready to go, number changed. Ramone throws Richard a phone. \nRICHARD Thanks, Ramone. \nRAMONE No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back. Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay. Margaret is confused. \nEXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nRichard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up. \nMARGARET Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff? \nRICHARD It's our stuff. \nRichard points to the \"Paxton General Store\" sign. \nMARGARET That must have been handy in High School. \nRICHARD You have no idea. \nMARGARET Should you leave the cart? \nRICHARD It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such a prude. \nMARGARET I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me. \nRICHARD I doubt it.   When I started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things. \nMARGARET (deadly serious) I told you never to talk about that. \nRICHARD I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal. \nMARGARET (up to the challenge) Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade? \nRICHARD Where? \nMARGARET The Y. \nRICHARD Margaret 1, Richard 0. \nMARGARET Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang. \nRICHARD At Woodstock? \nMARGARET I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair. \nRICHARD What'd they sing again? \nMARGARET You know. \n(SINGING) Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live... Richard shakes his head. MARGARET (cont'd) Well they were good. \nRICHARD You had a lot of soul there, Canada. \nMARGARET I really like \"The O.C.\".   Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really like it. \nINT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALL - DAY \nRichard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school. \nMRS. WHITING Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work to do. \nRICHARD She'll be out of there in two shakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of second graders.   He stops transfixed. \nMRS. WHITING (re: Gertrude) We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of the school year.   He's living out in the forest now with his wolves.   Full time. Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and they hang on her every word. MRS. WHITING (cont'd) Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to ring, I need to get ready for recess. \nRICHARD (not paying attention) Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in. \nINSIDE THE CLASSROOM The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door. \nGERTRUDE Class, this is my old friend Richard. \nCLASS (all together) Hi Richard! \nGERTRUDE Richard and I used to be in this very same classroom together.   We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher. \nCHILD #1 Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs! The class giggles. \nGERTRUDE That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick. The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Marcia? \nCHILD #2 Sorry. The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat. \nGERTRUDE OK, everyone is excused for recess. All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude. \nRICHARD Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs. \nGERTRUDE It's still not a nice thing to say.   And actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and... (makes smoking pot motion) ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep that between us. \nINT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY \nMargaret reads over her e-mail to Frank. \nMARGARET \n(READING) I give you my word as an editor and a friend... The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS. MARGARET (cont'd) \n(STERN) Five more minutes!   Please! \nMargaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway. Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to apologize, but needs to keep working. MARGARET (cont'd) \n(WEAKLY) Sorry. \nINT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY \nGertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together.   They are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport. \nRICHARD Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this after school for a week? \nGERTRUDE That was your fault. \nRICHARD Was not! \nGERTRUDE You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend herself. \nRICHARD C'mon! (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun) I had the shot.   I took it. Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times. \nGERTRUDE No Top Gun.   Please. \nRICHARD What?   You loved my Top Gun. \nGERTRUDE No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend. \nRICHARD That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous. Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Gertrude is not impressed. \nRichard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking about Gertrude and wanting to be alone. \nMARGARET So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies. \nRICHARD Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head. \nMARGARET That was it?   I was gone for awhile... \nRICHARD (cuts her off) Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do this.   You should really go try on the dress for my mom. \nMARGARET I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy. \nRICHARD (could care less) Whatever. Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but doesn't push it. \nEXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY \nMargaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop. \nMARGARET What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old. \nSHAMAN Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance. He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs. Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again. SHAMAN (cont'd) Margaret, welcome! She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity. SHAMAN (cont'd) Come to me, Margaret of New York. Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing. SHAMAN (cont'd) It is I, father Paxton. Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up. \nMARGARET What, ah, are you doing? \nGEOFFREY My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head.   As you know, things have been a little crazy around here.   You should join me. \nMARGARET Ya know, I've got to get back. \nGEOFFREY You closed minded southerners amuse me. Never willing to leave the nest and try \nMARGARET I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher. \nGEOFFREY Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle. Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents. \nMARGARET OK, OK.   I \"accept your circle.\" Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire. \nGEOFFREY Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After a few moments, Margaret stops. \nMARGARET I'm gonna head back. \nGEOFFREY We're not done. \nMARGARET I think I am. Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her. \nGEOFFREY Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around. GEOFFREY (cont'd) I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Thank you. (switching gears) Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k... Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still painfully awkward. \nGEOFFREY (cont'd) ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Geoffrey speeds up the dance. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Now you. \nMARGARET Me what? \nGEOFFREY Chant. \nMARGARET Chant what? \nGEOFFREY Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the way.   You'll feel better. \nMARGARET I can't... \nGEOFFREY Close your eyes.   Chant. Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes, but can't figure out what to say. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Chant! \nMARGARET I don't know any chants! \nGEOFFREY Chant! \nMARGARET \n(GUTTERAL) Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low noise. MARGARET (cont'd) ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... \nGRANDMA ANNIE Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk. GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd) We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY \nRichard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic. \nMARGARET We need to talk. \nRICHARD I'm a little busy. \nMARGARET Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away from here.   From everyone.   Now. \nRICHARD Go for another run. \nMARGARET No!   I did that.   It did not help. \nRICHARD I'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping... \nMARGARET (re: wedding stuff) We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here. \nRICHARD OK, high maintenance.   Let's go. \nEXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY \nUnlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and maneuverability. Richard starts her up. \nMARGARET Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel. \nRICHARD You don't know where we're going. Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off. \nMARGARET It doesn't matter. \nON THE OPEN OCEAN Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the horizon. \nAs they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees, blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it doesn't take long to leave humanity behind. Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an icy beach can be seen straight ahead. MARGARET (cont'd) Where are we? \nRICHARD The north pole.   Congratulations, we made it. (off Margaret's look) It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better let me take it from here. \nMARGARET I'm fine. \nRICHARD Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields?   And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer. RICHARD (cont'd) Lady, you've got issues. \nMARGARET Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine. \nRICHARD It doesn't stop there. \nMARGARET This coming from the sociopath. \nRICHARD Oh, please. \nMARGARET I'd never bring me here. \nRICHARD You drove! \nMARGARET I mean to Alaska. \nRICHARD Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine. \nMARGARET You're sick.   Doing this to them. \nRICHARD I explained to you... \nMARGARET They love you.   Do you get that? \nRICHARD Of course. \nMARGARET And you're still willing to lie to them? \nMARGARET Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way. \nRICHARD So, I'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out.   OK? \nMARGARET I'm really cold. \nRICHARD Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice. \nMARGARET (makes sense) \nOK. Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to his knee.   He calmly looks down on her. \nRICHARD So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits. I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't freak out. Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word. RICHARD (cont'd) When I get you all the way out, I need you to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you over there. Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her \"over the threshold\" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks once they're safe. \nRICHARD (cont'd) I've, uh, never done that before. \nMARGARET You said it was \"no biggie\". \nRICHARD Yeah.   Well.   You OK? \nMARGARET Yeah.   I'm fine. Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully. MARGARET (cont'd) \n(SMILING) You shouldn't of laughed at me. \nRICHARD You woulda laughed at me. \nMARGARET Yeah.   While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark. They might kiss. \nRICHARD Gertrude wants me back. Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down. \nMARGARET And? \nRICHARD Well.   It seemed like you were having... second thoughts. \nMARGARET Yeah.   I was. \nRICHARD Maybe we should do it.   Come clean. \nMARGARET Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain her composure. MARGARET (cont'd) You wanna call it off? \nRICHARD If you do. \nMARGARET Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we get back. \nON THE BOAT Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her. Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY \nRichard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a hurry.   He's clearly been waiting. \nGEOFFREY Come with me. \nRICHARD Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk. \nGEOFFREY Not now.   C'mon. Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do. Geoffrey storms off and they follow. \nEXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY \nRichard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in. \nGEOFFREY (to Richard) I haven't told your mother about any of this, and I don't plan to. (to Margaret) I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside. \nINSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles. \nMR. GILBERTSON Hey there kids.   Good to see ya! \nRICHARD (to Dad) What did you do? Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself. RICHARD (cont'd) (getting angry) What did you do, dad?! \nRICHARD You look gorgeous. \nMARGARET \n(SMILING) You look disgusting. \nRICHARD So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl? \nMARGARET Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. MARGARET (cont'd) Ramone. \nRAMONE \n(QUIETLY) Mi amo. (To the crowd) We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments.   To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word \"unselfish,\" but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. RAMONE (cont'd) ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... \"True Love\" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices. RAMONE (cont'd) ...before their family and friends. \"Family and Friends\" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated. RAMONE (cont'd) For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today. \nRAMONE (cont'd) And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention. He's not sure what to do. RAMONE (cont'd) Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself. \nMARGARET No. \nRAMONE Then why is your hand up? \nMARGARET I have something to say.   It's not a question though. \nRAMONE Can it wait \u00e2\u0080\u0098til after? \nMARGARET Uh.   Um.   No. \nRICHARD What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner. \nMARGARET Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the \"wedding.\" \nRICHARD Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand. \nMARGARET Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air. \nMARGARET (cont'd) I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me. \nRICHARD Now wait... \nMARGARET Richard.   Please.   Let me finish. (to the Paxton family) Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't blame him.   This is all my fault. (to Ramone) Could you get the band started?   And give these people something to drink. (to Gilbertson) And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport. \nMR. GILBERTSON You got it! Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down. \nMARGARET Take care of him. \nGERTRUDE Promise. Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone. \nINT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY \nMargaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone. \nMARGARET (unenthusiastically to phone) Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good news.   Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up. \nRICHARD So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now. \nMARGARET Yup.   He's in.   For now. \nRICHARD Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird? \nMARGARET Yeah.   Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags. \nRICHARD Great exit back there. \nMARGARET Thanks.   Fun weekend. \nRICHARD Same old, same old, around here. \nMARGARET Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them. \n", "test1_input": "MARGARET She tell you to quit? \nRICHARD No.   No. (off Margaret's look) Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is. Richard's phone rings and he picks it up. \nRICHARD (cont'd) Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson? \nMARGARET Who is this guy? \nRICHARD He said you knew each other.   You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We rescheduled on him four times. \nMARGARET Go get him.   But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office. \nRICHARD (to himself) I'll charge up the cattle prod. \nINT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY \nMargaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up. \nMR. GILBERTSON Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read about it in P-W. \nMARGARET Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up. MARGARET (cont'd) Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember. \nMR. GILBERTSON Three years ago?   We worked together. \nMARGARET Don't have it... \nMR. GILBERTSON Remember \"Dandelion's Desire?\" Margaret gets excited. \nMARGARET Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend.   Without a doubt the worst ever written. \nMR. GILBERTSON You think? \nMARGARET It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability.   The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language. \nMR. GILBERTSON I believe there was a glossary... Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory. \nMARGARET Did you see the pass letter I wrote him? \nMR. GILBERTSON \n(QUOTING) \"Your grammar is impeccable, but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability.   Save your skills for the office newsletter, you sir, are no writer.\" A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact... \nMARGARET You wrote the book. \nMR. GILBERTSON I did. \nMARGARET You're Dante Dickens? \nMR. GILBERTSON One of my nom de plumes. Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss. \nMARGARET I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket. \nMR. GILBERTSON Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you to Canada. \nMARGARET Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for citizenship. \nMR. GILBERTSON You need citizenship now?   After the big promotion? \nMARGARET Yes.   And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down. \nMR. GILBERTSON Well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.   We must protect our sovereignty. \nMARGARET I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States? \nMR. GILBERTSON Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system. (as if he doesn't know) Will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years? \nMARGARET \"Affect me at work?\"   I'll lose my job! \n", "test1_true": "MARGARET Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it. \nMR. GILBERTSON Do what, Ms. Mills? \nMARGARET \nGilbertson smiles.   She's quick. \nMR. GILBERTSON I've edited it down.   It's better. \nMARGARET Well then, get it published at another house. \nMR. GILBERTSON They all just don't get me. \nMARGARET All? \nMR. GILBERTSON Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two hundred sixty-one.   Ish. \nMARGARET I'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book. \nMR. GILBERTSON I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and I'm desperate. \nMARGARET I will never publish your book.   Ever. \nMR. GILBERTSON There's no need to make this difficult.   I don't turn in your file until Monday... \nMARGARET This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss. \nMR. GILBERTSON I've spent two years preparing for this day. Don't you think I've thought of that? Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on. Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there is an \"emergency\" so Margaret can end the meeting. \nRICHARD Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs you right away. The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face. \nMARGARET Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere! We're getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about. \nRICHARD Who's getting married? \nMARGARET We are! \nRICHARD You and him? \nMARGARET Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused. MARGARET (cont'd) Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him about us.   About us getting married. \nMR. GILBERTSON You are marrying your male secretary? \nRICHARD Assistant. \nMR. GILBERTSON You are marrying your male assistant? \nMARGARET (matter of fact) We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When it's right, it's right. \nMR. GILBERTSON And this has nothing to do with my visit here today? \nMARGARET Nope.   True love.   Got it bad. \nMR. GILBERTSON (to Richard) You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying this... woman? Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand. \nMARGARET Of course we are. \nMR. GILBERTSON \nPainfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret squeezes Richard's hand hard. \nRICHARD Uh-huh. Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm around her.   Richard is truly afraid. RICHARD (cont'd) (more of a question) I'm, uh, marrying my boss? Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together. Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head. \nMR. GILBERTSON Five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine. \nMARGARET What? \n", "test2_input": "GERTRUDE Find out what? \nRICHARD If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry. \nGERTRUDE Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do? (voice cracking) I guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile. \nRICHARD I'm so sorry. \n(BEAT) But, I gotta go. \nGERTRUDE Uh-huh. Richard gets up. \nRICHARD Are you OK? \nGERTRUDE I'm fine.   Really.   Go. Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - PARTY - DAY \nDebbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar, dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited. \nGEOFFREY What are you so God damn happy about? \nRICHARD What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see Margaret. \nGEOFFREY What?! \nDEBBIE She violated you.   We should report her. \nRICHARD Who you gonna report her to, mom? \nDEBBIE Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome. \nRICHARD I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And she didn't violate me. \nDEBBIE What is going on, Richard? Richard slows down and explains to his mom. \nRICHARD I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful thing to do.   But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me.   I think she's... the one. \nDEBBIE But you already thought she was the one. \nRICHARD No, I didn't.   Not until she left. \nDEBBIE Really?   Does she think that too? \nRICHARD I don't know.   I've got to get to the airport to find out. Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile. \nDEBBIE (so romantic) He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the airport! \nRICHARD But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any second.   I might not make it. \nDEBBIE (so romantic) He's not sure he's going to make it! \nGEOFFREY Are you buying this horse shit? \nDEBBIE Oh, Geoffrey! \nRICHARD I don't have time to explain this to you. \nGEOFFREY Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I won't let you throw your life away for some woman. \nRICHARD I don't care. \nGEOFFREY Excuse me? \nRICHARD I don't care.   I love you and want you to understand.   But I'm not asking your permission here.   I'm doing this. \nGEOFFREY Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts. \n", "test2_true": "GEOFFREY Mom, are you OK? \nANNIE I'm having a... I need to go to the hospital.   Fast. \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nMargaret and Gilbertson board the jet together.   Margaret finds her seat in first class and discovers the Handsome Man from the flight before sitting nearby. \nHANDSOME MAN (re: Gilbertson) Is this another gay assistant? Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat. \nEXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY \nTWO COAST GUARDSMAN carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting helicopter.   Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind.   They all pile into a large chopper and fly off. \nINT. COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nAn oxygen mask covers Annie's face.   Geoffrey holds her hand. Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down. Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise. \nGEOFFREY Richard!   She has something she wants to say to us! Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through the oxygen mask. \nANNIE Listen to me.   You two need to stop fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it. (to Geoffrey) Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if you don't agree with him. \nGEOFFREY I... I promise. \nANNIE And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family. \nRICHARD I promise, Grandma. \nANNIE OK, then. Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes. \nThen suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th pilot. ANNIE (cont'd) (as if nothing happened) I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go to the hospital.   Take us to the airport, please. Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even. \nGEOFFREY What... what is going on? (so the Coast Guard can't hear) Did you fake a heart attack? \nANNIE We didn't have time for your squabbling, and I knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport.   It seemed like the best way. \nRICHARD The best way? \nANNIE And remember, you two promised me that you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding about that. \nCOAST GUARD PILOT Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the airport... \nANNIE (to pilot) Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your mother! \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nGilbertson talks non-stop.   Margaret is in hell. \nMR. GILBERTSON ...I want my book launch to be special.   I'm thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky Monastery.   In St. Petersberg? Margaret stares at him blankly. MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd) (as if she should know) Where Dostoyevsky is buried?   Hello?   I thought you were a professional... Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain. \nEXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY \nThe helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out.   His family follows as they run to the control tower. \nINT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY \nCHUCK has an easy job.   Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only about six flights a day.   He is half awake as he radios Margaret's flight.   Reggae music plays in the background. \nCHUCK Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff. \nPILOT (O.S.) Roger that, Chuck. The PHONE RINGS in the tower.   Chuck picks up.   Intercut as necessary, with Richard running on a cell phone. \nCHUCK Tower.   Talk to me. \nRICHARD Hey Chuck, it's Richard. \nCHUCK Hey man.   Heard about your lady bailing. How often does this happen to you? \n", "test3_input": "RICHARD Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could you stop it for me? \nCHUCK No can do brohan.   Need a good reason for the FAA holes.   Lose my jobby job if I delivered that favor. \nRICHARD Oh, c'mon Chuck! \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nThe plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson. \nMR. GILBERTSON ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the Paris Hilton's, OK? Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave Sitka. \nEXT. TOWER - DAY \nRichard and his family stand outside the tower and watch Margaret's plane take off. \nRICHARD Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath. \nGEOFFREY So, you know I think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right? \nRICHARD You've made that crystal clear. \nGEOFFREY Good. (looks at Annie) Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits for an answer. GEOFFREY (cont'd) (to phone) Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something.   But that's what I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask you, \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout one of your planes... \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nGilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor. \nMR. GILBERTSON ...you know those two hundred pages I took out?   I'm going to put them back... A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me? Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson. \nMARGARET Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat. \nMR. GILBERTSON What's this about? \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (never done this before) There's someone on the radio for you. The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at the front of the plane, outside the cockpit. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd) Uh, a Richard Paxton? Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt. \nMARGARET Tell him I'm not here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWER - DAY \nRichard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower. Chuck sits nearby. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) (from radio) I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you. \nRICHARD Shit!   She's never going to pick up... \nCHUCK (to Richard) Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd totally be into you... Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic. \nRICHARD Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor... \nCUT TO: \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nDING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker. \nCAPTAIN (over plane loudspeaker) Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is your captain.   We've reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be three hours and thirty minutes.   And Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like to say to you. \nRICHARD (O.S.) (over loudspeaker) Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane. The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she doesn't know either. RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd) (over loudspeaker) This certainly isn't how I wanted to do this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So here goes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWER - DAY \n", "test3_true": "CHUCK You're doing great, man. Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike. \nRICHARD I know you're used to being on your own. And that you're comfortable with your life the way it is.   And that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together.   I know, because I felt the exact same way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nEvery passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the loudspeaker.   The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone. \nRICHARD (O.S.) (over loudspeaker) And you know what else I know?   I know that I'm tired of being alone.   And I think you're tired of being alone too.   So come on.   Talk to me.   Please. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret. \nHANDSOME MAN (with genuine concern) Do you really feel like you're alone? \nMARGARET Oh, good lord. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TOWER - DAY \nRichard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if there is going to be an answer.   Chuck crosses his fingers. \nMARGARET (O.S.) (from radio) What the hell are you doing? Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress. \nRICHARD We need to talk. (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the plane with the passengers watching.) \nMARGARET About what? \nRICHARD Have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years? \nMARGARET As boss and assistant. \nRICHARD Things change, Margaret. \nMARGARET \n(INCREDULOUS) Things change? \nRICHARD Yeah, things change. \nMARGARET Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say \"see, that's what I said.\" Richard composes himself. \nRICHARD Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore? Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one. \nMARGARET What's your point? \nRICHARD Because I am sick that you left.   And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together? Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it. Gilbertson panics. \nMR. GILBERTSON Are you thinking about going back to him? Margaret doesn't answer. MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd) We have a deal!   You can't back out now! The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying to break up Richard and Margaret. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Sir, you need to sit down. \nMR. GILBERTSON I will do no such thing. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your seat. Other passengers yell \"sit down asshole\" at Gilbertson. \nMR. GILBERTSON Who said that? \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Sir, this is your third and final warning! \nMR. GILBERTSON Listen sweetheart... (he pokes the flight attendant) I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get me another cocktail and mind your own... BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor. Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge. \nHANDSOME MAN Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And you're under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible intoxication. \nThe Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers. HANDSOME MAN (cont'd) Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need to get this unruly passenger off the plane ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain turn this bird around. There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes. HANDSOME MAN (cont'd) (winks at Margaret) Told you I was a romantic. \nEXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY \n"}

MIRANDA Carrie, I understand -- but it just happened -- I never meant to hurt you. (beat) You have to forgive me. 
Carrie looks over at her. 
CARRIE You know -- 
MIRANDA What? 
CARRIE No. 
MIRANDA Please. What were you going to say? 
CARRIE You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago. 
MIRANDA It's not the same thing. 
CARRIE It's forgiveness. 
Miranda thinks -- Carrie looks at her. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) And -- I know you're not the reason my marriage fell apart. I was just - desperate to have someone else to blame. 
Miranda thinks. The METER clicks.

201    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE -- DAY -- WINTER                   201 
Steve and Miranda are sitting in front of a THERAPIST. 
MIRANDA I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again. 
122A. 
THERAPIST Steve - you're very quiet today. 
STEVE Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But -- You made it hard for me to trust you. 
MIRANDA Me?! 
STEVE The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about that? 
Miranda looks down at her hands. Steve looks at the therapist. 
STEVE (CONT'D) How do I know she won't punish me for the rest of my life? 
THERAPIST You don't. And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion. (beat) All you can know... is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen. 
Silence. 
THERAPIST (CONT'D) And that's what we'll discover here. 
Steve looks over at Miranda. Miranda looks at Steve. 
202   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY -- SPRING                        202 
Forsythia bushes are in bloom. Carrie and Miranda walk. They carry sandwiches. 
MIRANDA So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward. 
CARRIE Can you do that? 
MIRANDA I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do. 
CARRIE Thinking -- or feeling? 
MIRANDA What do you mean? 
CARRIE Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions. 
MIRANDA Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel. 
CARRIE You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past. 
MIRANDA And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge. 
CARRIE Where is it? 
MIRANDA The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places. 
CARRIE Very logical. And yet poetic. 
MIRANDA Poetic -- if we both show up. Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected. Not a good plan. 
203    INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  203 
Carrie walks in carrying a Starbucks cardboard caddy with two coffee. Louise is sitting at her desk, working. 
LOUISE I have two pieces of good news. 
CARRIE And I have two coffees. 
LOUISE I just got a heads-up from your realtor. The apartment on Fifth finally sold. 
Carrie sips coffee. Nods. 
LOUISE (CONT'D) You have sixty days before the new owner takes possession and you are out of there. 
CARRIE What's the other news? 
Louise holds up her hand. There is a diamond ring on it. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) Oh my God -- 
LOUISE I'm moving back to St. Louis -- we are getting married in the fall. 
Louise beams. Carrie hugs her. 
204    EXT. BEACH -- DAY -- SPRING                                 204 
Grey day. Samantha is sitting on the beach reading "The Secret." 
CARRIE (V.O.) Meanwhile, back in Lost Angeles... 
She rolls her eyes, and tosses it down in the sand. 
204A   EXT. BEACH -- A LITTLE LATER                               204A 
Samantha walks on the beach. The dog is walking with her.

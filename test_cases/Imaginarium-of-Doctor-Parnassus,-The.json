{"train": "THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS \nWritten by \nTerry McKeown & Charles Gilliam \nMay 26th, 2007 \nLONDON 2007.. NOW \n1   EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE                                1 \nA row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain. \nA front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a TV flickers. \nDON Carol!... Carol! \nCAROL (V.O.) What? \nDON Come here! Quick! \nCAROL (V.O.) What is it? \nDON Quick! \nCAROL (V.O.) (irritated) I'm trying to watch this! It's the last episode! \nDON (annoyed) Come here!!! \nCAROL appears in the doorway. \nCAROL What is it? \nBut the wagon and horses have gone. \nDON It's gone! \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                  1 \nCAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her hand and goes back inside. \n2   EXT/INT   NIGHT    PARKED CAR IN STREET                       2 \nA YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car. Music is playing on the radio. \nThey are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles past. \n3   EXT   NIGHT     THE TOWN HALL CLOCK                           3 \nThe clock shows and strikes 2am. \n4   EXT   NIGHT     A DINGY BACK STREET                           4 \nThe wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals. \nShadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof. \nWhile this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street. \nA group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having \"a great time\". \nThey see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks. \nMARTIN What the...! \nWe now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS. \nPERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                4 \nANTON/MERCURY Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus! \nPERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him. \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing. \nA young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward. \nANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps together. They look enchanting and enchanted. \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) (to the audience) Or, if you must... \nNow PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery . \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED: (2)                                             4 \nANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D) ... scour the squalid depths with Putrid's brother, Stench! \n10   CONTINUED: (3)                                              10 \nDAD (to the DR. PARNASSUS, threateningly) Oy! \nPARNASSUS ignores him and resumes his trance. \nUnnoticed by all, DIEGO has somehow managed to climb onto the stage and is peering at the mirror. \nMUM (looking around) Diego!? Where's Diego? \nDAD DIEGO!? \nVALENTINA turns her head just in time to see DIEGO vanish through the mirror. \nShe starts to go after him, then hesitates. \nVALENTINA (trying to get ANTON'S attention) Pssst! \nANTON looks across the stage to her. She mimes that a certain someone has gone into the mirror. ANTON considers waking DOCTOR PARNASSUS but thinks better of it. Instead he heads off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego. VALENTINA takes over the pitch. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, let Dr. Parnassus be your guide... \n11   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                 11 \nANTON moves through the cut -out trees and into a fantastic, brightly coloured landscape of Dr. Seuss-like hills and valleys. The sky if full of cloud-sized soap bubbles. \nDiego is in the distant using his game controller to make the bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them. \nWe can hear VALENTINA trying to continue the pitch in the face of the family from hell. Their baby has now started wailing. \nCracks in the ground begin to appear under ANTON\"S feet. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                   11 \nVALENTINA (V.O.) Beauty, Truth, Wisdom, Justice... without imagination all are dead. \nMUM (V.O.) DIEGO!!! \nDAD (V.O.) DIEGO!!! \nLINDA (V.O.) DEGSY! \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! SHUT UP! \nThe landscape, in response to DR. PARNASSUS' rage suddenly rips apart, fragmenting and spinning with ANTON inside it. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) (enraged) AAAHHHH!!! DAMN AND BLAST!!! \nThings fly in all directions. \n12   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                   12 \nANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of stone. The world has gone dark. \nHe hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths.. \nReaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle. \nCUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the buttons on his gaming device - to no avail. \nOne of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music blares forth. \nMR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a bull's-eye on his chest. \n(CONTINUED) \n12   CONTINUED:                                                12 \nMR NICK Come on laddy, cross the bridge! Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy. Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo. Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow! \nAs he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel. \nThe other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance. \nPIANO TEACHERS No, no, start again! Again! From the top! Again! Practice! Practice! \nDIEGO doesn't know what to do. \nBehind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR. PARNASSUS's face is repeated again and again around its circumference. ANTON'S in the basket. \nDIEGO catches sight of ANTON. \nDIEGO Help! (indicating gaming device) It doesn't work! It's broken! \nANTON What? \nDIEGO The game! \nANTON What g-g-game? \nDIEGO The game! The video game! The one we're in! \nANTON I d-d-don't know what you're t-t- talking about. \nThe INSPECTOR OF FAIRS is joined by a POLICEMAN and POLICEWOMAN. \nPOLICEMAN What's the trouble? \nDR. PARNASSUS Ah, the fuzz. \nPOLICEMAN What did you say? \nDR. PARNASSUS (charmingly) Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy? \nThe POLICE and the INSPECTOR exchange dark looks. Clearly they're dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker. \nINSPECTOR (to Parnassus) Next time I find you doing business without a permit I'll impound your wagon. \nPOLICEMAN (to Parnassus) I'll be doing worse than that...now, bugger off! \nDR. PARNASSUS With pleasure. \nHe bows mock graciously. \n14   INT   BACK STAGE   DRESSING ROOM   A MOMENT LATER           14 \nValentina, half-undressed, is struggling out of her `Wisdom' costume while at the same time looking at pictures of beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of `Homes and Gardens'. Without make-up and costume she appears much younger. \n(CONTINUED) \n14   CONTINUED:                                                  14 \nA movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror catches her eye. \nIn the mirror we see MR NICK, not a CUT-OUT, but the real thing. \nVALENTINA (startled, guiltily hiding `Homes and Gardens') Oh! \nShe turns, holding her dress to cover her modesty. There's nobody there. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) Who's that? Who's there? \n15   EXT   EDGE OF FAIR / THE WAGON       CONTINUOUS              15 \nANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon. \nDR. PARNASSUS, out of his make-up and costume, is smiling and humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the horses. \nThe horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock and horror. Standing directly behind the horse is MR. NICK... a huge grin splitting his face. \nMR NICK Hello Parnassus... It's been a while hasn't it? \nPERCY, winding a rope onto a cleat, hears distant laughter and looks up. \nCUT TO PERCY'S P.O.V. where we see, some distance away and in a relatively secluded spot, MR NICK rocking with laughter while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken. He clutches at the back of a park bench to steady himself. \nCUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried. He heads off to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench. MR NICK has vanished. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (distraught) He's come to collect. \nPERCY I thought so. \n(CONTINUED) \n15   CONTINUED:                                               15 \nDR. PARNASSUS What can I do?... \nPERCY (grimly) Nothing. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS There must be something! \nHe looks over to where VALENTINA is helping close the theatre. PERCY follows his gaze. \nPERCY You're going to have to tell her. \n16   EXT   CITY STREETS      LATER                             16 \nThe wagon makes its way through city streets. \nPERCY is sitting on the roof driving. ANTON is lying on the roof looking up at the stars. VALENTINA is sitting next to him lost in thought. \nANTON Look at that moon. (no response from Valentina) I've n-never seen it so b-big. And the stars...It's so c-clear. \nPERCY holds his hand out, palm up. \nPERCY (sardonically) Rain. \nANTON (sotto voce) Valentina? \nVALENTINA (irritated) Val... Val. \nANTON I c-c-can't call you Val, P- Parnassus d-doesn't like it. \n(CONTINUED) \n16   CONTINUED:                                                 16 \nVALENTINA He's not here is he? He's inside getting pissed. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (startled) Valentina... \nShe comes in. \nVALENTINA I go to all this trouble and you leave it. \nDR. PARNASSUS I'm not hungry. \nVALENTINA Are you ill? \nDR. PARNASSUS (anguished) Valentina... my miraculous child.. I have something to tell you. \nVALENTINA Now what? \nShe starts tidying up. \nDR. PARNASSUS (avoiding the question) I should never have brought you into this rotten bloody world! \nVALENTINA (she's heard this before) Oh for God's sake! \nDR. PARNASSUS What was I thinking of! \nVALENTINA Percy liked the soup. \nDR. PARNASSUS (agitated) Why does everybody want to live forever? \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED: (2)                                             17 \nVALENTINA That's normal isn't it? \nDR. PARNASSUS Immortality's a curse! Any fool can tell you that! \nValentina picks up Parnassus' nearly empty bottle. \nVALENTINA You know it doesn't agree with you. \nDR. PARNASSUS (in difficulty) Valentina... \nVALENTINA (losing patience) And I'll be sixteen on Thursday, so let's not have any more tosh about that. \nDR. PARNASSUS Listen to me! \nVALENTINA You think you're so clever and that everybody else is an idiot! You can't stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday! It's ridiculous! \nDR. PARNASSUS Shut up! Shut up and listen to me! Listen to me! I need to tell you something, before it's too late! \nDR PARNASSUS reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of the air. It's that kind that contains little models which are engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken. \nDR. PARNASSUS shakes the paper-weight and watches the `snow' swirl about. \nDR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) One dark winter's night... Many years ago...? \nVALENTINA Is this going to take long? \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED: (3)                                            17 \nDR. PARNASSUS QUIET! \nTHE CAMERA closes in on and `enters' the paperweight. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Many centuries ago, as a matter of fact... \n18   EXT   INSIDE THE PAPERWEIGHT    NIGHT                        18 \nA HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm, the horse picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) ... I was visited... by someone I had hoped never to meet. \nIn the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange monastery. Dim light comes from a couple of windows. \nWe can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of the story teller, a younger DR. PARNASSUS. \nTHE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER, continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests, valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a rugged hill. Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery windows, taking us into a dining hall. \n19   INT   MONASTERY DINING HALL    NIGHT                         19 \nEntering via a window and looking down into the monastery dining hall, we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long refectory table. They are eating their supper and listening to a young DR. PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a story. \nA log fire burns in a big fireplace. \nDR. PARNASSUS ... Having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the Chief Steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... He dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow-swept plain. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                  19 DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) A rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world... \nThe door to the refectory swings open with a crash. \nThe MONKS look up. \nStanding on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure, covered with snow. \nDR. PARNASSUS (smiling) Yes? \nMR NICK stubs out his cigarette. \nMR NICK I tell you what... You're probably not a betting man but... \nMR NICK whispers into the DR. PARNASSUS's ear. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) And so I made a wager with the devil. \n21   EXT   ON THE ROAD (MIDDLE AGES)    DAY/NIGHT               21 \nDR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are travelling the world with a little theatre. Giving performances. Inviting AUDIENCE MEMBERS onto the stage to participate. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) Whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... My argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... His, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... Naturally... I won. \nCUT TO another performance. Now the 16TH CENTURY. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O. (CONT'D) My prize... (a voice filled with horror) ... was ever-lasting life. \nAnother show...now the 18TH CENTURY \n(CONTINUED) \n21   CONTINUED:                                                   21 \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Everlasting torment... Everlasting... Everlasting... Times changed. No one wanted our tales any longer. \n22   EXT.   MODERN CITY STREET     DAY                             22 \nDR. PARNASSUS and PERCY are performing on a street corner in modern clothes. As are all the PASSERSBY who pay them no attention. \nThey look exhausted, like beggars...and very old. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) It seemed as though the Devil, after all... had triumphed... And then... one day.... \nA BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (played by the same actress as Valentina, but older with different coloured hair) comes into view. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the very first moment I saw her, I was head-over-heels in love. She was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... But I... I was several thousand years old! How could I woo her? What could I do? \n23   EXT.   CLIFF TOP    EVENING                                   23 \nCUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off the cliff. \nPERCY Don't be a fool! You can't die! You're immortal! You'll just end up broken, in the eternity ward, and I'll be stuck looking after you! Forever! \nDR. PARNASSUS breaks free, stumbles backwards, and pitches out into space. PERCY screams. \nDR. PARNASSUS V.O. At times like these... the devil is never far away. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                               23 \nDR. PARNASSUS is hanging by his coat, snagged on a branch angled out from the cliff face and held, like a fishing rod, by MR NICK who has a great grin on his face. \n24   EXT.   RIVER      DAY                                     24 \nCUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They are in love, very happy to be together. \nPERCY, wearing a blazer, flannels and straw boater is rowing or punting. \nDR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) The devil granted me mortality again...and youth and great powers. I won my bride. I was in love. But at what price... \nThe boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up, DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing, smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK . \nThere is a loud and ominous clap of thunder. \n25   INT.   PARNASSUS' DEN        NIGHT                        25 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS ...at what price.... \nDR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and drops the paper-weight. \nVALENTINA Father!... \nAt that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof. \nDR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on. \nDR. PARNASSUS We've stopped. \nVALENTINA What do you mean `at what price'? \n(CONTINUED) \n25   CONTINUED:                                                    25 \nDR. PARNASSUS (turning back to his Tarot cards) It'll wait, it'll wait. Another time. Something's happened. You'd better go and see. \nVALENTINA Typical! You insist I listen to a story and then you don't finish it! \nMore banging from above. \nDR. PARNASSUS Go and see! \nThe MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the kiss of life. \nANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the kiss of life and he pulls her away. \nANTON No! That won't work. And anyway, you d-don't know where he's b-been. Let me... \nHe brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S chest. \nBoing! The `dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of the wagon, knocking himself out. \nThe little metal tube clatters over the asphalt. \nANTON (CONT'D) He's alive! \nVALENTINA Thank God. \nPERCY Well, he was. \nANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it. \nANTON What on earth is this? \n29   EXT   BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE        REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER   29 \nVALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon and carry him to the rear. \nVALENTINA Put him in the big trunk. \nANTON B-but... \nVALENTINA Don't argue. \nPERCY The boss said leave him. \n(CONTINUED) \n29   CONTINUED:                                                 29 \nVALENTINA He thought he was dead. \nThey start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops. \nANTON I d-don't like it. It's none of our b-business. \nVALENTINA So, what do you suggest, we leave him on the side of the road? \nANTON doesn't want to answer that one. \nPERCY (walking away) Definitely. \nVALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not missed by ANTON. \n30   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS       DAWN                         30 \nThe wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings. All is quiet. \nThe lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens. \nThe MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict buildings. \nSome distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is involved in a strange contorted dance. \nHoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him. \nPERCY (V.O.) Hey, you! \nThe MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him. \nPERCY (CONT'D) I suppose somebody saves your life everyday of the week. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                               30 \nMAN (croaking) What? \nHe can hardly speak. It hurts him to do so. \nPERCY Too much like routine to bother with a thank you. \nMAN (with difficulty) Who are you? \nPERCY Percival St. Antoine della Touraine et Sansepolcro da Piemonte the Third. If that proves too difficult, you may call me Percy. \nMAN Where are we? \nPERCY Geographically, in the Northern Hemisphere. Socially, on the margins. Narratively, with some way to go. And your name is... \nMAN (appalled) I... I can't remember. \nPERCY That's handy. \nPERCY whistles to the dancing CREATURE, who turns and approaches. The MAN is getting very nervous. \nPERCY (CONT'D) Any credit cards? \nVALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles - slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention. \nPARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him. \nPERCY Five souls.. two days, eh!? \nDR. PARNASSUS Shh! I'm trying to think. \nPERCY I told you didn't I? \nDR. PARNASSUS What? \nPERCY That he was a wrong-un. \nPERCY nods his head in George's direction. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED:                                                 42 \nDR. PARNASSUS Trust in providence, Percy. Remember the hanging man. The cards don't lie. \nPERCY No... but they sure as hell like being economical with the truth. \nCUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed, wooden flower...he comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand. \nVALENTINA (looking away) Don't talk to me. \nANTON P-please...I'm sorry about last night. I behaved like an idiot. \nVALENTINA Yes. \nANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud. Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing. \nANTON You must admit... even idiots have their qualities. \nCUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes, badly. PARNASSUS and PERCY come up behind him. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS George... We'd like to know who you really are. \nGEORGE What?... Yes. Me too. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS I may be able to help. \nGEORGE Really? What?... How...? \nPERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS. \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: (2)                                              42 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Hold this piece of wire. \nPERCY You won't feel a thing. \nGEORGE takes the end of the wire. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS I'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head. \nHe does so. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) I want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing. \nGEORGE That's not difficult... in my condition. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes. He seems to be making an effort. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Hold your breath. \nGEORGE does so. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I see... I see... Very interesting. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGE'S head and gives the contraption back to PERCY. \nPERCY You may breathe normally. \nThe effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit down. \nGEORGE What... ? \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Alas, this technique has its limitations. \nGEORGE But... Did you discover anything? \n(CONTINUED) \n42   CONTINUED: (3)                                           42 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (dramatically) Your name. \nGEORGE My name?... What is it? \nPAUSE. \nPERCY He's in love with Valentina? \nDR. PARNASSUS (dumbfounded) In love....? \nPERCY It happens. \nDR. PARNASSUS The little snake! I'll skin him alive! \nCUT TO ANTON who winces. \nPERCY While you're at it, don't forget the other one. \nDR. PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly. \nPERCY (CONT'D) The viper, the scorpion, the amnesiac boa constrictor. Tony. \nDR. PARNASSUS Quite another kettle of fish. \nPERCY Really? \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS He's ambitious, energetic... a man of destiny. \n(CONTINUED) \n43   CONTINUED:                                                43 \nPERCY (ironic) And he's going to help us win five souls. \nDR. PARNASSUS I think he might. Valentina sees good in him. \nPERCY She'd be better off with Anton. \nCUT TO ANTON who's pleased. \nDR. PARNASSUS Perhaps I should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls. \nCUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled. \nPERCY That's even worse than the other ideas you've had today. \nDR. PARNASSUS (sighs) You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what would I do without you? \nPERCY Get a midget. \nCUT TO ANTON as he moves, thoughtfully, away. \n44   EXT   OUTSIDE PUB       NIGHT                              44 \nThe theatre, parked outside a pub, is up and running. \nANTON, as Mercury, is doing his pitch. \nANTON Sleep no more. Procrastinate no longer. Embrace this once in a life- time opportunity. Let the mind of Doctor Parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination. \nBehind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him. \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED:                                                  44 \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS What are you doing? Please concentrate. We've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. A great deal depends on it. \nA roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR PARNASSUS `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth. \nANTON As old as the universe itself, the great Doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny. \nHowever, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working the sparse crowd with his smooth charm. \nANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is worried about the lack of customers. \nTONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles seductively at her. \nThe sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage. \nPERCY keeps playing. \nSALLY (laughing) What?... Hey, what you doing? \nANTON T-taking you to the heart of your imagination! \nANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just can't manage the charm. \nSALLY (good humoured) Oh my god! No way! \nANTON You won't regret it! \n(CONTINUED) \n44   CONTINUED: (2)                                       44 \nFEMALE FRIEND Go for it Sal! \nSALLY (indicating friend) Only if she comes with me. \nFEMALE FRIEND (enthusiastic) Now you're talking! \n(CONTINUED) \n46   CONTINUED:                                                  46 \nPERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of shots into the air. \nEVERYONE dives for cover. \nPERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes. \nThe theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it goes. \nVOICE IN CROWD Somebody call the police! \nA battered TONY, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to clamber on board, with the help of VALENTINA. \nThe wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the CROWD. As it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon. \nIt's the terrified SALLY, sent sprawling in the middle of the road. \nA figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet. It's MR. NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat. \n47   EXT.   RUBBISH TIP      NIGHT                                47 \nA police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose, broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance. \n48   INT/EXT   THEATRE/WAGON      NIGHT                           48 \nAmongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap. The others are struggling to their feet. ANTON is desperately trying to do something useful to help PARNASSUS but, VALENTINA pushes him out of the way. \nVALENTINA What were you thinking? Look what you've done. Get out of the way! (appealing to Tony) Tony. \nTONY, battered and bleeding, helps her lift PARNASSUS and manoeuvre him to his room. \n(CONTINUED) \n48   CONTINUED:                                                   48 \nANTON is mortified.      PERCY pats him on the back. \nPERCY Better luck next time. \n49   INT    PARNASSUS' ROOM    NIGHT                               49 \nTONY helps VALENTINA get PARNASSUS comfortable. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (babbling) This is my punishment. All is lost. First to Five. One down. Impossible, Valentina. First to five. One down. No people. No time, Valentina. We are doomed. \nVALENTINA (very concerned) Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us. \nTONY, nods, leaves slowly. Listening. \n50   EXT.    WAGON    NIGHT                                        50 \nPERCY is angrily banging about, trying to repair the damage. ANTON is trying to help but, is just getting in the way. \nPERCY Do me a favour. Take a long walk off a short pier. \nTONY arrives. \nTONY Can I help? \nPERCY Bugger off! \nTONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the wagon swigging from a bottle. He sits down next to him. \nANTON L-leave me alone. \nTONY What were you doing to that girl behind the mirror? \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                                50 \nANTON (incensed) What are you suggesting? \nTONY Oh, c'mon...we all heard her screaming. \nANTON I was screaming as well.   It was t- terrifying... \nTONY Terrifying? Why? I don't understand. \nANTON (reluctantly) No, well...you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you? \nTONY Your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real? \nANTON You think it's some k-kind of scam, d-don't you? \nTONY Isn't it? \nANTON No... But I d-don't expect you to g- get it... N-not in a million years. \nTONY Hang on.. if he can really control people's minds, why isn't he ruling the world? Why bother with this crappy side show? \nANTON He d-doesn't want to rule the world d-does he?... He wants the world to rule itself! \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED: (3)                                            52 \nTONY The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return. \nPARNASSUS confers with PERCY. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Our time's nearly up... This could be what we need. \nTONY (to Valentina) This can be my birthday gift to Valentina. \nVALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS. \nDR. PARNASSUS Well then... (with a burst of energy) For God's sake let's do it!!! \nPERCY (sighs) Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we do? \nTONY Well... First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it. \nWhat?!   PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other. \nThen PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON, downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand. \nDR. PARNASSUS Anton!   Where are you going? \nNo answer from ANTON. \nVALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently. \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED: (4)                                              52 \nVALENTINA What are you doing? Didn't you do enough damage last night? (pummmelling his back) Anton... I'm the one who wants to run away! (he slows) Are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what? \nAnton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops his suitcase. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) Please. We need you. \nMoved, ANTON turns to her.   She smiles sweetly. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) How much money have you got? \n53   EXT   BOND STREET   EVENING                                  53 \nClose up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's savings. A sign proclaims \"Please Take Generously\" \nDirectly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money. \nThe wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past. \nNew signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium - More Exclusive than ever'. \nThe stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other white. \nOn the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is, in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag. \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                    53 \nCenter stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded. \nOn the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty. She gracefully combs her hair. \nAbove the mirror is a sign proclaiming \"The Naked Truth\". \nDR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire. \nTONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the stage. \nNobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd. \nA few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go. \nTONY (retrieving the money) Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this. \nThe woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money. \nTONY (CONT'D) We are here to give...not take. We are here to help those in need. If it's money you need, then here it is. (referring to the glass plinth) If it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. But thank you.. I can see you have a generous spirit. \nTONY returns to his pensive pose.    The women look at each other. \nWOMAN Excuse me but, how does this work? What does it cost? \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED: (2)                                           53 \nTONY Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium.   This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified. \nWOMAN 2 How long does that take?   I'm running late. \nTONY Madam, why should you care about time? What are your dreams worth in minutes? \nTHE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully, pulling him onwards. \nLOUIS VUITTON WOMAN Why would I want to go without you darling? \nTONY It's one of the rules... One imagination at a time, free from the influence of another. \nLOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (petulant) Boring. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED: (2)                                              54 \nThey have reached the bridge. Stairs descend to a stream. \nTONY Oh..look... another possibility.. \nBelow them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean, Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a dark, towering Egyptian pyramid. \nTONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN. \nTONY (CONT'D) You must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, I'd strongly recommend this one. \nLOUIS VUITTON WOMAN But... Rudolph Valentino, James Dean, Princess Di?... all these people... they're dead. \nTONY (thinking fast) Exactly. To be reborn, first you must die. All of them have achieved a kind of immortality. And we love them all the more for it. They won't get old or fat. They won't get sick or feeble. They are beyond fear. They are forever young. They are gods. And you can join them. \nLOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (softening) You're such a wonderful speaker. \nThe gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the helm. THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him. \nTONY There's not a moment to lose. \nBut as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY, looking past the WOMAN\"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER HAT... and it's angry. \n(CONTINUED) \n54   CONTINUED: (3)                                           54 \nTONY (CONT'D) But your sacrifice must be pure. You have to let go of all these worldly goods. \nHe helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace, earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her. \nTONY (CONT'D) Remember nothing is permanent... not even death. \nHe turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope. At its end.. a hangman's noose. \nTONY stares at it darkly disconcerted. \n55   EXT.   STAGE     EVENING                                  55 \nTONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR. PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with astonishment \nTONY (gobsmacked) That was so... I had no idea... It's just... incredible. \n...And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour realizing that only a few moments have passed since he entered the mirror. \nTONY (CONT'D) ..how do you do this? \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (ignoring him and with a big theatrical gesture) Hooplah! \nThe LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant. \nShe is weeping, completely overcome by her experience. PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses his hands in gratitude. \n(CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:                                                  55 \nLOUIS VUITTON WOMAN Thank you, thank you, that was so beautiful, I feel so... thank you so much... \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (graciously) Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me strength to continue \nBorn again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque. \nTONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe. \nPause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into a more-or-less orderly queue. \nAcross the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued... \n...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the glass box. \nTONY pays off the cops who move on. \nTONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS. \nDR. PARNASSUS (aside to Percy) One more to go and we're free. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles, holds up four fingers. \nMR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turns away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden with luxury shopping walk past. \nOne of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN pulls him on. \n(CONTINUED) \nANTON Stop it! L-leave him alone! \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED: (3)                                              56 \nThe RUSSIANS turn and, thinking ANTON is a fat, bossy, middle- aged woman, hesitate. \nANTON (CONT'D) Stand b-back! I'm warning you! \nFoolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY. \nGREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode. \nGREGOR (bending down and picking a flower, he offers it to ANTON) Relax. Smell the flowers. \nConfused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR floors him with a powerful punch on the nose \nMeanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck. He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... \n... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath. \nThe mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in.. \nThe terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope. \nTONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth. \nBehind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads \"JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE\".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number. \nThe astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on. \nSuddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian. \nSpinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her. \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED: (4)                                             56 \nRUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN) Mama!   Mama! Help! Save us! \nAs they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward. Smoke spews out from below. \nStraightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of the collar. He smiles smugly. \nThe giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything. \nThe dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing. \nTONY Did you see me!! I almost reached the clouds! I could have...it was incredible...I was almost there... \nANTON Shut up! \nOver a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses. ANTON drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it. \nTONY I made my choice and I climbed... I felt so much potential. I could have done anything. I have to have another chance...another go...I need this... \n57   EXT   SOMEWHERE DOWN RIVER - MUD FLATS   EVENING             57 \nThe wagon is parked on waste ground. It looms out of nowhere illuminated by a light leaking from within. \nWe hear PERCY'S angry voice. \nPERCY O/S Maybe you were holding them upside down. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS What? \n(CONTINUED) \n57   CONTINUED:                                                  57 \nPERCY That cards! The bloody Tarot cards! \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S (distraught and angry) Enough, Percy! Enough! \nTONY O/S I made a mistake. A big mistake. I know that and I'm sorry. \n58   INT   THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                                58 \nThe angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and jumbled scenery. TONY is on trial. \nDR. PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner, head in hands. He seems utterly destroyed. \nANTON You're a l-liar. You've been lying to us all along. Who are you? Who were those thugs? \nTONY I am not a liar! \nANTON No? \nTONY No! I just... didn't divulge everything I knew. \nPERCY Comes to the same thing. \nTONY Absolutely not. Not in law. \nThe horses are standing steaming nearby. \nDR. PARNASSUS (very down) I know... It's over....you've won... \nMR NICK Four rotten Russkies? \nDR. PARNASSUS And the girl..from the pub. \nMR NICK shakes his head. \nMR NICK Sally doesn't count.    Do you, gal? \nSALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms around NICK \nDR. PARNASSUS You're joking... toying with me. Like a cat with a mouse... As is your privilege. \nMR NICK Sal didn't get to make a real choice. You were gaga. Out for the count. Wouldn't be fair...And you've got four, thanks to your friend Tony. So... we're even... it's not quite over. \nHe smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag... \nMR NICK (CONT'D) Not quite. (checks his watch) Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11. \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED:                                               59 \n...and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY. Somewhere, a clock strikes 11. \nDR. PARNASSUS, agitated, watches him go. \nVALENTINA (V.O.) Father? \nDR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to him. He starts to round up the horses. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Valentina... my darling girl. We must do another show! Now! Quickly! Get ready to move out! \nVALENTINA Who was that? \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Somebody asking the way. Where's Tony? \nVALENTINA I overheard you... He wasn't asking the way. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Please! Get everybody together. Another show! Tony! Percy! \nVALENTINA I want to know what's going on. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (harnessing the horses) Not now. \nVALENTINA Yes, now! I want to know the truth! \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS The truth? \nVALENTINA What are you hiding? \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS There are more important things, at this moment! \n(CONTINUED) \n59   CONTINUED: (2)                                           59 \nVALENTINA It's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found Tony isn't it? \nPARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Yes. \nVALENTINA So tell me. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS What I told you was... the truth. I really am thousands of years old. I have been immortal. I have been mortal. And I have had many dealings with the devil. Too many. \nVALENTINA (fearful) What are you saying?... \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so... \nLooking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) ... so young. She was everything I had ever dreamed of. I made a choice. I bargained away my immortality. I regained my youth... and I won her. I did!

Thank God! \nTONY (to himself) How about thanking me? \nDR. PARNASSUS What? \nTONY I expect nothing in return. \nDR. PARNASSUS (trying to go into a trance) No. You're a saint... A saint. \nTONY Only Valentina's hand in marriage, if she'll have me... \nDR.

I can feel how right it is already. \nTONY leaps back to steady DR. PARNASSUS who looked as though he were about to topple off his pillar. \nTONY (CONT'D) Oh God!... Doctor... We can save her.. you and me. I need this. We both need this. Please. The trance. \nPARNASSUS quiets down.   Starts mumbling. \nTONY rushes to the mirror. Steps through. He finds himself standing amongst the stage scenery. Nothing else. \nTONY (CONT'D) Bugger! \nHe steps back out of the mirror.    Goes to PARNASSUS who is weeping. \nDR. PARNASSUS It's no good! \n(CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED: (3)                                           62 \nTONY shakes him hard. \nTONY PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!... Sir. Concentrate...or you'll have lost her forever. \nPARNASSUS slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state. \nTONY confirms he is in a trance, then rushes to the mirror. \nVALENTINA O/S Tony...oh, Tony.. \nWhat?! TONY stops. Looks around. There in the shadows huddles VALENTINA, sobbing. \nVALENTINA (sobbing) It's useless... Hopeless... I thought I was strong, but I don't even know how to run away... \nTONY hesitates.. No time! He looks back to PARNASSUS who seems to still be in his trance. Hesitates. Then rushes to VALENTINA. \nTONY It's alright... it's alright... Don't cry. It's going to be alright, believe me. \nVALENTINA This stupid theatre...!... That's all I've ever known...! I've always believed it was something precious, but it's not... it's a lie...I hate it! \nTONY lifts her up, putting his arm around her. \nTONY Everything's going to be alright... I'll take you away.

He's holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper. \nANTON Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's something m-might interest you. (reading) 'Missing: D-disgraced head of children's charity'. \nTONY No! \nTONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back. \nTONY (CONT'D) (shouting angrily) Ostanobuite bas menshi schit! \nThe litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can be heard playing garden party music. \nVALENTINA You did it! You made the right choice! \nThe light fills the screen and we find... \n...TONY, sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed, holding the smiling little girl. She too has been cleaned and buffed. The sun shines.

There is a marquee. \nWAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables bearing trays of drinks and food. \nTONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around. \n(CONTINUED) \n64   CONTINUED:                                                 64 \nTONY Sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. The problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons. \nTONY smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair. \nA GROUP OF GUESTS burst into spontaneous applause. Everybody loves and admires TONY. He smiles boyishly. \nHe moves on. The TV CREW stay with him. \nJOURNALIST Aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it? \nTONY Look, charity, like poor little Olga... (referring to the little girl) ...is always with us, to coin a phrase... \nVALENTINA appears. She is beautifully dressed, coiffed, made- up, she looks stunning. \nTONY (CONT'D) (to VALENTINA) Ah, there you are, my lovely. \nShe and TONY exchange broad smiles. They're in love. He pulls her to his side and puts his arm around her. The photographers snap away. \nJOURNALIST And what's your message to the Prime Minister? \nTONY (laughs engagingly) I wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the Prime Minister... Fortunately for the Foundation, I think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things. \nNow we hear a distant buzzing. EVERYBODY looks up. \n(CONTINUED) \n64   CONTINUED: (2)                                           64 \nThey see a speck in the sky, it's the PRIME MINISTER'S approaching helicopter... \nTONY and the posse of JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS rush off leaving VALENTINA standing alone. \n65   EXT   HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY                             65 \nThe PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE get out of the helicopter, followed by their AIDES.

Large beautiful photographs of the underprivileged children of the world line the walls. A great banner reads \"Suffer The Little Children Benefit Ball\" \nThe PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE are seated at the head table, facing the dais, bubbly and expectant. Security is heavy. \n67   INT   ENTRANCE HALL   NIGHT                                  67 \nTONY is conferring with his speech writers and assistants as VALENTINA descends the staircase looking utterly stunning in a beautiful gown. TONY bows, romantically kissing her hand. He turns her to admire their reflections in a gilt mirror...the perfect, beautiful, dream couple. \nTONY You look gorgeous, my love.   I knew you wouldn't let me down. \nThe little girl, OLGA, and a little boy are brought forward. They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door leading to the ballroom. \nTONY (CONT'D) (looking to everyone) This is a vitally important moment for the future of the Foundation. The children of the world are depending on us. \n(CONTINUED) \n67   CONTINUED:                                                    67 \nANTON (V.O.)

It's his imagination! \nTONY Call security, somebody. \nANTON (V.O.) It's all rotten! A naked lie! You've got to understand! \nGUESTS (O.S.) There he is! Stop him! Leave her alone. Get him! \nThrowing his arm around TONY, PARNASSUS spins him around to face the MOB rushing towards him. \nDR. PARNASSUS I create the opportunities. Is it my fault if your not up to it? \nTony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB. PARNASSUS is trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY. \nVALENTINA Father! No! \nPARNASSUS'S body lies broken on the ground. Frantically, VALENTINA rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's battered body, sobbing hysterically. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's all my fault. What have I done?... \nWith siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney. VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her. \nPARAMEDIC (with a severe stutter) P-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o, he-he-he's d-d-dead... \n(CONTINUED) \n68   CONTINUED: (3)                                              68 \nVALENTINA NOOOOO...!!! \nVALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC can finish speaking. \nPARAMEDIC ...d-dead drunk. \nA bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a million fragments as it hits the ground. \nThe shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs - sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections, some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY, irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS. \nVALENTINA (to her reflections) You little fool! You're to blame!.. for everything... I hate you! \nThe multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium. The one to the left is marked 'His' with a bowler hat, the other to the right 'Hers' with a bonnet. She hesitates. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) (laughing madly) So this is to be my choice!! \nMR NICK appears out of the \"His\" mirror - a burst of flame behind him. \nHe makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the mirror marked 'Hers'. \nVALENTINA, heads for the mirror marked 'His'. MR NICK blocks her path. \nMR NICK Now, there's absolutely no need for that. That's just plain contrariness. \nVALENTINA tries to get around him. \n(CONTINUED) \n68   CONTINUED: (4)                                            68 \nMR NICK (CONT'D) You think you deserve punishment but you're a kid - you have no idea...trust me. \nVALENTINA feints another direction. MR NICK blocks her. \nVALENTINA (a crazed look) Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now.. \nShe spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors. A tango can be heard. \nVALENTINA (CONT'D) ...a selfish bitch, everyone I love dies...I'm... \nMR NICK ...only fit for hell? If only. \nHe looks at Valentina with lascivious intent. He's tempted, briefly, but resists it. \nMR NICK (CONT'D) No... your pop would never speak to me again. And that'd be a shame. Let's dance. \nReflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through - and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss. \nThe mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments. \nDOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S Valentina!!!!!! \nMR NICK turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror fragment reflecting the two mirrors. The writing on the Valentina's mirror reads \"His\". \nMR NICK Damn!... I've won. \n69   EXT   STRANGE   MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE                           69 \nDR. PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) He's distraught. Tears run down this cheeks. A distant bell tolls midnight. \nMR NICK appears behind PARNASSUS...sits down beside him. \nMR NICK Funny how things work out, isn't it? \nHe lights a cigarette. \nMR NICK (CONT'D) It's not what I had in mind y'know... this.. Valentina, being the fifth... It doesn't seem right... She's supposed to be the prize, the star prize... not part of the bloody score... And you lumbered with eternal life all over again... What a bummer, eh? \nNo response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his hand. It is The Hanged Man. \nMR. NICK points to the plain far below. Across the harsh ground, TONY is running for his life...pursued by the MOB. \nMR NICK (CONT'D) I hope they get that bastard. Tear him limb from limb... But they won't... He leads a charmed life, that one... I've been trying to nail him for years... I thought I had him this time. But, there's always some prat comes to his rescue... Talk about the luck of the Devil. (he laughs) Those weird markings you found on him... on his forehead... Those satanic-symbol, so-called, things... What's all that about?... Maybe they protect him in some way... I've never been into that black-magic stuff myself... Can't seem to get the hang of it... I know, pathetic isn't it?... \nThe tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it. \nTONY Gotcha! \nTONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet, grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the chair, tightening the noose around his neck. \n(CONTINUED) \n70   CONTINUED: (3)                                             70 \nAlthough battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out of his gullet. \nWith a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him. \nThe MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead. \nDR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth. \nDR. PARNASSUS (hoarsely) There are three cardinal rules. One, there's no black-magic, only cheap tricks. And... er... I forget the others. Now, where's my daughter? \nMR NICK How should I know? You're her father. (with needle) Her loving father. \nDR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK. \nMR NICK (CONT'D) She's free... isn't she? \nMR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUS'S face. The smoke fills the screen and becomes... \n71   EXT   DESERT     DAY                                       71 \n... a dust storm. The wind is howling. The swirling dust thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging across a vast desert. \nHe's tormented by his thoughts. \nDR. PARNASSUS What else could I do, Valentina? What else could I have done... What other choice could I have made?... Damn!... It was the right choice... Of course it was... Of course... But where are you?

How long must I suffer? \nThere is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct paths. \nOne leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not to climb days earlier. \nDR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) No, no, no... No more choices, please... No more choices...!!! \nEnraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble. Exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone. \nVOICE (V.O.) (angry) Hey! \nDR. PARNASSUS, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone. \nNow on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of PERCY'S head and face. What he'd thought was a stone was, in fact, his old companion buried in the sand. \nDR. PARNASSUS Percy! \nDR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out. \nPERCY About bloody time! \nDR.

PARNASSUS'S cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction of the bungalow. We can now see the sign reads `Easy'... \nDR. PARNASSUS (on his dignity) No! Suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me. Dammit Percy! Stop! I've got my pride! \nPERCY Yeah, it goes just before the fall. \nPERCY grabs DR.

Beautiful, ethereal music. \nIn the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. \nThe HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the \"thumbs up\", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. \nReformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs.
